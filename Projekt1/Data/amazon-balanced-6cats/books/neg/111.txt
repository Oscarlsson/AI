There's no need to be wordy.

1. Biochemistry is a natural science
2. Natural science is defined as the "the rational study of the universe via rules or laws of natural order"
3. Intelligent design implies
A) Extraterrestrial design-- unlikely, although possible
B) Some nonphysical entity
4. If B, we are no longer in the realm of science

Even if Behe or proponent of ID feel Darwinian evolution to be inadequate, for an alternative proposal to be called scientific, it must be "based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning". 

This is basic scientic method. I learned it in middle school. Behe perhaps needs to be retaught.
