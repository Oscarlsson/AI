This was actually the first Kellerman novel I read and I found it kind
of dull at first, but that's only because I didn't know any of the
situations or people among whom I was thrust. After reading a couple
earlier books, I have re-read this one and I now find it interesting.
So, I would really have to recommend that one tries to read the series
more or less in order.

This one starts out with Alex Delaware seeing a new girlfriend named
Allison. Robin has married another man after some ten (?) years with
Alex. [I haven't read the one where she actually leaves yet (unless this
is the first mention of it), but if she broke his heart ... !] See, I
had no idea who Robin was first time I read this - makes a difference.
The cuuuuute little dog named Spike makes an appearance too. First time
I read it, he was just an irritating little squirt, but now I know just
how adorable he can really be and it was nice seeing him again.

Alex's police pal Milo is a lieutenant now and can pick and choose his
cases. He and Alex are together when they come across a grisly
crime scene. A young couple has been brutally murdered and the woman can
not even be identified. Milo draws Alex into the investigation and it
gets complicated. Everything seems to lead back to the dead boy's
psychologist and when she turns up murdered too, things really start
cooking with gas!

I adore Detective Milo Sturgis. I know Alex is the star, but I can't
help it. Milo is such a great character
