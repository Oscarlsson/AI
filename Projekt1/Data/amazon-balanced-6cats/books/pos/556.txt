This will be a present for my nephew George's 37th birthday. He loved
Curious George as a child, and still does. It's wonderful how someone
carries a love for a childhood toy, book, etc. throughout their life.
Such an individual eternally has a special spot in their heart
Kudos to Amazon for providing the book for $5.00 under market price.
