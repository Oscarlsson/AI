. . .maybe believe your suspenders, I'm not sure which.

It seems to me that to enjoy this book,
you have to suspend your suspicion of 
bombast and improbability. You also have
to give up any qualms you might have
about a protagonist who's pretty much 
a pedophile and whose connection to planet
earth seems pretty improbable.

What you get in return are some amazing
language, some great observations and 
a character whose zenny zest is intense
but not cartoonish. Much too cerebral to
ever be made into a movie by any director
alive now, this is a book to be enjoyed
as a pure artifact of whacked-out, but
craftsman-like writing
