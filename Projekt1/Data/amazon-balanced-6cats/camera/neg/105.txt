Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.

Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.
