I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro.
