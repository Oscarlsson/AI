For nearly $100, this adaptor provides very little (1.5X) magnification.  It is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly.  This is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor, which is used infrequently by me, but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance.  It is lightweight, but cumbersome and doesn't accept filters.  For real telephoto capabilities, get an SLR with interchangeable lenses.  I sent this product back.
