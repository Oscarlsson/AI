Description or product is wrong.  There is no quad independent power/charging indicators.  They are set up in banks of two.  One light for two charging bays. Batteries must be charged in banks of two.  Tried e-mailing Vidpro for additional info on this charger. E-mail came back as undeliverable.  Cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger
