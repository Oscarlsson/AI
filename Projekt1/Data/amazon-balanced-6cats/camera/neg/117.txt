I bought this lens for my Canon 30D after reading every professional review I could find.  I knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  I liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  I shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  The pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  I thought it might have been my new camera at first because I couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  I ruled this out after I used my Canon 28-105 lens I had for my Canon film SLR and the results were much better.  For the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.

Later, I decided on the Tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews.  The salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when I told him I had this Canon lens.  He said, "let me guess, you'd like to try the Tamron 17-50/2.8."  He said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. I could return it with no questions asked if I wasn't satisfied.  He also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet.  

My first images with this lens were great.  They were SHARP and had way more vibrant color.  There is absolutely no comparison at all.  I was hesitant to buy a third party lens but, my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results.  This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon.  I was so dissapointed that I wanted to help others not make the same mistake.  After spending $$$ on a digital SLR, it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens.  Before taking a chance on buying the Canon, do yourself a BIG favor and try the Canon and Tamron at a local store.
