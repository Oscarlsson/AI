When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture. 
After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever. 
The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures!
They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera.
