This kit is just junk. The &quot;deluxe blower brush&quot; is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a &quot;tweezers&quot; that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The &quot;lintless cleaning cloth&quot; is an about 3&quot; x 5&quot; piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges
