I purchased this camera in August 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is November 2006. Kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. Is that right?

It takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. You try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. I have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. I now have to go to my local photo place to get a CD and prints made and then download them into my EasyShare software. Oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.
Also, I had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. When I put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. 

This camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. The cost of shipping, CD's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.

Kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. What are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.

Do not purchase this camera, it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera
