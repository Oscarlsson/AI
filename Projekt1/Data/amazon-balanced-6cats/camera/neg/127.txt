To customer before me, you camera D200 might be on recall. Please check the Nikon website for more info. You have described the exact recall problem. Good luck! BTW, have you tried or someone tried this battery on a D70? I am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the D70 and grays from the D200.
