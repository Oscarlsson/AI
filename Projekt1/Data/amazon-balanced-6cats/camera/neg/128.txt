I purchased the 75-300mm for a trip to a NASCAR Nextel Cup Championship in Homestead, FL. I was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning. The lens is not very sharp, feels very cheap, and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light. 

I packed up and returned the lens about an hour after I got off the plane. I am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture. 

I suggest you do the same.
