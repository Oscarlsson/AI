Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was "refurbished" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for "refurbished" items is less than 6 months
