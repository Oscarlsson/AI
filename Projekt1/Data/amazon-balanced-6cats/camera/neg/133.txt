I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate. 

-Positives-
fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.

The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.

that's about it.

-Negatives-
The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.

The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.

Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.

It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).


I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak
