I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.  It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me.  So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online.  Just a word of warning to the ladies;-
