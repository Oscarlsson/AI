Someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size.  Well, that person isn't alone.  The camera I purchased is a Canon S2is, which I love.  The lense doesn't fit it.  I even bought the hood/lense adapter set and it STILL doesn't fit.  This simply is NOT the right lense for a Canon S2is, no matter what Amazon suggests.  Now, too much time has passed for me to return the lense.  I'm stuck with it, and I don't like that
