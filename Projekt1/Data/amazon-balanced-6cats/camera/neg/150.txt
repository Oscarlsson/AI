I was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today, but after reading the reviews I decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact.  
I'm sure it takes nice pictures, but a lot of cameras take nice pictures.  I have to go where the service will at least respect you.
