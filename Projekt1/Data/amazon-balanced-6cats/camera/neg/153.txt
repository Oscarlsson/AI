Don't buy this camera really.  I had it for a month and was taking good care of it.  I was initially thrilled.  The LCD screen got damaged -- no I didn't drop it.  The treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that I was shocked. The customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if I were an idiot.  A $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible.  It was a great camera at first, but I demand better treatment and respect from the company.  Look for a better camera, look on the web for comments on their customer service and don't buy this camera.  I had read very negative things about Sony but didn't think they applied -- they really are true.  I don't like being called a liar by anyone especially when I am the customer.  The camera is a month old and it is now garbage.  While I understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty, I will not accept such poor treatment and customer service.  I teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you, then do not buy this camera.
