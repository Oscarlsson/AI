I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. I need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. Edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. I shoot with a 20D.

The USM is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens I choose to buy in place of this one. The focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good
