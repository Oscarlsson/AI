Well of course I read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a US version... wrong!

I just received mine today and it's got the international warranty card and users manual. I haven't decided if I'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit
