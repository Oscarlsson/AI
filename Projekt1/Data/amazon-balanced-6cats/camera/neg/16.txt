I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.

I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.

I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.

When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.

I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  

Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords
