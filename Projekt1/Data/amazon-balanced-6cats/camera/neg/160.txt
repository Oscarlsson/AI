From reading the other reviews, I seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my A530.  Within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on.  I have to manually flick open the shutter/cover.  Then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to "zoom in" on something, to zoom back out I have to turn the camera off and back on.   To my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.  
I'm disappointed because I do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly. 
Fortunately, I bought it at Costco, so it's going back.
