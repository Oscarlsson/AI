Like most people I got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  I've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  Sure enough:
 * The shutter cover has often stuck open or shut.
 * Sometimes it refuses to start at all.
 * It sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera.
 * Finally, the LCD stopped working altogether.  This is after 8 months.

Casio has decided I'm not under warranty (no explanation as to why, no phone number to argue with them), and is charging me $97 to repair it.

Don't be seduced! It's a poor quality product
