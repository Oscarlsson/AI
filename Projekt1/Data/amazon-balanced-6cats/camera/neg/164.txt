I love Canon products and I have had a complete Canon system for about 10 years.   I love everything Canon does.  However I do not understand Canon's reasoning behind producing this lens.

The reason for the EF-S lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the "film" plane.  They cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an EF-S lens.

They have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   Why then do they produce a 60 mm Macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   I would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 USM Macro.

As I said, if for $60 I can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on ALL CANON CAMERAS, I'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all.

Granted, you might not be thinking of buying a FF camera anytime soon, but Canon has indicated that eventually they will have FF on all their DSLR's, so why bother with this lens?

The 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the EF-S lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me.
