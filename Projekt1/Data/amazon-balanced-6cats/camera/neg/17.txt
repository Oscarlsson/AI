I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.
