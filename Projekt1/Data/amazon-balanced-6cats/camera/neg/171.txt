I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake.  The class came chipped, scratched and smuged; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality.

Do yourself a favor, like I did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more.  This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting
