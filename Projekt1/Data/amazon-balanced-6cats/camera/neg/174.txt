As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)

The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months
