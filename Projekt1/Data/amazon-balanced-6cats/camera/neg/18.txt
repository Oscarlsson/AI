Beware of  assuming that  the UV filter recommended by Amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that I purchased is the correct  size.  It wasn't even close.  No size was given for the lense diameter. I returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping & all the hassel of  packaging it
