Don't buy this camera!!!  Prone to "Memory Error" & E18 errors after warranty is up.  Cost min $150 plus shipping to fix.

This camera was great until 23 months went by then I started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors.  I switched memory cards and it happened again.  Then the "memory error" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures.  Now it doesn't work at all.  I called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem.  Minimum cost is $150 or I could upgrade to a refurb S500 for $199 w/6 month warranty.  They have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one.  For what appears to be common problem I was expecting more from canon.  Guess I won't be buying another canon.

Google this "Canon "Memory Error" E18" and see for yourself that Canon cameras have problems.
