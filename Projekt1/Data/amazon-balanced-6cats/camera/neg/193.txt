The frame and the pictures it displays are fine.  Sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my PC.  My major complaint is the power supply.  The original power supply dies after 4 months.  It was repalced under warranty (after some grief with customer service).  The raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired.  I then had to buy one.  That one died after a few months and the company didn't have the replacement in stock.  After months of waiting from them to stock the item I gave up and after lots of searching on the web I found a supply made by another compay.  I had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame.  It's been doing fine since then.  I should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems.  It looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now.  I would do a lot of shopping before buying this one
