I purchased the 8 X 10 Photo Frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter.  I was able to get the product running and to load a 'test' set of pictures, but the product then 'froze' at the startup screen.  I checked the Pacific Digital support website, which provided steps (basically, a sequence of buttons to hold down) to 'unfreeze' and reinitialize the unit.  I tried this sequence several times, to no avail, and then called Pacific Digital customer service.  After repeated messages left on a voice mail system ("we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back to you") at all times of the day and night, I was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned.  Long story short - our wedding came and went, the problem was never (and will apparently never be) resolved, and the Digital Photo Frame is now a $390 paperweight.  Absolutely useless.  My recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCT.  This is clearly a fly-by-night outfit
