Gosh, i would really like to review this adapter, but---

Amazon has put my order on indefinate hold, as thier supplier is unable to get any more. 
But wait! What's that blurb on the product page -"Availability: Ususally ships within 24 hours" and "Want it delivered Tomorrow? Order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes, and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout. See details."

So they can't deliver it, yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow? Don't order from Amazon
