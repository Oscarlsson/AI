I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it.  For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot.  It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again
