I paid extra for Air Next Day service.  Item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately.  Item eventually arrived two weeks later.  I had left for a trip.  Item was eventually sent back to merchant.  Merchant didn't credit me for item returned.  I had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited.  I won't buy from Willoughby's again
