This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.

The camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. But the results are disappointing. The sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (Canon) offers. Nikon finally realized this and on Dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. It just so happened mine was in Melville, N.Y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. These include bad AF performance since upgrading to V2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the VR lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.

I would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward Nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. Indeed, forget Nikon and go to Canon
