I bought this for my 8 year old daughter to begin learning about digital photography. It has been nothing but a headache from day one. We have yet to be able to download any pictures. All of the endless number of pictures she has taken have been erased before we can download them. The one button mode is very confusing and the directions although written in English seem to be in a foreign language.  The directions say do not return to the store if you are having difficulties. You are suppose to call the phone #, but good luck getting through. I've tried for 2 days straight. They apparently are experiencing high call volume from all the other unhappy customers who were fooled into buying this "Educational camera".  As I am shopping for another camera, I will not buy anything from the company who manufactured this camera-  Sakar
