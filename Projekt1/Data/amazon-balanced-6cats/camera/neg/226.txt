i had just recently bought this camera, and it was OK. the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok. i couldnt really understand it, and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid CD that comes with it and now i cant install it. overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of JUNK. now im begging my parent to buy me a REALL DIGITAL CAMERA!!not a peice of crap.
