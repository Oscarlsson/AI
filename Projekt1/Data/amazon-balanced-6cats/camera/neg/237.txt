Conclusions:

To start from the end I got the Xacti CA6, tested it and returned it. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros - 
1. Very small, just put in your pocket and go
2. Easy and simple controls
3. Super fast start up from sleep mode
4. Good video quality when lighting conditions are good
5. the ability to take stills while in video mode (I had no issue with the video pausing, no way around that)
6. You get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price
7. SD card that records for a long time
8. Easy transfer to computer for editing 

Cons - 

1. Indoor video unacceptable, although the video is brighter the ones my Sony digicam takes, it is extremely grainy (more so than my Sony digicam videos!!)
2. Super slow zoom when in video mode
3. In good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry (especially when trying to capture a kid on the move, for scenery it might be OK)
4. In low lighting stills are unusable (even at short distance) due to a very, very weak flash.
5. Red eye almost every time the flash works
6. Strap is a joke
7. No lens cover

So in short, on paper this camera is great, I love having the SD format rather than tape or DVD, the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless. 
But....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting (see above) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions (for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical).
This camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand (for taking stills). For almost everyone else it is not adequate, I will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a miniDV camcorder  (going for the Elura 100).....
Ya, I know people told me that this was the best option beforehand, I was hoping to prove them wrong....; - (
