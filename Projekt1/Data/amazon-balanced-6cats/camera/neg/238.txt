In an email, Adorama specified that the filter diameter was, "28mm." On the amazon.com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting! Either they don't know their products or they don't care about the customers. Now I have to return it because of faulty information they supplied. Please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25% of the purchase price - an amount I feel is beyond absurd. I can buy this locally for a lot less (even though I would have to pay sales tax). Buyer beware
