My cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so I ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one.  Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures.  I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair.  First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched.  When I pushed delete, the menu came up.  Even the mode selector wasn't working.  It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes.  I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable.  I am done with this camera
