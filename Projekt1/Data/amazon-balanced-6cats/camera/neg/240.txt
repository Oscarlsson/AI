It worked fine the first week. Then the focus stopped working. I sent it to repair. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working. I sent it for repair for the second time. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working. Also, it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at SONY!!! They make you wait over an hour!!!
Si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for!!!
