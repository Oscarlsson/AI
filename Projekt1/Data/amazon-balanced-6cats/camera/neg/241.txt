After a few months use the camera got persnickety, often demanding upon startup that I restart it. Now that the camera has completely broken down, with the lens fully extended and stuck in place, I think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate. Another durability issue concerns the finish: the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review, flash, etc., quickly wore off, and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera. Not a big deal in itself, but annoying given the other problem.

The lens is prone to strange flaring, especially indoors, where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame. Several photos were ruined, or have required tedious photoshopping. Otherwise, the lens is fine and reasonably sharp, although nothing to write home about.

The camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models, e.g., Canon A610. Many frames are motion-blurred, as well. There are ways to avoid this, but I didn't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure, thank you.

There are a few things to recommend it: Not only is it relatively inexpensive, it has a lens significantly wider than the competition--31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm. Those few mm's make a big difference when you can't move back far enough to get everything in the frame. It is also quick in its operations (except when hunting for focus, see above.) The jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful--bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost--but generally everything looks good. Skintones are good.

Still, with the durability issue, this one's not worth it. Lucky for me, unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown, I did keep the receipt. Anyone wanna buy a memory stick pro duo
