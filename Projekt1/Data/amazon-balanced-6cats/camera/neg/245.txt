I was super-excited to get this camera, and very disappointed with it once I did.  The pictures are blurry far more often than not, even when resting the camera on a table or solid object.  Additionally, it's so slow at taking them that ANY movement (eyes blinking, etc) likes like a massive blur.  And the video skips all the time.  It just misses entire parts.  I would highly recommend NOT getting this camera.
