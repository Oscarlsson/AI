I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least.
