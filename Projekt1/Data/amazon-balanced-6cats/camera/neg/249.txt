I purchased this item two weeks ago.  My thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced, perfect addition to the "tools" necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby (its advertised contents, construction, and "glow-in-the-dark" planisphere).  After closely examining the item for the past ten days, I'm forced to conclude that I was in error, and that you really do get what you pay for.  As Celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy, I must confess that I assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name.  I have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps.  The major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings, letter transpositions, apparent omitted words, and just plain (what we used to call in the old days) "typographical errors."  Additionally, when I compare some of the technical information on the maps (i.e., star magnitudes, astronomical distances, etc.)and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources I have in my possession, I also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances.  When using a product like this, it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains.  Since I'm not able to do this, I must rate this item with one star.  When I purchased the item, it was marked down by twenty percent.  I note that in less that two weeks since my purchase, the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent.  In this case, don't be fooled (as I was) by an attractive price.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT. (I don't have a substitute to recommend at this time.)
