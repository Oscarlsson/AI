With this pup it is simple to record video or images and almost impossible to download them successfully!  In standard mode, the playback of video is anything but smooth.  Looks like an old time movie.  

The software could best be described as, "User Hostile".  I haven't been able to download any videos without getting an error message before the transfer is complete.

The normal video isn't as good as my DV camcorders and downright sad indoors.  The photo portion is slightly better than my cell phone (a pocket pc).  Still pictures haven't downloaded successfully either (approximately 11 out of 185 have made it across the wire before error messages start interrupting the transfer).

It's a handy size and easy to operate.  After you're done recording you'll likely spend a lot of time with the manual (I have) and then you start getting frustrated.

If I could return it, I would
