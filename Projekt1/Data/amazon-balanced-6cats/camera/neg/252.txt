I am fascinated with this machine.   It has incredible detail although it lacks a little lattitude and details are lost as soon as there are some shadows.

The battery so far usually lasts me the whole day when I go touring.   If I take care to shut the display down as soon as I dont need it anymore I find that when I am on a cruise ship or visiting another country I can take all the movies I usually want - - and recharge when I get back to my room at night. 

The only problem is playback on a TV or PC.   The bundled software made by ULEAD is not user friendly and, whereas the previous Xacti I had played back images and video clips in the order I had taken, this one separates  them and plays back either clips or images.   Before I played back through my Panasonic Hard Disk DVD recorder and recorded a DVD directly.   Now I have to go into my PC and do a whole lot of editing and so far the "Movie FActory" program keeps crashing.

I imagine somebody will eventually suggest a better software program, or I will learn to use Ulead, but for the time being the pictures and clips Ihave taken have very good detail, and the machine has operated flawlessly.
