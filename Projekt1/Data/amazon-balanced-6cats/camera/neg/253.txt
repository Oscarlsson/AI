Great features, right?
I just returned it after very disappointing results.
Here are just a few issues:
1. If you use a tripod (and you WILL need to), you can't plug in the AC adapter to save on the short battery life, because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the AC connection.
2. Battery life is very short.
3. If you want to protect the lens, you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens.
4. You can't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter BECAUSE the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures.
5. The automatic settings are horrible. The auto focus, auto white balance, auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors.
6. You cannot adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording.
7. Quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light.

Save your money. Buy a camera with better features. I am waiting for the Panasonic HDC-SD1 due in March
