I am still giving this camera 2 Stars because... I may have used the wrong settings when taking photo's. 
But... I ended up with "a lot" of blurred and fuzzy photo's. "example... when we went bowling, almost every photo was blurred or had those acid trip looking streaks."
My Biggest complaint is the battery door broke completely in half in less then 4 months of use.
You might expect that out of a $30 Dollar Camera but "NOT" a $3 Hundred Dollar one.
I paid $284.99 for the camera, $47.99 for the 1 GB SD Memory Card and $51.54 for the Docking Station and that didn't include S&H or Taxes, they were extra $$$!
My husband replaced this one for me with the Kodak EasyShare C743 and G600 printer dock and it's a 7.1 MP and it takes better quality pictures that I can print @ home for less then this one. ($249.95 W/FREE Shipping & Handling and 1 GB SD Memory Card included) from K O D A K online
