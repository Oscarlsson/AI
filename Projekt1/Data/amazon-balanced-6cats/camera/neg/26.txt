I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT.  Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit.  I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu.  Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one
