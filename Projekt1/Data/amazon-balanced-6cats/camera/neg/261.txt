I had this camera for about a month and the first time it broke, I don't know why it broke. I set it down and when I turned it back on, it had cracked. I then bought another LCD screen and repaired it myself, but two weeks later, I had a CASE for it, and put it in my purse. I carried my purse around and had not set my purse down. When I took it out, it had cracked again. I would not recommend getting this camera
