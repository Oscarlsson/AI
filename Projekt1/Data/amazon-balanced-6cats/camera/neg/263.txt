I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case. 
Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.
