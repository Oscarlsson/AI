so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like "um... is THAT it???" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards... 

also, there is no HP embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that I got is really cracked and does not look good at all... 

other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there.
