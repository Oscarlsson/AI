I owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me, and I said "THANK YOU!" because I hated the thing.  I used to have a 4mp Samsung and it was better than this one.  

The worst problem: Slow.  Slow slow slow.  If you use the flash, be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture.  It's worse at low battery strength, but even with fresh batteries it was tedious.

The other thing that disappointed me was the color.  The light from the flash is glaring and unnatural, and without the flash everything is reddish, grainy, and blurry.  I never found a decent middle ground.  I take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light, and my Samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one.  When I look at the pictures I've uploaded on my computer, I can see the difference when my old camera died and I got the Nikon.

The worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing I owned THAT one.

Do some research before you make a mistake like I did. I've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera
