I purchased this camera right before we had our first child. Needless to say, I would have rather donated the money to charity! The flash recovery time is ridiculously slow, but that I can live with. The 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry, I can not. Now I have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on. Needless to say I think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera
