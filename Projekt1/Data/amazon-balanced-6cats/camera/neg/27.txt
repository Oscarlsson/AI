I was expecting much more from this flash, I already started looking for the better one. If I knew this was a closeout item I'd never buy it. It died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. Now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries...
Save money and buy 5XX series flash..
