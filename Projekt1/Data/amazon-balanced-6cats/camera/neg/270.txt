Unless you take picture outside, no matter what you do, the picture comes out blurry.
Flash doesn't help at all- it takes more than 5 seconds for it to take a picture, and you still get a blurry picture with horrible quality indoors. 
My sister had a camera from Olympus, with 5 megapixel and 3x zoom too, but I found it so much easier to take a picture(and a better one too) with that one. 
Unless you want to buy your 5th grader his/her toy camera, you shouldn't consider nikon 5600.
