I made sure I did my research and read all the reviews on various cameras before deciding to go with this one.

I was highly disappointed when I got my camera home and put in the batteries, turned it on and immediately  the lens got stuck in the "out" position with an error reading that said:  lens error, restart camera.  I tried to restart it a zillion times, only for it to say the same thing.  I went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now, instead of being excited about having this particular camera, I am completely disappointed.  

I'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras.  Please research the error because, in some cases, it didn't happen until a year later
