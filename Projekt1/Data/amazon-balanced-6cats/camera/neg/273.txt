I bought htis from Amazon, and have troubles in playing back the video clips. Almost evrytime, after a while, I do see "System error" on the screen, and then the firmware is hung. After a power-cycle, the last recorded clip is gone! Some issues with the basics...so I called Sanyo service, they said this is happening because I'm using a 4GB plain SD card. Acc to the support guy, max of 2GB of plain SD is supported , for more GB, a SDHC card is needed. I could not find this info on the manual or spec...so I'm not sure how true is this. If anyone of you know about this , please let me know.

Video is okay for my need...still is too bad. 
Firmware is just about average..not too great. There is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons.

Battery did not perform as promised in the spec. 

Also, there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product. I would expect those many in a robotics kit.
