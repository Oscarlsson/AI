I have to say I am very disappointed with this camera.  I had really high hopes for this one.  I waited for the hd2 to come out and when I saw a lot of positive reviews I bought one, I should have waited.  For Sanyo to call this an HD camera doesn't make sense.  The picture has more grain and noise then my old High 8 camera.  Outdoors in bright light the camera is ok. Low-light is horrible 

Pros:
- Nice form factor, love the look and feel and it's so tiny it fits in your pocket.  Very portable and something you can take anywhere. 
- Secure Digital cards are great, can transfer and edit on the computer quickly
- Still pictures are pretty good.  Although still digital cameras are better.
- HDMI output can plug directly into your HDTV (although if you are used to watching things in HD you will be disappointed)

Cons:
- Indoor and Low light situations very grainy, even with the high sensitivity button.
- Don't attempt to take still shots while you are filming, it works but when you watch the film you hear loud noises and the shot pauses for 2 or 3 seconds and then continues.  Very cheesy.
- You can hear the data being written to the secured digital card on the video which is annoying.  I thought SD was supposed to minimize noise.  
- Watching the playback of movement with this makes me dizzy, not even fast movement either.
- Image stabilization is not that great either compared to other cameras I have used.
- Audio sounds a bit tinny 

In my opinion this camera is geared for portability and being able to capture moments quickly as this is something you can always carry with you.  If you aren't too concerned with quality picture it's probably fine. I really think Sanyo has a great concept and one day this could be the end all be all device.  For now it should come with a warning of it's limitations.  I am not saying it's total garbage, but if you have high hopes like I did, you will be disappointed.
