I got mine today, and it is being returned today.  I had high hopes, given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity.  I was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video.  Here's my results:

1) Stills.  Pictures are not too bad, but do not compare with a similar 7MP Canon SD500 which I own.  The zoom works well, focusing is ok, but slow.  The pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them, flash or not, like they are all taken at a high ISO setting on a regular digital cam.  So slight disappointment here.

2) Video.  If this is improved low light sensitivity, I would not have liked to see the results on the HD1!  Video does not even come close to comparing to my regular Sony DV camera.  Focusing is hit or miss, and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my Sony.

I really was hoping for the be all end all combo device, but the HD2 does neither very well.  Ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well.  The finish is great and the buttons are well placed.  But it doesn't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves
