I purchased this along with a Sony DCRHC21.  This Carry case was listed as an accesory so I expected it to be appropriately sized (as other Sony cases I've purchased fit like a glove).  This  case is entirely too large to hold a miniDV camcorder.  The camcorder rattles around inside it.  If you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one.  Otherwise I suggest you look at the Product Specifications, note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder's size.
