At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts.  The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  This is a lens that I have constantly fought with.  Don't upgrade to the new 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.

Buy the 70-200 f/4L.  It's a far superior lens
