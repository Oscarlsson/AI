After a week of using this I find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing.  Mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect, so maybe the motor was already fixed :-)  My mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender.  The ZR 500 is OK in low light, but you CAN adjust the exposure manually to correct if it isn't to your liking. You can also adjust the focus too!

My friend who is a mini DV guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par.  

I've made two practice DVD's (with firewire, no problem at all) with this camera and like what I see.  

For those of you that have bad motornoise: try your video software to edit the noise out.  Power Director has that feature.

I am happy with this product, but I would rather have a higher end model now that I have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder.
A great camcorder for beginners!
