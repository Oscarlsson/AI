I have owned the S410 camera for almost two years, when on New Years Eve I pulled out my handy camera, from the padded case it's always in, and to my horror, the E18 error message appeared! It hasn't worked since. I paid $400 for this camera and Canon would like $110 (plus taxes) to fix the problem - ridiculous. Especially since this seems to be a VERY common problem with their cameras. I've enjoyed the camera's picture quality and ease of use, but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years! Beware of this flaw that Canon doesn't seem to acknowledge
