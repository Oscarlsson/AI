When I got this camera for my birthday April 2005 I thought that it was a dream come true. The picture quality was brilliant, it was easy to use. The device was ment to be envied. It took marvelous pictures until within 3 months, July 2005- the LCD screen cracked. The camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage. I was never suspiscious of it until I took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems. Something bad will happen to this camera. Either the sceen will break or the memory card thing. A friend of mine also owned the s410, and her screen broke before mine did. 
The camera still takes photos, but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options. It is not worth the price of repair. Tomorrow I am going to buy a new camera.
