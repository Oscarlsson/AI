Not impressed at all with this product.  You are better off just to plug in your camera in the USB port and let Windows process it.  At least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved.  I suggest you don't use Easyshare software.  Windows Pic and Fax Viewer is far superior to this software.  If you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use Easyshare.  The solution to this is to uninstall Easyshare and all pics with revert to Windows
