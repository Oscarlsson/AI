I purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera.  When I was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house, there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo.  When I took a photo outside, there was no shadow.  I went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said I would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room, but he said, in reality, 'these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments'.  I did experiment with the light balance, but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear.The flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks.  I returned the product.
