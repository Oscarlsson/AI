Probably a very good case, but not a very operatable one in the field - you have to undo two closures to open the camera compartment, a strap and a velcro.  The shoulder strap is not detachable - looks kind of silly when you are trying to use the belt strap.  For the Olympus Stylus digital cameras, look to the Lowepro case - better case and value
