The product advertisement is misleading or incomplete (no picture of the actual contents).  The following quote is from Fuji Mall:

"AC Adapter: Charge your batteries at home or around the world with the travel adapters."

What it fails to mention is that the charger is an external charger only, and you cannot power the camera or charge batteries while in the camera. I was looking for an AC Adapter that I can power the Camera (and charge it's batteries inside the camera).

The NiMH cells are not the 2500 ma/hr rating that comes with the E900 camera (they are 2000 ma/hr, but this was noted in the product specifications).

I teach a photography class and needed an AC Adapter to power each camera used during the class while demonstrating.  This product does not meet this criteria.  It can however charge up to 4-AA Batteries at a time, and includes an Auto Adapter which is handy.

Case is Bulky, not small enough to tote an E900 conveniently when not bringing the charger equipment
