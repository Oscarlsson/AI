I will keep this review simple.

For the price this is an ok deal.

However:
The bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop.
The battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality
Batteries are generic rechargeables.

You are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger/batteries. It will wind up costing you less in the long run
