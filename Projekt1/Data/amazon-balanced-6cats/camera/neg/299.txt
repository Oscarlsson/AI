If you can actually get the picture to turn out right, it does take pretty decent pictures.  Most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy.  It also only holds about 5 pictures, so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot.  I was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars, and it doesn't really seem worth it
