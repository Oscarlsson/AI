This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it.
