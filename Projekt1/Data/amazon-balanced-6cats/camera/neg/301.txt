I purchased this camera after reading reviews and tech specs about the camera. It's either not enough, or it's too much ... I'm not sure which. I returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel Powershot A640 which has a swiveling view finder (which is great!) and will suit my needs just fine for about $200 less.
