i bought this toy a year ago and tried it on my ETX-90EC telescope all i got  is hazy moon video,the resolution is poor 
the maximum pixels is 640*420 which is very pooooooor resolution it didnt reach even 1 mega pixels , hey we've got now 12 MegaPixels chips why dont provide it celstron ???
tried to edit it with the included poor software but it was useless
i thought it might need bigger telescope so the aperture would be higher and  i might able to see some stars or galaxies as per advertisement
i went to my cousin who has LX90 8" telescope, the result was bright dots seem to be stars
i dont recommend this toy its a waste of money
if you want really to take serious photograph try to attach your film or digital camera to your telescope by T-Adapte
