I can't speak to how well the product performs because mine was DOA.  Customer Service was unable to do anything over the phone.  Since it was purchased as a gift and I had time before Christmas, I opted for a different brand.  Doesn't inspire confidence in their quality control when a unit fails to start up fresh out of the box
