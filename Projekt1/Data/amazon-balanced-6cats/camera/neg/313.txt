I was very excited to see this frame, and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek. I was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality - it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago. The resolution was similar to my first palm pilot (IIIx), just enlarged.

I sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces. I believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better
