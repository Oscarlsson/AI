they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill. The batteries charged lasted atleast five hours, so no complaints there, but the charger would keep coming out from the wall. It only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it wouldn't stay all the way in, I tried several outlets, finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all
