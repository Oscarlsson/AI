I wish that I could review how well this charger works, but unfortunately I can't.  The reason is because it was dead on arrival.  I essentially bought a $20.00 (with eek technology's outrageous shipping) brick.  It never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit!  At least I have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss.  Don't make the same mistake.  Steer clear of this piece of junk
