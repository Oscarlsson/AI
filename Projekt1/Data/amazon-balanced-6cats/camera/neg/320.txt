"lens error, restart camera" message appears today (mar 26) after buying production on amazon on feb 20, 07. When I searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon. I have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue. I dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users(after reading user feedback on web)
