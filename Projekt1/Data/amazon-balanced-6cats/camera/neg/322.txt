The wifi is a great idea!  The idea on paper sounds amazing, but the way you had to do it was horrible.  it gave you no control over what pictures or anything.  plus it was slow.

The Picture quality was HORRILBE!!!  M y two Megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera.  They look AMAZING on the LCD screen, but once you get them on the computer, they are fuzzy, grainy, etc.

I would not recomend this camera to anybody.  yes, it has some nice features, but the pictures are anything but acceptable
