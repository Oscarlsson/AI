The camera feels slick.  The software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency, though the intuitiveness is not its strength.  While the large LCD display is terrific (the main reason I got it), It is worthless in a high glare situation.  You can't see what you are shooting.  It's worthless!  And since Nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations, there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting.
While the viewing wheel, to rapidly cycle through the shots you've taken, is quite handy, the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive, and often takes so long to figure out that you give up.  Pictures are generally good, though the conditions have to be perfect, or you get grain or blur.

There is one lovely feature, but it is only useful on a tri-pod.  It is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background.  It creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix.  I use that feature a lot, but its worthless without "legs" for the camera.

I bought this on a whim, counting on the Nikon reputation.  Had I known, I would have stuck with the Canon
