I really don't know how to write a "helpful" review for this camera, I'm not a photographer; all I can say is that I was NOT satisfied with my purchase, so...

If you're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get (like I was a few months ago), save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras.

Here are my complaints:

Flash is too strong (blinding, in fact). Please do NOT take this complaint lightly, the flash is brighter than you think (it actually HURTS, I'm talking physical pain here). I actually fear it might have some long term effects, this alone is a deal-breaker for me! It's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at Nikon.

Sure, you can turn the flash off. But that only brings me to my other major complaint! The lighting must be almost PERFECT if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash.

The lens do not respond well to artificial lighting, AT ALL, pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background.
Even when the lighting is almost perfect, you lose a LOT of quality (even when using the highest settings, 6MP).

The scene modes didn't help much, I tried everything, all the different modes offer so little difference, very gimicky in my opinion.

Even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash, there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear, why? I have NO clue what so ever. I might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a SLIGHTLY different pose (but still stable), and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear!

Must admit though, the swivel design is VERY practical and makes things so much easier. The video mode is great as well.

If you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash, then I must admit, the pictures do come out nicely. (most of the time
