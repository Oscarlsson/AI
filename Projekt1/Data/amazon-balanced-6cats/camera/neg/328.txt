I agree with the people complaining about the poor CS policy at JVC. They let me down as well, when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built. 
I am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid JVC in the future. I just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit. This will come back and bite them in the behind
