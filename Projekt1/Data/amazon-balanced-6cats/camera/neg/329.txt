This camera was great at first and very easy to use, however, the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well.  When we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture, so we put it in our cedar chest (we keep our house very dry and don't live in a humid area - Nebraska).  This worked for a few months, but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless.  I wish it was different, but bottom line, this is a disposable video camera - a nice one, but still disposable
