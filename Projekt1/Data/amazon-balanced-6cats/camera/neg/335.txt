this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine.

what i liked about it:
1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use
2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice
3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've used

what i disliked about it:
1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest
2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work.
3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before)

this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events
