I have had both the S5000 and the S5100 I was disapointed when my S5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months, but I was happy with the picture quality. I replaced it with the S5100, it has a slightly better feature set over the S5000 (in particular shutter speed choices) while on a trip to Niagara Falls, I was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt (and I mean slight) after that it wouldn't power up. I am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable.
