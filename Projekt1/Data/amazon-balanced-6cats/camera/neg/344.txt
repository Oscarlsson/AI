I purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend.  I will start out by saying that when I first purchased this frame, I loved it.  The display, contrast and brightness were great. 

However, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny.  They get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage.  Turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.  

Myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue.  In conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons.
