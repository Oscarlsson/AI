I bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents.  Two of them stopped working.  One of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped.  Unfortunately, out of the warranty period!  And inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored.

I'm out a lot of money for this garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!!
