Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off
