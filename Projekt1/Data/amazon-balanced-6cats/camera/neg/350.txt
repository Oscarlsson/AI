I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were "acceptable," at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain
