We have had this camera for about a year.  We wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake.  The picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working. We have a Canon Powershot A60 as well and have been very happy with the performance.  I would not recommend this Polaroid camera to anyone
