this camera is a piece of junk. you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture. and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out. not to mention the battery life is horrible. i got a 1 GB memory card so i could take lots of pictures, but the battery runs out after i took about 10. so all in all, if you're considering buying this thing, save the money and frustration and just don't
