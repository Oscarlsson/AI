I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera! 
She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable.
Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!
