I bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars.  I have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit.  The set I received did not have the extention straps included.  The harness was the same as all the other harnesses I could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back.  If you are buying these because of the extention straps, you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars.  They were well made, just not the same item as shown in the picture
