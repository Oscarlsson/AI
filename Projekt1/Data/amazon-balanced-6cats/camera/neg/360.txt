This item was offered as a suggested accessory to the Nikon Monarch ATB 8X42 Waterproof Binoculars that I purchased.  I later also purchased the 12X42 Binoculars.  This harness CAN NOT be attached to either pair of binoculars!  The hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars.

Other than that the harness is a well made quality product
