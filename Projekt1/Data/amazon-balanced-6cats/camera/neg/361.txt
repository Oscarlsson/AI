I have had several people take my pictures.At first,everything is fine.The pictures are ok.THE NEXT DAY,my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.It is soooo blury.Then it got 2 the point where every picture I took was blury.I tried fixing it online(like on the program for the camera)and it would not work.I HATE THIS CAMERA!!! Not to mention the battery sucks.It lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.This camera should be $99.00.TRUST ME PEOPLE......IF I COULD RATE THIS THING AT A ZERO I WOULD.IT IS NOT WORTH IT.HOWEVER,a camera i absolutely love is the Sony Cybershot DSCT5.An awesome little camera
