I've owned this camera a little over a year. It was my 2nd digital camera. It always had focus issues in low-light. I thought it was me, but after working extensively with the manual, after I finally had some time, I discovered that it was the camera. You really need a tripod for those low-light shots. I wasn't able to return it, so I've taken hundreds of pictures with it. It takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen. However, the lens will no longer contract and I get an error message that is unresolvable unless I pay at least $170. I'm just going to get a better quality camera. I will not buy Sony again
