This tripod seemed to be very nice...  Until we tried to extend the legs all of the way.  Two and a half of the legs worked well, the third had a section that would not stay extended.  The locking devices are pretty poor.  They are made of a cheap plastic and I believe that even the ones that do work well now, will not last very long with even moderate use.  Next time I will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock
