The Adorama Silica Gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it. I emailed customer service at Adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond. I can't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready. What color should it be and what color should indicate recharging. How to I recharge it? Nothing tells me how to recharge it. So far, money wasted. Unresponsive to my emails
