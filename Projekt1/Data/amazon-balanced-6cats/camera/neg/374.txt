I read all the reviews and comments on this Kodak printer I could find. Many gave glowing reviews. I'd just purchased a new Kodak digital camera, and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup. 

I was never able to get the printer to perform as Kodak says it should. It caused some odd conflict, and my computer would not boot into Windows XP with the printer attached to the computer. I ended up having to disconnect the printer, turn on my computer, and then reconnect the printer in order to use it. Windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers. It was made even more frustrating by Kodak's tech support. I called and emailed multiple times for assistance. In one conversation I was literally told "I don't know what's wrong and can't help you." Now that's tech support!

Finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper. I tried all Kodak's remedies, none worked. No matter how much or how little paper was in the machine, it said there was no paper. I even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print.

I can't recommend this printer. I could give a better recommendation had Kodak itself, through its tech support, at least have provided my with some competent assistance. I got about 2 dozen prints, quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all.

About the only positive I can give is that the prints I did get looked good, the color was nice. I gave it an extra star for print quality alone.

Kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time. It was synonymous with home photography once upon a time. They've lost something over the years, and that is quality
