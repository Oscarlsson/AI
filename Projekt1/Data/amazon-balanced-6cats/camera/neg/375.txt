I will start off by saying, I loved my Sony Cybershot.  When the Alpha came out I couldn't wait to get one.

It died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through South America.

Amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. 

I've spent 3 hours so far dealing with Sony.  Most people I spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to Business Support, Computers, Video.  They also contradicted one another.

When I did get to someone who knew the product I was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.

Now I am stuck with a lemon, and I fear I have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.

I highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  Other people have had problems with the camera, I ignored them because I had faith in Sony and thought the other Alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.

If you decide to purchase anyway, I highly recommend you do not buy through Amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  Places like Microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  I am kicking myself because Amazon was $100 cheaper then Microcenter.  Penny wise pound foolish.

I love Amazon, but, I will never buy anything other than books and DVDs from them.  Lesson learned on electronics.
