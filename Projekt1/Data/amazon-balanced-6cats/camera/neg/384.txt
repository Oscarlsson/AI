I'm going to be completely honest with you. I hated the HP camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. I've had an old HP camera and I have had this newer HP camera and they are all the same. It doesnt seem like it really matters what MP they are. Still bur's out and it is disappointing. I guess it really depends on the person about this camera but I'd rather have a Sony, Samsung, or some other company's item. =
