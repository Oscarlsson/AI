This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]

Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.

But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good.

In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??
