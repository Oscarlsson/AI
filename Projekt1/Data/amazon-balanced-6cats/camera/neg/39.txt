Amazon's aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them to cancel it. I will never buy from Amazon again. I bought over 100 items over 5 years. I purchased the camera on a 1 day delivery plan. They then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive to a photographer's needs. I cancelled order 2 days before it ships, they say sorry we cannot cancel. 2 days??? come-on. I guess the $3000 just creates nice interest.
The end for me and amazon, I do not like this kind of "aggressive marketing".

Good advice, Rather buy direct from B&H Photo, pay double if you like, but you will get what you pay for there, not aggressive marketing and shoving of a product down your throat at their terms.
I am truly annoyed. Run, hide.
