This is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures.  And it takes wonderful video. The downloading is easy and in general it's a "fine" camera.  However....

the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare.  It's constantly over exposing every subject.  I find it practically un-usable.  The only way I can get the image I'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the ISO to 800.  If it had a 1600 ISO I wouldn't need the flash at all practically but it doesn't offer that.  

The other thing I don't like that I didn't realize I wouldn't like is that it doesn't have it's own cradle in which to charge the batteries.  The batteries have to be removed and charged seperately.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it.  The batteries lose their charge even when the camera isn't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice.  Intensely dissatisfying.  

This camera also has a REALLY LONG DELAY from pushing the button to taking the picture.  This results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces.  I know that most digitals have a delay but this one is EPIC.  

I am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a Canon.  I am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my Canon 5D.  But since this was rated Camera of the Year by American Photo (a publication I trust implicitly), I decided to stray from my Canon.  bad idea.  I'm going right to a PowerShot.  Do not pass go.  Do not collect $200.  I reccommend you do the same.
