I no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder, so I finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until I could get back on my feet to get another good one. I thought this one may do, good price, looks sharp, purchased on impulse . . .big NO-NO.

I will say the camera takes decent pictures (as the previous reviews state, almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with
very good lighting). Other than that, don't bother. The MP3 is a cute
function (and quite possibly the most practical). The video, UHH, let's
not even go there. The voice recorder, also not bad - records in WAV format and can be transferred to PC. 

Jack of all trades, master of none . . .I guess that would be the best
way to finally describe this item. I will say that I'll be saving up now
for much better camcorder and no more "I just gotta have this right now"
Save your $, find a quality product - even if you have to pay a little more for it. Trust me, it will be overall better in the long run . .
