I bought this camera because I'm going to Jamaica and I needed a camera, the video camera was a bonus. When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day. 
I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money.
I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera. I would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option
