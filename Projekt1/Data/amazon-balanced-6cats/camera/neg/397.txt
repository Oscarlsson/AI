I have an R717 camera.  I bought the dock too.  Each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical.  HP labels both as an R07 battery but the L1812A has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera.  The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera. I bought a "clone" battery (not HP) and its edges are rounded too.  Maybe HP could explain the difference.  Just thought you would like to know
