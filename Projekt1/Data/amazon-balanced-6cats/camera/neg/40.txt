I bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. You truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. I took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a Digital Rebel XT). Incredibly soft. Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses:
Canon 10-22mm
Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version)
Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it. 

The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too. 

You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens.
