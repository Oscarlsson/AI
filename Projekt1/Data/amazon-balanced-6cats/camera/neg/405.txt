I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product
