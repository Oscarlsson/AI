I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera. 

The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.

I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail. I certainly don't like everything going soft.
