I love everything about this camera BUT....The display is very touchy. I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke. I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right. My display shattered. Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of. This is NOT covered under your warranty. My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. So I am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures. I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it!
