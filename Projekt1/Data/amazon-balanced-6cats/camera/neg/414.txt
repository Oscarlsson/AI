I ordered a case for my Kodak DX6490 digital camera from ANTONLINE thru AMAZON but received a case that is inches too small for my camera.  If the numbers referenced above show in the review, you can see that my model of camera does not appear.  In spite of this ANTOLINE has refused to issue an RMA for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if I return without their RMA. They tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened.  The only packaging was a brown padded envelope.  Is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it? I guess I could go to the airport and put it through the screener.

There is a little tag on the case that reads DX6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height, depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice. When I checked Kodak online, the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions.

Amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either. At this point I would never patronize ANTOLINE again
