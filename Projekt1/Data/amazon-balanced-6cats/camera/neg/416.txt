This was a TERRIBLE purchase on my part.  It doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky.  The bag was too small for my z7590, and I paid $8 shipping PLUS return shipping.  I only hope they don't charge me a re-stocking fee. I went to WalMart, found a cute little bag in the electronics dept. that the camera fits great in, with room for the strap AND extra memory cards or battery if necessary.  They have cute ones for ladies too, with pink polka dots or stripes inside!  For only $12.  Next time, I'll be smarter!
