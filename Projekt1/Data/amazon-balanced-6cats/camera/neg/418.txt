Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it.  Two years later my feelings are very different.  Batteries need to be recharged constantly.  Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.  All I can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying.  Zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated.  Flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly "white" looking because of this.  Definitely going with Canon on my next purchase
