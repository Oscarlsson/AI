I too, loved the camera, despite the small LCD screen size, until it got the infamous White Screen of Death that this particular camera is known for, which usually occurs AFTER the warranty expires (1 year).  Photos outside are great, poor low-light photos though, but I paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80).  Small LCD screen means that it takes less battery power, so the rechargeable AA batteries lasted a long time.  

White screen of death temporary solution:  Turn the camera off, and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the "Cybershot" logo on the front of the camera.  Then turn it back on.  Repeat if necessary.  It'll probably happen again, but it beats buying a brand new camera if you're on vacation and don't have time to bargain shop
