"You get what you pay for"

Most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  The Philips DVP642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  This is not.

I was hoping the same of this product from all the "glowing" reviews on here.  However, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  First of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  For myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    However, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  This monopod doesn't even come close.

Here are it's bad points:

-The aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  The leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  It feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.

-The head is very cheap and not solid.  No matter how tight I tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  The workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the PLASTIC tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  I think we've all experienced that in the past.

-The leg locks are not tight.  When you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.

In the end, it was a risk I took hoping that I could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  Sometimes, you can get away with that.  Walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  In this case, I should've bought a REAL monopod.  Oh well, I wasted $16 that I could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod
