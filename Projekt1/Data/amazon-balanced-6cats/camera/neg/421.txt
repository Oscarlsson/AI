The Cybershot DSCS40 was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter in 2005.  A few days after Christmas 2006, the camera ceased functioning.  Because the camera was shipped in November 2005, Sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as $111.  Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another Sony product in the future
