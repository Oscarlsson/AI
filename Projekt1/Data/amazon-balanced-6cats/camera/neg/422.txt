I loved my 4.1mp Sony Cypershot I got for Christmas in 2005. Then a few days after Christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it. If I would tap the camera they would go away. But then a few days later I was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working. It would turn on but then shut off. I had this problem before with low batteries but I changed them and it still didn't work. It would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out. So many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use. SO SAD CAMERA DEA
