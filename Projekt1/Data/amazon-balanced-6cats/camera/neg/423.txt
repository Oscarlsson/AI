Ok, this camera was inexpensive so I bought it for my kid for Christmas (2005).  It actually took better pictures than my other camera (other model Sony Cyber-Shot), so I didn't give it to my kid, I kept it.  I bought it a few weeks before Christmas, it was opened and used on Christmas day. I just used it days ago, and it just did the thing where it starts turning on, then immediately shuts off.  It has been less than 1 year of use, but a week over 1 year from purchase.  Sony wants to charge me $111 and change, to fix it (The camera was less than that when I bought it).  I was just using the camera and it just shut off!  I searched inet to find MANY other people experience same issue.  THIS CAMERA IS DISPOSABLE!!!!  I took my extra 256mb chip out of it to put in my other Sony camera, and my wife said you can't see the screen (lcd screen) and you couldn't for a long time.  The other camera has the same issue MANY other people complain of as well.  I also have 2 different model Sony DVD writers for computer which are malfunctioning, and a Sony Vega 36" TV which isn't worth the money. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SONY PRODUCT AGAIN!
