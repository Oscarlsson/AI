As the previous reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the KLIC-5001 1700 mAh battery as described in the Product Details, it is the lower capacity (1050 mAh) KLIC-5000. 

At least it is the Kodak battery, if that matters to you. (I have a new Kodak camera and want to protect the warranty.)  If not, plenty of places sell the generic KLIC-5001 for less than Amazon sells the Kodak KLIC-5000
