I purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine. When I saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images, I was embarassed that I had given such an inferior item as a gift.  Perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution, but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels.

I would not recommend this item at all
