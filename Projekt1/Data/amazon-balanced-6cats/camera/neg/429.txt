It's only redeemingly quality is the price (if you get a good deal). Photo quality is poor, and screen is quite small (3x5). Navigation is not overly complicated, but buttons must be pushed hard to work. It did work perfectly fine - took SD card, even connected to my Mac and drag and drop photos onto the SD card I inserted into the frame. But, because of the poor quality of the photos, I don't suggest buying
