i got to get it off my chest.  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.  BUT, the camera has several down sides:   1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.  this is a pain.  2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.   3. not durable.  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.  any suggestions???
