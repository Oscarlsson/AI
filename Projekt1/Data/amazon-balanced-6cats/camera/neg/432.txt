I'm sure that if the camera worked properly, it would have been fantastic; however, I received a camera on my birthday this year, only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism.  I took 4 blurry shots of my son's birthday party, and the next time I turned the camera on, the LCD screen was broken.  We purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy, so when I brought the camera (10 days old, mind you) in for repair, they insisted that I'd dropped it and broken it (which I hadn't), even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches, dents or anything.  After sending it in, Best Buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix, and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until I'd paid for the LCD screen to be fixed.  Disgusted, I retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed.  I contacted Sony, who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair.  I ended up receiving a call from their repair center, informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that LCD screens are not covered, whether I received it broken or not.  I tried a third time for repair, only to be told that I would have to pay.  My mother tried to use her Buyer's Protection Plan from her Visa (it was a birthday gift from her to me), only to have her money refunded, then re-charged months later when Best Buy's legal department wouldn't pay her Visa bill.
Based upon our experiences (among other bad experiences with Best Buy), we stopped shopping at Best Buy, and now own a lovely Olympus camera.  Don't buy the Sony Cybershot DSC-T9
