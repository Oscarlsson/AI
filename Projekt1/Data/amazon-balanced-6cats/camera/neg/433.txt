Just bought a SONY T9 in Tokyo last April 10,2006 (7 months ago).
And suddenly 2 weeks ago, the screen went dim practically can not see anything.

The power on / off also not working. All happened at the same time.
Try to repair at SONY service station in Shanghai as I am residing there for the moment.

Very indifferent customer service staff refuse to repair, despite that I do have a world wide guarantee card and the receipt from the Tokyo shop as well as the complete boxes.

The SONY people there are really not helpful at all.

Most probably we suspect, they don't want to shoulder the cost for repairing under guarantee from SONY worldwide.
It is shameful for such a big name like SONY.

Definitely, I will not buy again from SONY. Change to Olympus for the replacement and also cancel my BRAVIA LCD purchase.

I do not recommend buying goods from SONY as you  might have the same experiences (poor hardware quality and services)
