I was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. It's lightweight but sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, and very adjustable. I used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted, like a short tripod, and it was wonderful. It's also nicely finished, and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs, it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it. 

Unfortunately, that evening I had trouble docking our new Sony camcorder, and when I looked at the bottom of the camcorder, I saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera! To my great relief, I was able to pull out the pin with no trouble, but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes. I was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod, so this is not "consumer error." (I can't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then I can't dock the camcorder... bad on Sony there...but still.) 

Your mileage may vary, but this tripod is going back to Amazon, and I'll be shopping for another brand.
