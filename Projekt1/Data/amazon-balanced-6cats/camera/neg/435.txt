I bought this camcorder 3 months ago and, after using it a grand total of 6 times, it is broken.  It constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes (two minutes on the counter in the display), refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full.  It's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes???  I figured that was a problem with the tape so I tried another one, which seemed to work fine until I got home and tried to watch the footage.  The camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up.  I had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where I needed it to be.  Lastly, the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month.     

One last note, the support for Panasonic is horrible too.  You can't talk to a "real" person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization "person".  I'll never buy another Panasonic product again...give me Sony
