Cheaply made and ill-fitting, this "deluxe" case isn't worth half the price.  There is no handle or wrist strap provided; your camera's strap becomes the carry handle.  A small, snap-strap is provided, but I can't figure out what it's for... the snap is easily unfastened with light pressure, and I wouldn't trust it to hold the weight of the empty case, much less with the heft of a camera inside.  Don't buy this item:  Amazon will not reimburse you for the return postage, because it's not their fault you don't like it... and you WILL be returning it.  Save yourself the trouble.
