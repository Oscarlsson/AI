The default supplier for this item is Adorama.  They have sku numbers mixed up on the back end, so they will ship you the HP 6221 dock instead.  Will not work with the R series.
They do not even carry the actual HP 8887 dock.  
Huge hassles, so click on the new and used link and buy directly from Amazon.  It's a few dollars more, but at least you get the right item
