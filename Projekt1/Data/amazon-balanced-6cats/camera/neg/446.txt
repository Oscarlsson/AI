I purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my R818 camera (the dock has a thin port, roughly 10 connectors) while the R818 has a mini USB plug).

HP was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter, getting a different answer each time I spoke to a different rep (even being told at one point that no supervisors were working).  I was finally able to get someone willing to send me one, but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it, which by then I'll be on vacation (and I purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter, thinking it was not hard to get).  I was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation.

I would definately *not* recommend this if you have the Photosmart R818 digital camera, unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get a correct part, and waiting 10+ business days to get it
