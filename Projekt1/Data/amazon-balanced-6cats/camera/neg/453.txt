I purchased this camera from Amazon recently.  The FIRST time around, the camera tape door wouldn't shut the very first time I opened it.  I returned the camera and Amazon was great about replcing it promptly.  The SECOND time around, the DV port worked once, and ONLY once.  There's a short in it.  There is a REASON this camera is so cheap.  It's J U N K!!  I will add that a friend of mine is on her second JVC as well.  A fact I did not know until all of this came about.  

For two stars, I'll say the video quality is good.  The camera battery does hold a full 60 min. charge.  I had NO sound issues what so ever.  Background noise?? none here.
As for still pictures, if you don't know what you're doing as far as shutter speeds, back light, etc. FORGET IT.  The still pictures are very grainy.  If you want professional looking stills, do NOT buy a camcorder for this purpose.

JVC tech support is USELESS.

Camcorder comes with a USB wire to upload still only.  As on ANY digital camcorders, you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port.  You need a firewire.  This does not come with one.  Also, you need to check if you HAVE a firewire port on your computer.

I paid app. $25 dollars here on Amazon including shipping, for a port and firewire.  It took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower.  It's no big deal.

Amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time, only refund my money.  This camera is now listed as $30 cheaper than when I bought it last month.  

Overall, AMAZON was great about service and return, however, this particular JVC item is JUNK
