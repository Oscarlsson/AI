I received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it, I ran into an error message: "Unit in safeguard mode - remove & reattach battery."  I did what I was told.  Several times.  Same message.  Argh!  (to my husband's chagrin, I read the user's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem...why is this happening to me?!)  I searched the web looking for a solution, but all I found were perhaps hundreds of people with the SAME message on similar JVC model camcorders, rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from JVC once their warranty ran out.  Luckily I ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product.

Sure, you might not believe me when I suggest to stay clear of this model.  I'm constantly disregarding Amazon reviews that preach "do not buy this product!", etc.  That's why I'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you're still convinced you want it.  Suggested search on Google: "jvc camcorder safeguard mode error".
