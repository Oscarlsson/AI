Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! 

With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.

WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!!
