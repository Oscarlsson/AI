Bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video.  Spoke with JVC and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in.  Will update my rating after I see what is wrong, if they can fix it, if they will stand behind their product.  Watch for more details.  Before it failed only complaint I had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price
