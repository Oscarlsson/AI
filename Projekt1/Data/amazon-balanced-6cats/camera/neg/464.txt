This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:

1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  

2.  The mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  The earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  A better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.  

3.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  

4.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "shiver", which is very frustrating.  

Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.
