I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to "radio control" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized. 

If you need a "cable release," I strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. It gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time.
