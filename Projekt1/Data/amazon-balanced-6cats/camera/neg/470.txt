Have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid.  Instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and  error.  After getting best possible settings, main problem is still picture quality: using high quality jpg files as input, photos display with about the visual sharpness of the Sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance.  Not at all like what I have seen in other digital picture frames.  Just arrived from Amazon and intended as a V-Day gift (tomorrow) for my wife, big disappointment, guess I better make a dash to the florist.
