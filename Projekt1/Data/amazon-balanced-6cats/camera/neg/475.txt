I owned this Sony for a single day before I returned it to Amazon.  First off, it records in MPEG2 format which is fairly compressed, and looks it once you upload to your computer.  It is also not natively supported on the Mac without a 20$ additional Quicktime MPEG2 plugin.  Which has to be converted before editing. Which makes it a slow, tedious affair.  Also, the included software is, surprise, PC only.  
  Other problems, not computer related - the Chroma shift in "night mode" is intense, making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly.  I'm not expectant of miracles in night modes, but it seems like a simple solution on the production side(Sony).  The auto white balance could also use the same attention.

  Like the previous reviewer pointed out, not a bad camera for the money if you're not serious about editing and you're using a PC.  The LCD touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use.  All in all, I would go for a Canon
