I bought this camera in about February 2005 but didn't know enought about digital to know what I can actually get.  Goes through batteries pretty fast.  The recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot.  Takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture.  I just thought this was normal for digital cameras till I began reading later reviews.  Then I accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface (loose dirt and sawdust)and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on.  Contacted HP to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one.  So I am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a Canon or Sony or something besides an HP
