Normally I wouldnt write a review, but I have had numerous experiences with this camera that I thought I would share.

My sister first bought the camera, and I was amazed with how user friendly it was and I thought the pictures turned out pretty well.  Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage.

Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck.  I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work.

And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken.

I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.  But three times? I dont find this to be a coincidence, and I do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months
