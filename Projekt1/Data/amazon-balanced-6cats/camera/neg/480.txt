I have owned this joke of a camera for over a year now, so as someone with alot of experience with it, I advise you NOT TO BUY ONE.  I wouldn't reccomend this camera if it was only $19.95 and came with a free sledgehammer to take your anger out on it when you realize you just wasted twenty bucks...

- Without buying a memory card, this camera holds a pathetic number of pictures at any setting above VGA.
- Non HP memory cards are incompatible.
- It EATS UP batteries, seriously.
- It shuts off without warning for no reason whatsoever.
- It will often not recognize rechargable batteries as being rechargable.

At this point, I am shopping for a new camera because my M407 claims that brand new batteries are "depleted" and shuts off, lovely
