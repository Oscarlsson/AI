I ordered the Sony DCR-DVD108 on April 9.  I still haven't received the camera.  What I have received are 2 e-mails stating that the product is late without any sort explanation why.  As far as I'm concerned it is too late!  The first stated that the shipment would leave on April 16.  When I purchase the camera, I did so because the add stated that if I wanted the camera by April 12, I needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes.  This I did.  The next e-mail that arrived just this morning and I've been informed that it will arrive between April 26 and May 3.   I have already missed recording one of my seven year old daughter's gymnastics competitions and now if stick with their delivery dates, I'll be missing 2 more.  Well, I'm not missing 2 more and Amazon is getting the camera back. The best part of this is that I don't even have the option of canceling the order because Amazon is and I quote, "... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order cannot be canceled or changed."  If you can't get the order out on time, you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet, try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost.  I can tell you with certainty that sort of customer service would bring your customers for life.
