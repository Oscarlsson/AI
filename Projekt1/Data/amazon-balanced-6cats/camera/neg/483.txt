bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page, so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality.  but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one.  in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on, and in good lighting it is barely adequate.  wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card...should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer.  you get what you pay for
