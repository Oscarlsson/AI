I ordered the original item, used it for about a week, then sent it to my son in New Hampshire.  He used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up, never to function properly again.  I ordered a replacement, checked it out and sent it on to him, with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use, it quit working.
I thought the unit was nice, compact and fairly easy to use, but with two malfunctions in two cameras, I don't think I would recommend this Aiptek model to anyone
