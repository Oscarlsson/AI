Hi, I bought this camera and installed the driver from both the CD and then the web.  It caused my computer (a good, modern, fast computer) to crash both times.  The camera worked without interfacing with the computer, but, then, what's the point?  Also, the pictures and movies were VERY grainy and low quality.  The tech support when I had these problems was HORRIBLE.  They really didn't stand behind the product AT ALL and to me that's the most important thing!  Maybe I could have gotten it to work, but not without SOME input from Aiptek.  
I've never written one of these reviews before, but this really got to me.  Don't buy this camera is my advice.
