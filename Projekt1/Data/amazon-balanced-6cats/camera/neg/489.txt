I bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. I have to say, I am greatly dissatisfied. Here are some main issues I am having with the camera:

1. It is very poorly designed. The look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. Buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..

2. The camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.

3. The worst, by far, is the picture quality. Colors are just plain terrible. Automatic settings are a disaster of photography. I have used a Canon (2MP) before getting this one (5MP). The Canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. I don't need large files of trash, I am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.

As a result, I am strongly recommending getting a different camera. I have had great experiences with Canon; and seems like Sony and Nikon are doind a good job too. But HP must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices.
