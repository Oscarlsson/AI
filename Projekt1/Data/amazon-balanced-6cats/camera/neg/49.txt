You got to have extremely steady hand, or camera stand to use this camaera.

During my niece wedding, I put in a 2GB of memory and we were trigger happy, we must have took over couple hundred of pictures, however, I am very unhappy about the result. 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy, messy, out of focus.

On the other hand, for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand, you got a great picture.

Size is good, weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size, but to some people that's good quality
