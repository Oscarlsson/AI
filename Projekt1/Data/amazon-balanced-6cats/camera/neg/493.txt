Thought I'd died and gone to heaven; this lens was everything I wanted and more.  Three weeks after receiving it we went to the Grand Canyon, and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus - now it does a focus dance, clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus.  It's not my D70, which still works wth other lenses.  This one's going back to it's maker!  If they fix it, I'll revise this review
