I've purchased seven items from Amazon in 2005, so I'm not a complete rookie. This item's ad title includes the word "Battery" in big, bold letters . I purchased this kit advertised with a "Used Price", but "Condition: New". The ad picture clearly shows a battery. I had looked at several ads and did not read the individual Seller's comment "BATTERY MISSING" in uppercase, though in regular font. To me, a missing part warrants more of a warning than a "comment". That's my "lesson learned", but I still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big, bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing. LESSON LEARNED: READ THE WHOLE AD FOR THE SPECIFIC SELLER, ESPECIALLY THE "Seller's comments"
