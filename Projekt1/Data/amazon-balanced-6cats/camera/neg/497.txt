The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product.  I placed this order more than 30 days ago.  Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R.  If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping
