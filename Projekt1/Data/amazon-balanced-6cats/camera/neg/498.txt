This camera looks cool. But it's so, so not cool.

The people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves. This is by far one of the worst products I have ever purchased. EVER.

By the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place. It "clips" on... but not for long. The camera's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow. It's complelety unreadable. Even with a 150mb card I could only take a few short quality videos. You can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings. And I'm talkin' LOW quality. Worse than any video you've seen online.

More problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it. The controls and interface are not intuitive. You'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep. Oh, and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are HUUUUGE. They aren't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short. I had the camera in my pocket and when I stood erect, the earphones were violently yanked from my ears. They're obviously intended for Oompa-Loompas.

I'm sure I could have found more problems with this thing, but it eventually died on me for no reason.

Don't waste your time with this. You will be sorely disappointed. In fact, if I could give this product a rating of-10 stars I would do so. I'm so extremely disappointed with this camera
