Like another reviewer's, my experience has been mixed. I use this remote with the D50. 

Sometimes the remote works, then it goes on strike. Then suddenly it works again. Same distance and angle from the camera. 

I changed the battery - same result. I hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable
