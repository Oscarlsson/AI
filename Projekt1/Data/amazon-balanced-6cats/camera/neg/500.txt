Received the DXG-506V yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount. Many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam. This is kind of like false advertising. This is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices (like the optimus that radio shack sells) and there is also no image stabilization. Geez, how hard would it have been to put a simple ¼ inch plastic mount on the bottom. As for sound, the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting. You can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting. That is pretty bad. The resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970's cassette tape recorder.

The best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in AVI, MOV or ASX format at different resolutions which is why I got it in the first place. It is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical. It also has a lens cap. 

My advice to DXG is this. 
1.	Add a tripod mount.
2.	Move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that I can use an external microphone. That would be sweet.
3.	Improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations. The optional settings do nothing to improve this. I tried them all.

Bottom line is that I would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount. There are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use.
