They have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since I bought my last Sony handicam in 8/2003.  First of all, there is no carrying strap.  This is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  I managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. The docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. This messes up my editing program.  Fortunately I still have my old camera.  The ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge. 

While I was told most people prefer to use the LED screen (I don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) I like to use the viewfinder.  It no longer has a tilt up feature so I end up mashing the battery into my cheek.

This last complaint is about the batteries. Sony LIED about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  The 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. That's slightly more than 3 hours; It is nowhere near 5 hours.  The 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. Their packages should be accurate.   All in all, It is not as good as the older product.  There also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   THIS WILL BE MY LAST SONY UNLESS THEY MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
