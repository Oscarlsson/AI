For quite sometime lured by media publicity I thought Sony a good brand. But this was not at all true for digital cameras. I bought this P73 for myself and an HP 4 MP camera for my cousin much cheaper than Sony. Both 3x Optical zoom. The HP one was far better in image quality. Main problem is that photo quality is not so good. It lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. This fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a Cannon or an HP camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. Also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands. Also during video, every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off, another irritating fact.
