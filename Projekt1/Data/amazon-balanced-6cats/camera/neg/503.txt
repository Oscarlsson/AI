I had a Kodak camera for years that I absolutely loved.  We took it ice skating and ended up falling on it.  Therefore, my family bought me this Sony for my b-day and I have to say this is the worst camera I have ever owned.  If you have any movement (such as action shots or small children) the picture always comes out blurry.  What a pain!  Also, the picture quality is horrible.  I will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a Kodak
