This is the worst camera I have ever owned in my life. I had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one! I have taken this camera on 2 vacations now, and both times I brought along my Olympus SLR film camera, and both times, the Olympus pictures are clearer, brighter and all but maybe 1 will work, with this stupid Sony Cybershot, I end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening, the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time, or in bright lighting. On the first vacation I went on with this camera, my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures, as did my Olympus, on the second vacation I returned from today as I write this, I just downloaded my pictures, and deleted 2/3's of them because they are so bad, the ones that came off my film camera are perfect! My sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her, and as I went through her pictures, same thing over 2/3's of them didn't work, I would have just assumed I'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my Sony that did not work, however hers didn't either, I would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem, however, I took a number of the exact same picture on this Sony as well as my Olympus (as a back up and thank god I did) and the pictures from the Olympus, as well as every other camera I have ever used, have come out fantastic, on this camera though, they come out horrible, so bad in fact that I'm embarrassed to show people! Believe me, if I hadn't gotten it free as a present I'd be writing a nasty letter to Sony, as it is though my next camera I'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment, therefore knows what they're doing. Sony makes great TV's and home entertainment systems, anything else I've bought from them, or known someone who has, has been junk, their camera, their car stereos, their computers! Sony should stick to TV's and Home Theater, it's what they're good at, camera's not so much, unless you're looking for something cheap that you'd only use in the day, even then I'd recommend a disposable, they even work better than this camera
