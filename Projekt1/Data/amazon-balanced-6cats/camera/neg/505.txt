we had this camera for about a year until on Thanksgiving Day while out of town it broke.  The lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera.  We ran out to Best Buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad.  (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.)  At first we liked the camera and it took good pictures.  They look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up, super cheap too) and the quality was good.  Within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap.  Evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems.  Inside or outside.  I am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i KNOW one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it.  Also the flash quality is horrible.  It takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really, just not a person) it comes out pitch black.  Inside the lighting is bad too. The camera can never focus and it's just annoying. I also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by Sony that for no reason just broke.  One of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing.  The people said there was no way it was their machine, that it had to be a default in the memory stick.  Also the camera is pretty big and clunky.  At the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market, now it is huge!  I am looking into now buying the Canon powershot 6.
