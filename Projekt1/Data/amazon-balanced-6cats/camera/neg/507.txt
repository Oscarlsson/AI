Bought the Samsung 363 from Amazon and it developed mechanical fault while I was test running. Making strange noise after loading the tape making it unuseable.
About 2 weeks later, i decided to show it to a friend in case it was something unserious and then i realised again that it was not even coming up again. Problem with the power system. paralysing it completely (all in less than 3 wks from purchase. Left it Plugged to charge for 2 days without difference

It's indeed a sad story. That would be my last time of buying a tape camcorder.
