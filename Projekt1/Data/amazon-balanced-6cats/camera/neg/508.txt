I bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the PC.  It worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the LCD or the viewfinder.  I could see other information on the LCD, such as the date, time, menu, but no image from the screen.  I called Samsung and that is where it is now for repairs.  A check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented.  I did try to install the software that came with the camera, but that did not go to well either.  I will retry when I get a working camera again.
