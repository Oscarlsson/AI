The thing is that it is not a very stable camera, hence it does not give you very stable shots, so many of your pics will be blured. Even those taken with a tripod. I am a pro photographer, and I would not recommend this camera. Yes, it's very thin, but is not worth the pics it takes...Seek for other model not so tiny if you're expecting better images
