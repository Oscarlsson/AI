We bought this camera two years ago.  We have loved using it, until last week.  The camera showed an "E18" error in the middle of a special event.  We researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error, from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on.  We're not sure how ours developed the E18 (never dropped or damaged.) Our camera has been rendered useless and Canon's only response it to have us mail it in for $100 repair
