Please buy a different camera.  I have owned 5 different pocket digital cameras.  Under normal wear and tear, the Cannon SD400's LCD screen broke where other cameras I've owned have not.  I just purchased the Nikon S7c with a bigger screen that is so well protected that I can hit it with no adverse affect.  If you do buy the SD400, set aside the $150 you'll likely need to replace the LCD
