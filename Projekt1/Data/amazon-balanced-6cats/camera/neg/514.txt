I got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message. I now find out that was a design flaw. Anyway, i spent hundreds of dollars on this one, and now, just over a year after I got it, it won't hold a battery charge. I loved both cameras while they worked, but I can't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so. I've written to Canon tech support. Unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge, I'm moving on to another brand camera
