I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused. 

Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die.

Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me
