Add another E18 error code complaint to the list!  I purchased the camera about a year ago, and have had the E18 error for about the last 2 months.  The camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all, just beep at you and give you an error code E18.  I've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist.  Nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots.  Canon wants nothing to do with the fix, and estimates repairs between $150 and $200.  Save the headaches, and buy another camera from a different manufacturer!
