Here's one more A95 to add to the ever increasing list of E18 failures.
Thanks to the horror stories from the other posters I'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired. The camera is only about 2 years old... guess I'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits!
The camera really performed nicely when it was working... thus the 2 stars. Hope you have better luck than me if you get one
