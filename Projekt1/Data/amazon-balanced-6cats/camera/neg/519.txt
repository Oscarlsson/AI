I got the dreaded "E18" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year.  Repairs will be at least $100, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS...even if the exact same problem occurs again!  This is clearly a design flaw (just read how many users had the same problem).  My first PhotoShot broke after about a year and a half, and since I liked the ease of use and basic design, I chalked it up to bad luck and bought another.  Big mistake
