I purchased this set, and upon arrival, I found the circular polarizer to be defective.  Amazon quickly replaced the set, and this polarizer did not work either!  I returned the set, as I am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works.  I'll pay more, and get a quality product from a different maker.  I will say that Amazon is second to nobody for customer service.  I appreciate that, and will continue to be an Amazon customer.  However, I can't say the same for Tiffen.
