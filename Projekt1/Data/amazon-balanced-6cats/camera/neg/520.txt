I bought my Canon A95 in November 2004.  A little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous E18 error struck.  I called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling.  I bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it.  For all I know, it might break down again after the repair! The repair comes with 90-Day warranty period, but it COULD break again after 90 days.  

And then... 
There is an upgrade option.  Canon offers a program where you can upgrade A95 for A610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling.  This comes with only 6-month warranty.  Again, it COULD be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.  

I would really do extensive research before buying another CANON.
