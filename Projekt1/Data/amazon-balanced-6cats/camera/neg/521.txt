I've had this camera just over a year (figures) and it has gone completely bonkers on me.  Sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless.  You never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not -- making it completely unreliable.  Keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business, so it wasn't abused, dropped, thrown in the bottom of a purse, etc.  It was treated very carefully and probably only shot about 2,000 pictures total.

Frankly, I'm kind of glad it broke so that I have an excuse to replace it.  Here's why:

1.  Takes beautiful still shots, but forget about any kind of action.  It takes too long between shots to get good action.  It also blurs nearly all the action shots I've ever taken, regardless of what mode it's in.

2.  The red-eye is aweful.  It should do better.

I doubt that I'll ever buy another Canon
