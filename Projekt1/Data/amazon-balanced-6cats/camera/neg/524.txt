I thought my JVC Digital Camera was handy, easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was... then one day at my daughter's ballet show, I turned it on (I made sure I charged it all night) and it wouldn't record.  It kept saying that the lens cap was on.  I am so frustrated and sad.  I spent a good chunk of money on this item and don't know what happened... still don't have a way of recording my daughter's milestones.... 

Don't buy it, if you have other options.
