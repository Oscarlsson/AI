I've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months.  My regular camera is a Fuji Finepix S602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots.  I tried the Casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and I'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps I've had that resulted in poor facial quality.  Don't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like.  

I've just ordered the PowerShot SD1000 because of the facial detection feature on it.  Hopefully, it is better since I don't want to have to carry my bulky Fuji to get great facial photos.  I'll review the Cannon  once I've had it for a few months
