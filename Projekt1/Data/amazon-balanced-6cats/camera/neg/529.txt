This camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box.  One mistake I made was to not take my own SD card to the camera shop and look at the output.  I thought the blurry image I was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera.  I've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this.
Casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work.  And point and shoot is definately not an option.  I thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping.  I've taken over 200 pictures and I will not print any of them.
