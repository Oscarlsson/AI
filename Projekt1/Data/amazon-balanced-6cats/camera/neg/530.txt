I own several great digital cameras. It seems like I get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. This one I wanted for the high MP in a small compact size that I can put into my pocket. The first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out. When I download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. I've played around with the settings (and I do know how to work them) but still it does the same.
So time to return to find a better one. That's too bad since I read some good reviews and wanted to have it
