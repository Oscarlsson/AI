The IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format, not MPEG-4.  I bought one from 'egghead.com'.  After 30 days, I contacted Aiptek to tell them the problem, they acknowledged that the IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format.  They said there is nothing they will do about it.  Do not buy this product.  Aiptek advertises that the IS-DV records video in MPEG-4 format, but it doesn't.  'Egghead.com' won't deal with me because they say I should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date
