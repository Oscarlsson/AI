the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture. Compared to other digital camera's this has presented a problem for the two users I purchased these camera's for. 

Also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet. the pictures are too hot, over exposed and no adjustment works properly.
