I have one word for the Argus Quick Clix, Horrible. I bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for Christmas. The camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them. I was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use. This camera takes horrible pictures. All of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy. When the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject. One very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off. There is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash. You have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use. As stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture, it is so bright that the picture is useless. I would not recommend this camera to anyone
