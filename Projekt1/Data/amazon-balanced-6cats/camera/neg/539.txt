What a pile of junk.  Three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture.  If you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess.  Even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark.  And if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing.  I can't believe they sell this thing.
