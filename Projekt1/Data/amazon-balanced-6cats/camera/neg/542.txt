SD card worked fine for a week.
Problems arise then worsens over time for one more week then it just doesn't work anymore.  
Problem is not the PDA, nor software on it.  Tried to use the card on a separate flash reader/writer.  Tried formatting it to FAT32, create test directory, data stays on for less than one hour. 
I would refrain from buying this product.
