I've never ordered anything and been this disappointed.  I ordered two of these and both didn't work.  I contacted the company's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it.  I tried contacting Ritz Camera where I purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund.  I am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support.  I will never buy another product from this company again.
