My wife got this for me for Christmas.  I was thrilled and thought it was a great idea.  I charged the device and transferred pictures to it.  I work in technology, so I agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible -- to delete any photos, you have to delete them from the device, not the software.  Image quality is OK, but not good enough to be "sharing" with people.  And after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them, it got a bit old.

Other than looking at it "straight-on", nobody on either side of you can see the image.  It's back-lit, which is fine...but it doesn't help much.

Unfortunately, the battery didn't last all that long.  The device refused to charge after about two months, and eventually it died altogether.  The only way to make the unit work was to plug in the USB cable; the battery would not charge. So I contacted "support" and got a basic run-around, telling me that you "shouldn't charge the battery for more than 2-3 hours" at a time, and that I could request an RMA to return it for replacement.  Warranty is no good, and it can't be returned.

I'm holding onto it because I'll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop "photocube", so it can run off the USB cable.

But I agree with others that -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it's just a novelty that gets tedious quickly
