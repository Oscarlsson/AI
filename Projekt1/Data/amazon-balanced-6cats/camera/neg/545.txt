This keychain photo viewer sold by a company called "Smartparts" is identical to one sold by "Argus."  Neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support.  You buy this, you're on your own.  You seem to be able to find the Argus one a little cheaper... though they do mar the front of it with a big, black imprint of their logo.

In any case, this thing is maybe worth $20 as a novelty.  Don't pay more.  Image quality is mediocre and the software, while functional, is stunningly primitive.  If you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations, it's a kind of cute gizmo.  But don't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy.  Check the bargain bins for this thing, or just wait for the next generation device.
