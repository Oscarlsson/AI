I purchased this for my wife for Valentine's Day. The installation went fine but I have two problems with the device. First, the software to do the picture transfers is awful. You can only select pictures on your computer to download - you can't see what photos are on the device in the software. In order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself. I checked the webpage for updated software - no joy. The crop feature is nice (and well used) but otherwise I feel like I am looking at a Windows 3.1 application. Second, the image quality on the device is very poor. I didn't have very high expectations, but this was lower than I expected. Reminds me of the picture/screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens, maybe a bit worse. You can make out the picture, but not much detail at all. The advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea, it's the only way to get a decent picture.

Overall, I'm a little disapointed. But then, you get what you pay for..
