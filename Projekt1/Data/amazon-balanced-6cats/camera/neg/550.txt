DOWNSIDE: 
1. I'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem. The camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems. I switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work. On top of that I now have a memory card with photos on it that I can't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that.
2. Not good with indoors pictures ESPECIALLY if you try the "night" mode. If you use that mode, even with a tripod, keep your subjects to still-lifes, only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest, they will at best be blurry, at worst they will look like double exposures.
3. Indoors pictures set at normal mode, with or without flash, are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera.

UPSIDE:
1. Through its USB cable, it booted right into Apple's iPhoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that I took a breeze.
2. Outdoors, with plenty of sunlight, gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise. Kodak did well with this aspect of the camera's ability, given the price.
3. We won this camera (free) so for me it's almost all upside...except now I have to shell out $$$ for a good camera (that will hopefully read my current memory card
