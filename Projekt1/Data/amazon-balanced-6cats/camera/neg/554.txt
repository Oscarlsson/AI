I gave it two stars because it was great... when it worked.
I got it sometime in January, and it lasted until about June.
I take good care of my things, so I know its not me.
It just suddenly *stopped* working.
I'm more than just a little miffed.
I've tried getting all different types of batteries-
I've tried letting it sit for a while.
I've taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff.
Its dead. I just threw it away
