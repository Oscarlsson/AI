I'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures.  The P3 was the fourth point and shoot Nikon camera my family has owned.  One of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  On the P3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  I accidently dropped it from about 30" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  It landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  The outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. I sent it back to Nikon and as I expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  They charged $162.50 to fix it.  MasterCard has a program called "Purchase Assurance" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!  

The other night I saw a commercial on TV for an Olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet, get wet, or even frozen down to 14 degrees F and still take pictures.  I wish I had seen that ad first.  
The Nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera.  Not buying Nikon anymore.
