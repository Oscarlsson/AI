this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and  wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it. 

the good

*it is compact, which is pretty convenient

*it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy. 

the bad

*after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over. 

*the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously.

*the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience.

*the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry. 

*the user manual left me with a lot of questions
