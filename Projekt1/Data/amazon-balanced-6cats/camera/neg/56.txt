The camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  I took it to a Pentax authorized repairer and Pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  My use was in no way abusive.  I had a previous Canon Powershot S200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until I gave it away.  I guess I should have stayed with Canon.  I bought the Pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  Don't get the Pentax and expect long term use out of it
