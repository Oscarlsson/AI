Here is the short version. 

Oct05 
I bought a Fujifilm Finepix F460 digital camera for $299.99. 

Nov06 
Camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating 
bright/dark horizonal strips across them. 

Jan07 
I sent the camera in to Fujifilm's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires. 

Jan07 
The service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 (I spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if I accepted). 

Feb07 
I contacted the service center and stated that I think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse. And that I don't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired. The service rep, named Christina, asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do. I complied. 

Mar07 
Fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that I did not reply to the estimate. 

Now 
I will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera, its memory card, and the shipping I paid.
