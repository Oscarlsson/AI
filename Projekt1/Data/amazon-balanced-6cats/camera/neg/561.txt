The worst thing for this is, you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing HD video. I think most of buyers would take HD video if you buy a HD camcorder. But a small disc can only hold 20 min HD video, have to change disc time by time. The CMOS sensor is worse than CCD but it is the best sensor among CMOS in this price today. A lot of noise will come in low light condition! I bought it for $800 and return it. I think you'd better buy SR1 with a 30G hard drive. That would be a much better one!
