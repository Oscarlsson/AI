We use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations.  The hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations.
To test the microphone.  I went to a Noisy Starbucks, huge lines, moderate music and tons of conversations.  I recorded on the video cameras mics, then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature.  I aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders.  In all instances, there was no difference in sound quality.  
I then went to the Sony Style Store in the Mall and had her open a different Microphone and allowed her to install it. She read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings.  We could not find any difference.  
I checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic.  Once the mic is attached and turned on, the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic.  

I am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera.  Many of the new camcorders with hard drives and DVD drives do not have a MIC input or Active Interface Shoe.  I would rather want a MIC input so that I can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of Sony to create one for their shoe.  

Overall, I am stuck.  If I record something interesting I will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing.  (The camera shots great video
