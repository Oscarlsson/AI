I realize this is not a true gunshot mic though I had hope. The product presents itself as cheap and I hate to say the results are not good quality.  At this time, I'm the only reviewing customer and I can see I must have been the only guy to buy one of these.  

Product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio.  Three settings, zoom (syncs with camcorder's zoom), gun (which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom), and off.  

I purchased this to make recordings of presentations better.  I know now that I should have just bought a wireless mic for the speaker.  I thought I'd get more use this route
