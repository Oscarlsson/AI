Hi,

I have had the VDR-D300 for about 6 months now.  I have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min.  The camcorder constantly locks up, usually after about 10 min.  This is on a full battery - the unit never gets even to a battery alarm.  Several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works.  I must have a faulty unit.  I'm investigating repair.  The unit has a great lens, camera, and video image, but my unit is not stable at all
