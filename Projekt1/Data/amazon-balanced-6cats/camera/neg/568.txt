This product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card.  This little fact isn't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual (hidden from consumer). I initially loaded 1,400 photos onto a 128MB card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed. A firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250, but I could never get the file to load into the frame. Another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music.  It would have been nice to hear a RANDOM music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on. Definitely NOT worth the price. Shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback
