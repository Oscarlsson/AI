-- Update 4/23/2007 - The vendor indicates a new firmware release is due in the 5/2007 - 6/2007 time frame, and it may fix the issue of the limited number of pictures mentioned below. --

Picture quality is fair and adjusting brightness and contrast in the setup yields good results. Appearance of the unit is good and the black and cherry frames are nicely finished, but the red rectangular sensor for the remote below the LCD display mars the effect somewhat.

At 5.6 inches, this size frame is only useful where it can be viewed up close. The images are smaller than a 4x6 print that you would typically view in a book or hold in your hand. I found putting it on a book shelf to be too far away. On an end table next to the chair you would view it from is better. The size of the LCD also should tell you that resolution is not spectacular, true of any frame in this category. 

My biggest problem with this particular unit is that even after updating to the latest firmware (~3/2007), it will only display up to about 250 pictures. I expected that what ever was on the memory card I inserted would be displayed.

Overall this is still a good buy if you do not want to display a large number of photos.  I am very disappointed that the number of displayable pictures is not listed in the manufacturer's product description so you know of the limit before you purchase it
