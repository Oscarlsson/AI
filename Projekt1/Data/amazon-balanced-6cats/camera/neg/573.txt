I bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed.  I sent it into Nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty. The repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22.

I am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused.  Battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time I had it. 

For this reason I would never buy another Nikon product again.  Next digital camera will charge without removing battery.  

Camera takes GREAT pictures, but can't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty. 

Bye Bye Nikon
