I was very disappointed in Nikon's service.  This camera has a 2in LCD display that apparently is very fragile.  When I returned for service, Nikon claimed I dropped it... which I didn't!  I was very careful in handling this camera, but the fragile LCD still broke.  To be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing.  They offered to repair it for $210, nearly the price of a new camera.  

I will NEVER by a Nikon product again.  If they are going to sell such a fragile product, they should at least include a hard case for it.
