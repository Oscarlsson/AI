I won this camera in a contest and now I'm kinda wishing I never had.  Practically everything I've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another.  From the autofocus that can never decide what it wants to focus on, to the very poor image quality in slightly low lighting situations, to the camera recording glitches in the audio when I capture onto my computer.  I know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right, but I really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a Canon camera that's not gonna cause you these problems
