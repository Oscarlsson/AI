The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  

Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  

Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs.

Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
