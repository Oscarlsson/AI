Even though Amazon specifically recommended this bag for the Panasonic Lumix (DMC-FZ20PP) camera, and even though I had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, Amazon annoyingly CONTINUES to recommend this bag for my camera. To add insult to injury, Amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (It took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after I put a LARGE message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)

Regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories
