Bought this as an XMAS present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. I'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/Phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, Sony memory sticks).

The internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.

I've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a PC friendly device, it's certainly not always Mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.

I wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.

Also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - NO SUPPORT for the new, MS ProDuo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)

I thought I would get a quality product from Phillips, and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately, it's turned out to be a piece of junk, one I've been screwing around with for so long that it's probably not returnable.

Don't waste your time and dollars.......................
