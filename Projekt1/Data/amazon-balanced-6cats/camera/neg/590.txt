The quality of the pictures are nice WHEN they will actually print.  Unless you use the printer with your camera ON the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work.  If you decide to crop the picture on your PC and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work!  I have had it for sometime now and I have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing.
