Terrible product.  Printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly.  I've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens.  Even though I have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement, which I have had less than a year, Kodak support says it cannot be fixed by me and I need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks.  A new one sells for $99 and the price is dropping fast.  I told Kodak support I would not send it back to them, spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye. I further notified Kodak that I would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill.

Also, I've heard that the recommended fix (which does not work, by the way), unplugging the unit to reset, will cause the color cartridge light to illuminate prematurely.  With the cost of paper and cartridges, this last insult makes this printer one to avoid.  1 star because when it does print the prints look good, but, man, the aggravation to get this thing to work correctly is not worth any price.  Rushed to the market place without enough reliability testing on an unsuspecting public.  Total junk from a venerable name desperate for a hit product.
