The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.

My 3-year old 5MPX Sony is much better than this Panasonic camera.  I am sorry I bought it. I would return this product if I could and buy a good camera instead.

The Lumix DMC-LX2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  Even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  Noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  You can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.

The Amazon website says you can use standard SD memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  The camera only accepts more expensive SDHC (high capacity) cards.  These SDHC cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so I have to use the USB port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer.
