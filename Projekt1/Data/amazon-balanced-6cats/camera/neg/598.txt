Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they "...won't bother fixing it again..." and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract
