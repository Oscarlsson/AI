I purchased this camera for my own birthday present last October.  I have owned it for 1 year and 2 months and now it isn't working.  I paid $400.00 for it last year when it was "new."  The LCD will only turn on every 15 - 20 times after I take the batteries out and turn the camera on and off. I purchased new rechargeable batteries, but that wasn't the answer.  I contacted Panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period.  They will charge a flat $140.00 to fix it and I can get a new one for about $150.00.  I loved this camera, but it is such a disappointment.  I was very easy with it - it just stopped working!  Buy a different camera - I wish I had
