I bought this in August 2005, when the original battery that came with my Nikon Coolpix 880 (late 2000) started running down fast.  On the page I ordered from, it appeared to be a genuine Nikon battery, however, when I received it, it was not.  It was made in Taiwan, and does not have the Nikon brand name anywhere on the battery (or packaging, as I remember).  This battery has never held a charge well.  It's about as bad as the original battery is now, and I've only had it a few months.  Maybe I just got a lemon--but I'd recommend you buy a genuine Nikon, if you can find one
