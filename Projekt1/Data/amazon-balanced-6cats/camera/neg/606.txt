I bought this camera for myself during Christmas 2004.

It was suppose to be a utility camera, ebay items and class projects for the kids only--I don't trust digital cameras for family photos.

The Kodak CX7300 seemed to fit the bill; inexpensive, easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp.

The flaw in this camera didn't appear until I pulled it out of the drawer some months later. The camera wouldn't turn on. I checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape. I eventually tried replacing the batteries and, sure enough, that worked.

The next time I took out the camera, the exact same thing happened. And the time after that.

At first, I thought the CX7300 was eating the batteries. But eventually I came to the conclusion that the camera doesn't eat batteries, it nibbles at them. It won't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries.

The Kodak batteries that came with the CX7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight, going strong.

I contacted Kodak about this flaw. They wanted to talk about what kind of batteries I'm using--Kodak--or the option of my purchasing a Camera Dock and some rechargeable batteries. A solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent.

I thought that buying an optional AC Adapter would be the simple, and cheap, solution. Surprise, surprise, the CX7300 is one of the few digital cameras Kodak makes that doesn't take one.

So, now that I'm way past warranty, what do I do with it?
