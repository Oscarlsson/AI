My camera has broken in less than one year of owning it.  Because I received it as a gift I don't have the proof of purchase so Kodak will not fix my camera for no cost.  What a lemon the CX7300 is.  First of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture.  What's broken?  I can take one picture before the batteries go dead.  I change the batteries, one picture.  Change the batteries again, one picture
