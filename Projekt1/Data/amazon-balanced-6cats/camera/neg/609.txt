I got this camera when it was rather new. I am not extremely pleased with it. It is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it.
-first of all...it has no lens cover so you HAVE to keep it in a camera bag. Incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined.
-It takes for ever to take a picture. You have to wait for like  2 seconds for the picture to be taken.
-It eats up batteries like crazy
-It takes forever to turn on
-If you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight
-The pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home
-It has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice.
