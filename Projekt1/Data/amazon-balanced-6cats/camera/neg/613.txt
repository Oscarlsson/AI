I am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible. I took about 400 shots with my Digital Rebel XT and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that I immediately returned it / got a refund. 

In all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus. In many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it's entire range. Since most of my photography is of animals I simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots.

I tested the autofocus against my Canon 18-55 EF-s (packaged with the Rebel XT) and a Canon 75-300 EF. In every instance where the Tamron could not focus the Canon lenses had no problem! When the Tamron would focus I found the pictures were not as sharp as my Canon lenses. Again I'm far from an expert however I was only printing 4x6 photos.

I replaced the Tamron with a Quantaray(Sigma) 55-200 DC which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality(for amatuers..) 

Bottom line.. It was hard to part with the Tamron because I was really enthused about the zoom range however I would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that doesn't. I have read many reviews with the same problem noted. Tamron needs to get thier act together
