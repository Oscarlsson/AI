I originally purchased the Samsung DUOCAM SCD6040.  It fortunately broke 1 week before the warranty ran out.  The video began having giant pixilated squares when video taping and on playback.  Though under warranty, it still cost me $49 (their fee) to send in the camera for a repair.  The repaired camera came back broken.  I had to deal with many customer service people, but finally got them to agree mine was a "lemon" and they sent me the SCD6550.  Now 10 months later, the video and playback on this duocam has broken.  You see a black screen with yellow blocks on the LCD and through the viewfinder.  I cannot video tape or playback anything on tape.  It is not under warranty.  I can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year.  They must use cheap parts.  PLEASE save yourself the headache and chose another brand.
