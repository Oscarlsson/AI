I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy.  Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  Very disappointed with this purchase.  I guess it's true what they say. "You get what you pay for"  It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much
