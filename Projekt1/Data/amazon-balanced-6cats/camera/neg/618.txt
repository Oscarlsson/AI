I have many pet peaves about this camera.

a) the video showed untrue colors and came out rather dark----don't try to record indoors

b) didn't fit into my hand naturally and had to use two hands to navigate the menu and even the record button. NOT GOOD

c) didn't start up fast enough---I always missed the shot

d) the camera photos aren't of good quality

e) microphone not that great---you couldn't even hear people that were standing ten feet away from the camera.

f) if your laptop is over 3 years old, even if you've got Windows XP, don't expect the software to be compatible.

g) the zoom lens zoomed to fast at the movement of my finger. I'd lightly press the zoom button to one side and it zoomed too fast and it did the same for zooming out. I felt like I had to just manually zoom----ie. walk up closer to the subject

I honestly say stay away from the Samsung's and the Sony's aren't much better and they have a monopoly on the matching accessories, ie. only Sony products are compatible with the camcorder.

I finally bought a JVC and they are awesome----the take more light in, better acoustical recording, better zoom function, quicker start up, and lighter. You can even buy the cheapest model (which is pretty much what I've got) and the picture is great! My parents commented on how they thought I must have a camera like the News reporters, as it's the same quality
