To add on to the previous reviewers, I was very disappointed with this camera's performance.  I compared the "5 megapixel" photos with photos taken with my Canon, PowerShot G3 (4megapixels), and the SCD6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills.  The camera itself also seemed flimsy.  The idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive.  But another attractive concept, Canon's Elura50, offered a camcorder with a compact design.  In the end, however, it broke down only after a year and a half.  For a $500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan (cf. reviews for Elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems).  This camera seemed less durable than the Elura50 as I maneuvered the various parts and dials.  Of course, I am returning the camera before it can prove its durability.  Nevertheless, maybe the folks at CNet can stake their money on it.  Lastly, I should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed.  I found that I had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button.  This definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments.

Again, this camera is a great idea.  But, I suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording.  This one is on the right track, but, still so far from accomplishing a quality product.
