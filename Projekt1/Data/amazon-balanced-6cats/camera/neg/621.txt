The SCD6550 is a great idea, but just doesn't preform as I had hoped.  I was looking for one camera to take on vacation, replacing carrying a 2 year old Sony MiniDV and a 5 MP Sony CyberShot.  My Sony takes 1 MP stills, has excellent video, but @ 1MP, the stills are not nearly print worthy.  This camera is actually smaller and lighter than my Sony.

The 5MP still camera function gave excellent results, both with flash and with natural light and outside.  Shot for shot it produced either as good or better prints (4x6) than the Sony CyberShot.  

Digital video is this unit's short coming.  I did identical shots inside and outside with the Sony and Samsung.  The Samsung's video quality was very poor, looked more like analog or standard 8mm quality.  Inside, with natural room lighting, it was pretty much unacceptable.  Outside, the shots lacked the crispiness of the Sony.  I took it back, will keep the Sony's and hope that Sony comes out with a greater than 2 or 3 MP model soon
