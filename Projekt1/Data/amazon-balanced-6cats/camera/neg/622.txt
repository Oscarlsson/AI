These are NOT pioneer boxes.  These are MBI boxes. I bought them and was very disappointed since I also have bought pioneer boxes before, and when I compared with the MBI, the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the Pioneer's.  Do not buy these.

Also, Adorama's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied.  They insist that they are the same, that I need to return them on my cost, because of their mistake.  They flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products, to Amazon's mistake in naming them Pioneer.  But then their own website also has named them Pioneer.  Anyway, just reconsider about buying any products from this company. It's not worth it, considering the shipping is outrageously high.  It is my honest opinion.
