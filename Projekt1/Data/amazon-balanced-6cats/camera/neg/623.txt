I have to agree with the other reviews of this scope.  I purchased this scope as a Christmas gift.  When I opened it, the equatorial mount (the basis for the ENTIRE scope) was broken.  I contacted Celestron and was promised another part for it, which never arrived.  I contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me.  It DIDN'T FIT.  Finally, I was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope.  The equatorial mount was in 1 piece.. yeah!  Too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and I could not assemble this one. I even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support (who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived) and all I got was a bunch of excuses.
I finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one ENTIRE telescope.  It's February and I just now have a product that works.  (I haven't had time to try it though!)  Celestron offered no refunds for this telescope, so buyer beware.  If they are not willing to satisfy customers, your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells. Good luck
