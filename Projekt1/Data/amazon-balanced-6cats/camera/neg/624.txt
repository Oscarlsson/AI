First off, many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope....I cannot even comment on how well this telecope works because the TWO that were sent to me were BROKEN!

I ordered well before Christmas as a gift for my son...but to be his big gift from Santa Claus.  My husband opened the telescope up late Christmas Eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the Christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken.  The 2 mounting screws were  bent, very bent.  This puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child.

After A WHOLE LOT OF EFFORT with Amazon's customer service (from another country!) they sent a replacement...to the WRONG ADDRESS!!  (long story that I will not bore you with.)

When the 2nd telescope arrived my husband once again opens it up and guess what?  They same screws were again bent.  The box on the outside was not damaged, but something is not working for them.

I am so disapointed with them.  This was the first time I had purchased something this big from Amazon.  I have mainly done music and movies, small stuff. 

After this experience I will NO LONGER buy a big ticket item that would have the possibility of damage.  It's just not worth the headache and problems, not to mention DISAPOINTMENT, to my son.  

I would proceed with caution when ordering this item from Amazon.  If you get a broken one...you just might be receiving the 2 I have had to return
