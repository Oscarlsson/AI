My ownership of this camera was brief.  First, you must know I love Nikon.  I have 2 other Nikons--an old Cooplix 2200 and a Coolpix 5700.  They have wonderful lenses and give great pix.  I thought my experience with this model would be similar.  NOT!~  From picture numero uno, the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate.  I got pictures, yes, but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens.  What a dissappointment!  I traded it in for a Canon A520 and am happy with that camera.  I suppose it is just what it is.  If I'd saved and spent a lot more money on a D50 or Rebel, who knows?  Anyway,  that is my sad tale with the Nikon 4800
