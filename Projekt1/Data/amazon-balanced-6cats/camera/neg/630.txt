I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP
