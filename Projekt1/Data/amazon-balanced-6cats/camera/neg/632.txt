I agree with the two previous reviewers.  There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  This isn't very helpful for star gazing.  The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together
