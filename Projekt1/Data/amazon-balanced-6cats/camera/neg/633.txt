On reciept of the tripod, I found it wrapped and packed (on the outside)in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product.  When I opened the box, I found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box.  There was minimal packing around the tripod itself, mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching, and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around.  I have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping.  Also, if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company, instructions are not part of their package
