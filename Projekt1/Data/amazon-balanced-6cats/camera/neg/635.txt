I own the Olympus FE-100 Digital camera, and it came with unchargeable batteries (oxyride). I switched to Energizer Batteries and bought an Energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas. It's not a quick charger like this one, but I say for less than half the investment, I've got a charger that does the job. I would NOT spend this kind of money on a charger. So I say, if you're part of the "gotta have it now" generation, you definitely pay for convenience. Otherwise, charge your batteries more slowly (2-3 hours) and save a lot of money
