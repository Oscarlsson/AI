Two months. . .the amount of time in which I saved to purchase what I thought was an 8 megapixel camera for a steal. . .

One week. . .to find that no matter what I tried I was utterly dissapointed. . .

1)No matter the setting EVERY picture is drowned out by the flash and withouth the flash the picture is nothing more than I horrible blur.

2)The 5 minute 2 time flash is horrible. . .every person I try to get a picture of thinks it has taken the picture before the final flash even goes off resulting in 90% horrible family photos. 

I could go on but I wont. . .I cant even stress my dissapointment in my waste of money. . .there is a reason that it is not the bestselling camera on amazon. . .BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH IT.

I now have to save up for another and hopefully pawn this off on someone with less expectancy in a camera
