this thing stinks! so much digital noise its output is terrible. I don't know how they can put this thing out and have it be so BAD. Don't be fooled thinking WOW 8 megs for a low price, I have a 5 meg sony that is many times better. all that noise blows the detail out. get it if you like lots of little green and red flecks in your pictures, other wise stay away
