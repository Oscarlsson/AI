I ordered this tripod, and it arrived broken.

The assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic.    I asked for an RMA order via E-Mail, and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice.'

Being lazy about mailing things back, and since it was cheap to begin with I tried repair it myself.  Where it broke (the three plastic rings on the camera mount), it was impossible to re-glue, because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure.  

Even if your tripod arrives un-broken, it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all.
