The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
