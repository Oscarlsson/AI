After reading the many good reviews here, I too bought the Lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my Canon digital camera.  I was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  The only difference I noticed between the Lenmar and OEM battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the LCD screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the Lenmar battery that with the OEM.  This was not a problem until I was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the Lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  I could view previously taken pictures (LCD OK) but any new photo I tried to take was black. I read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  Once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  So, was it the Lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  Would it have happened if the cooler running OEM battery was installed on the hot day?  I can't say for sure, but if you use a Lenmar battery I would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the LCD since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).
