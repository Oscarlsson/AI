This kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper. Unfortunately, Kodak doesn't contain an ink cartridge for them.

Fine, I thought, I'll buy a separate cartridge. Guess what? You can't! Kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper. Why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges? Seems pretty dirty
