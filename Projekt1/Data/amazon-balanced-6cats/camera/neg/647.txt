I purchased, through work, the PowerShot S70 in July of 2005.  I've always owned Nikon products personally, but the features for the price of the S70 swayed me away from my usual Nikon brand loyalty.  In the 12 months I've had the S70, it's been sent to the factory twice for repairs--the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired.  The first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track.  Eight months later, the flash quit working in all modes AND the door was failing AGAIN!

The flash and door problem occurred while I was in Yosemite NP, so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning.  

Now, the warranty is expired and I hold my breath every time I slide the lens door open.  I have no faith in the Canon S70 and have lost a lot faith in Canon products as a whole.

The only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within 2-3 weeks, which I thought was fast for warranty work
