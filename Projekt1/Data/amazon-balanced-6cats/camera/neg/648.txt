I received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it. It screws in over the regular ZOOM lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the KODAK DX6490. I suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future. The lens adapter by itself, doesn't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else ???
