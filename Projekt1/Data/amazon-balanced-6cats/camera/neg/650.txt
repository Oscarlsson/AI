I just got this printer dock with a camera, and the printer feature is a real pain!  The paper will almost never feed no matter what I've tried.  When it does feed, it ends up jamming.  I only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone.  I'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back
