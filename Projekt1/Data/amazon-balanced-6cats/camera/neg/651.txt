I recently purchased the G600 printer dock and haven't even gotten to try it out yet--the print cartridge that came with it didn't work.  I ordered another and inserted it and it still doesn't work. It constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced.  Lots of time and money involved in this mess---stick with HP!
