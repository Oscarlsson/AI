Here's the Good News: 
I have had many cameras in my life, digital and film , and I have found the Z1 to be my favorite.  The camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color.  My previous camera was a Minolta Dimage 7($800) and I found that this camera's photo quality was just as good.  The best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily.  Owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life.

Here's the Bad News:
Recently my camera broke and when I tried to contact Fuji to get a replacement or a repair, the service was terrible.  Their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support.  

Summary:
Great camera as long as it doesn't break.  It's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get Fuji to repair it
