I bought the camera in May of 2006, as a graduation gift for my son.  He loved the style and compactness.

He experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use.  Unfortunately he didn't start to use the gift for 2 months or I might have been able to return to Amazon for a refund.  Contacting Fufifilm has been overly cumbersome. Their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive (LONG WAITS).  They have had the toy camera (AS THIS IS BEING WRITTEN)for over a week and when I called yesterday for status, they told me that the camera "hasn't been diagnosed yet".  I expect it will be, once their 90 day warranty expires, which will limit Fujifilm's liability to the 1 repair.  I have a mean case of buyer's remorse.  I might as well have taken the ~$235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street.

If you own one and it doesn't require repairs, you might like it.  If it ever requires repairs, you might feel as I that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera.  Save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty, a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty.  You may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired.  I bought it in May of 2006....I feel like I lost it in July of 2006.

IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THE Z1 LESS THEN 1 STAR, I WOULD HAVE.  THAT'S WHAT IT DESERVES!   !&%$$##444EN FUJIFIL
