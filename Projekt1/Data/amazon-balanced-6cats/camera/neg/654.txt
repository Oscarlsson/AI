Bought this camera for my wife.  Takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution.  If you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill.  Fuji customer relations is sub-par.  Warranty does not cover any impact internal damage.  I've had better luck with Nikon and Kodak and will steer clear of Fuji in the future
