This is absolutely the worse digital device I have ever owned.  The manual is worthless and the web site even worse.  I try to delete the included photos, and nothing happens.  I can't download photos from my Mac.  If your digital memory card has many photos, good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame.
