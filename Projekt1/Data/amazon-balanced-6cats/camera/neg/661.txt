I wish there was a space for zero stars.  We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died.  It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing.  Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently.  Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do
