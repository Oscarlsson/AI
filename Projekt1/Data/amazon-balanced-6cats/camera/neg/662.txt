I received Pandigital 7" Photo Frame (DPF70-2) as a Christmas gift and haven't been able to get the SD Card slot to function. When connecting to the PC via USB cable it tells me the removable device needs to be formatted.  Windows attempts to format the card and fails.  I'm able to format the card with a USB Card Reader and copy pictures to the SD card OK.  When I insert the SD Card into the Photo Frame is doesn't display any of the pictures, just a blue frame around the picture location.

I contacted PanDigital Tech Support via 800# and never received a call back so I sent them an email.  I received email response back after several days.  They had me try several things to resolve the issue; this troubleshooting process went on for more than week to no avail. They eventually acknowledged the Photo Frame appeared defective, When I asked to exchange the Photo Frame (taking advantage of the 90 day warranty advertised on their site), they told me to return it to the store it was purchased.

I do not consider this very good customer service; I would not recommend this product.
