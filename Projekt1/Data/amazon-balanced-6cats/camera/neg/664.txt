Keep in mind that you can't use this product unless you buy an external flash. The built-in flash results in harsh shadows on the left edge of the photos.

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the PowerShot G6.
We are sorry to hear of any issues with the Conversion lens.

When using the built-in flash, a portion of the image may be blocked by the converters and appear dark. 
Please refer to page 186 of the camera manual for detailed information. 
When the converters are used, it is recommended to not use the built-in flash.

Thank you for choosing Canon
