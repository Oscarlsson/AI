I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda.  It was ok.  Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products
