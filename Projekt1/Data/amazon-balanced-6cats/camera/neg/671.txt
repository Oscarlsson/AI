Ok this is the third Sony Handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options..Sony Messed up with the USB port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the TRV 280

i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the TRV 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality..its fuzzy.. im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the TRV280 back..



I hope this has helpe
