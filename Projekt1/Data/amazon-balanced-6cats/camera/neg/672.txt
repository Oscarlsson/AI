Not worth the money spent on it.  After reviewing info on my new digital camera I followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on AA batteries.  I did not need the camera case that came with this kit, and it really had too many pockets for my liking.  The batteries did not hold a charge.  I only got a few pictures taken before they went dead.  If the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead.  At least I got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones.  I would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots.  I have had no experience with rechargables before so I do not know if this is common.  But I returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge
