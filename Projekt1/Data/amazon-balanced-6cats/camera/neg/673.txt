We ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5-7 hours.
It stopped working all of the sudden (no power)

Sent it for warranty, (part no labor). $160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it.

Would not but another camcorder from Panasonic (they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back)
