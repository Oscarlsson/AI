This camcorder worked well, but I had two complaints with it.
1.  On the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth, sounds like a woodpecker.  This alone made it unacceptable or what I wanted to do.
2.  I wanted high quality video, but since it records on a small dvd disk, the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk.  This causes some loss of detail in the picture, especially if you're going to edit it and rerecord the video which I need to do.
If you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player (and not all dvd players will play the small dvds) this camera might be acceptable.  I returned it and bought a Panasonic PV-GS35miniDV camcorder which uses the miniDV cassette tape.  Much better video quality because its not compressd, and no noise from the tape drive
