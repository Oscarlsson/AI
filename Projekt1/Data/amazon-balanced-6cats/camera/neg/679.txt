Don't order this battery unless you have money to throw away!  I ordered one that would not hold a charge, called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back.  Did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad.  Now after 3 months, it isn't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time!!!  This is unacceptable, and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product!  AVOID AT ALL COST, EVEN IF THAT MEANS PAYING THE EXTRA $10 BUCKS FOR AN ORIGINAL KODAK BRANDED BATTERY
