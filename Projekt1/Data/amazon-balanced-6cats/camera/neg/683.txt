As I have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult, as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus.  I thought this might be a solution.

This Eyecup fails on all requards.  Worst feature, the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect.  Second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless.   Last it has the cheep feel of Cracker Jack plastic, well and the optics to match.  Now I know where Olympus had it manufactured
