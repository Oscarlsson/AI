I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera.
