If you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok.. but why buy this monster for that? I have a T1 that does the trick there and gives 5MP. 
Ok, so maybe video? ok, but then why do I want a dvd with nothing but raw footage? cant edit it without a lot of work. (where is the firewire port, or even the ability to edit an mpg file?) geeez.. 
anyway.. I am taking mine back. it is totally useless to me as I already have a still shot camera.. save your money.. dont do it..
