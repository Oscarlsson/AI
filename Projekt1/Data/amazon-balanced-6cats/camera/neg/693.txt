This is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. This case is bulky and my Panasonic FXO1 would fit into something much smaller. I ended up going with a great case that i found at Wal-Mart for a cheeper price, sleeker design, small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town
