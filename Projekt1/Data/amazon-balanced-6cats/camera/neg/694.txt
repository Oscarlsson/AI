This case looks good and protects the camera adequately, but is too bulky. It hasn't got a lot of room inside - I was unable to fit an extra SD card in its little case and a spare battery. The belt clip is difficult to use, and I end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time. There are better cases for this camera
