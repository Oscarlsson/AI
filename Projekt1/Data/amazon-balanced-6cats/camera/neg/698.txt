I like this camera.  Some settings take it beyond the standard point and shoot experience. For a first-timer, it has been great. The camera rates 4 stars.

Customer service, on the other hand, has been a disaster. An Easy Share software downloaded update didn't load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1/2 hours with no resolution. After requesting to speak to a customer service manager, I was promised that a $7.95 CD of the software would be sent for free (though it was clear he was doing me a favor because "these cd's cost money and don't grow on trees," he said. Whether or not the CD solves the problem remains to be seen. But customer service is awful.

To recap: Nice camera, but unless you have endless customer service patience, search out other options
