I keep this frame on all day and night. The LCD backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out.
The quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close.

There is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. Regular LCD backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. This one just lasted 4 months. So the image is almost non-existant now. In the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead.

I would recommend a more expensive Philips ones. My friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't
