I bought this product from a nearby retailer. The packaging is deceptive. The Photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer. The battery is $35.00 with shipping, and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring. This frame has no on-board memory, so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts. This is an additional expense. After purchasing the Photoframe I discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should. I took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before I found one which had an unbroken frame. I took that Photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described. I then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device (the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer). With the retailer's very helpful clerks I tested three more PhotoCo Photoframe devices, none of them worked as described (they would not scroll through and album of photos). I returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device, then by email I requested a refund for the price of the battery. Photoco replied that if I sent them the battery they would refund its price. I mailed the battery on May 6,and then inquired about my refund on May 14. PhotoCo replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick. On 3/17 I sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund. PhotoCo said that my credit had been processed but that I might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days. I still have not received my credit for the battery. If you want to avoid a headach, avoid doing business with this company. Read the other reviews before considering this product
