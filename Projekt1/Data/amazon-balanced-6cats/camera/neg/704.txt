The Photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering.  The "Plug and Play" ability is aggravating, at best, freezing two of my computers, requiring endless reboots to transfer images.  Photoshare provides ZERO customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual. The expensive battery is almost impossible to install.  The power cord has to be super glued to stay in place. And the frame is sloppy and dangerous - very easy for unit to fall out.  Buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable DVD player instead.
