I added these batteries to an order of a few other things, and didn't realize that they were going to ship this separately from Circuit city. Make sure if you pick this, that you are getting something else from CC, or else you will end up like me. With a huge box (you could fit 4 Tom Clancey novels in the box) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries
