This unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on/off switch has a serious design flaw.  I received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power.  After that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on.  It then failed completely and would not work at at all.

I returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that. On both units the mp3 player continued to work.  

There is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and/or the on/off switch.  

But for this problem it would be a wonderful unit
