Tried this as a possible improvement over using AA NiHM batteries in my Olympus D-524 camera. Turned out to be a DOWNGRADE. Did not stay charged as long as my Panasonic 1950 mAh AA batts. It would die a sudden death -- no low battery warnings before the camera shut down. I have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the AA NiHM batts. The CR-V3 now gathers dust. It did not even improve the flash recycle time. Just a waste
