THE battery is good after a full charge.  It lacks in holding the promised charge.  I find after 2 weeks it is questionable, depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again. I got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days, Which is more that my AA nimh 2100mah. Which I bought from Walmart {so probably not a super battery}  The wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer {very sad}.The charge time is not to long when charger from half charge.
Over all, I hope the next ones I buy will be better than these.  My solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the Delkin dies.  I also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house, as there is no memory effect.  I also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera.  Every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level.  My Nikon coolpix 3100, seems to shut down sooner than later.  All reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason.  Have been using 3 months now.
