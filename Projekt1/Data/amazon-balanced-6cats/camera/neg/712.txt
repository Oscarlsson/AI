I've had this battery for half a year and I agree with a fellow reviewer's assessment that the battery does not hold much power. I am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory, but this Delkin model's life span was noticeably short. Now i am going to buy a new charger/battery altogether because I don't want to buy another Delkin battery
