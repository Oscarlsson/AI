  I purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework, and reading all the reviews I could on the different kinds. The one I purchased was flawed, and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before I could get it to boot up. When it was running I was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures.
  What the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable- so it does not hook up to a computer. This means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera, or that you must have/purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card.( A side note - if you have a Sony digital camera, Memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent, you took with another camera, or you reformatted with a photo program). 
  I went with the digital pic frame from Brookstone instead - far better quality, and MUCH more user friendly
