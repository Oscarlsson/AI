In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  My brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their EX-S500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate
