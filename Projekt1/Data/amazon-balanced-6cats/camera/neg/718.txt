I ordered this digital frame for my husband for Christmas, with the assurance from a "tech weenie" that it would work, based on the advertisement found at Amazon. Still uncertain whether the ad (also found in Philips cursory literature) is really true. My husband is working with the "phone people" at Philips to determine whether it will or will not interface with MAC. If it does eventually work, the process has not been easy
