I was extremely disappointed with this camera.  It's a shame there is no option for zero stars, because it doesn't even deserve one.  I bought two of them for a vacation to Belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water, and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera.  Now I really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can. 

All of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible, terrible quality.  The camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water.  Those pictures were so grainy that we couldn't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of.  Extremely disappointing for a camera that wasn't even submerged in water.  Not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none, so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they weren't even on the negatives.

I was so disappointed in this camera that I wrote to Kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras.  Unfortunately our trip to Belize was a once in a lifetime trip, so I have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done.  And I have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again. If you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories, DO NOT waste your money on this one.  The only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment.  I wish I had done more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother with it
