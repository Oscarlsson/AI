I purchased this camera and took it to the beach.  The photos were so bad, I threw them away.  The images were all washed-out and blurry.  Also, the film advancing mechanism is very tricky, so several of the pictures I took overlapped each other.  I've used other disposable cameras before that wouldn't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame.  With this camera, I advanced the film until the mechanism stopped, and the camera allowed me to take another picture.  Unfortunately, the film hadn't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that I had taken.  What a waste of money this camera was!

Thankfully, I had also taken my digital camera, so I still had some good pictures of my trip :)
