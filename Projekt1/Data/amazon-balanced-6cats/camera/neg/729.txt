I bought this camera after using a Sony MiniDV (very small one) camera over 8 years. The image quality of Sanyo is horrible compared to my old Sony under any condition: daylight, night etc. However price, size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time. So if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it, but this is not a serious replacement to a high-end camcorder.
