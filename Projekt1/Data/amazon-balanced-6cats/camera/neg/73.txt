After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read "e18".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18", and you'll see what I meant.

Don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight
