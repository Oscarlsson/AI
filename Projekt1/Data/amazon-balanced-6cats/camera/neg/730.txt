I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try.

After one battery charge, I was "lucky" enough to have a defective unit - the camera wouldn't start again after the first charge.

My observations from that first short use were:
- Quality of pictures was very poor (my Pentax Optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera.
- The flash was generally useless, and actually hurt quality
- The camera was very uncomforable if you don't have very small hands.  My wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes.
- The video was ok, but the focus was very slow (and noisy).
- I had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it (shows very poor quality).

All-in-all don't waste your money.  You can get a much better camera at a lower price
