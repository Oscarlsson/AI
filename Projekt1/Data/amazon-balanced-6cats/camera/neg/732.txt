In theory, this camera is perfect. Fits into your pocket. Video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of MPEG-4. Pictures are good if you know how to finesse it. Perfect all around anytime camrea, right?

Here's the thing. I got the camera mainly for video. I just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that I could always have on me. Also, I did not want miniDV because uploading to the computer is real time. I wanted the SD card as film, even if it would sacrfice some video quality. But the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor/ auotfocus nosie. On the playback I cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses. It sounds like someone smoking a hooka. And get this, it even says so in the instruction manual, page 35, "CAUTION During video clip playback, the sound of a motor is audible....During recording, the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded. This is not a malfunction."

Awful.

By the way, the take a picture while recording video function is worthless. It leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording, and the still image captured is usually blury. Whats the point anyway, I think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video. Or you can do it with whatever editing software you use.

Oh, and one last thing. I have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic. My hand shakes too much. There is a digital stabalization for the video, but no optical stabilization for the stills.

Its a big shame, too. The camera is very cool. If not for the audible motor noise, I would have given this at least an 8/10. But the lens motor noise is unacceptable!

ps. all cameras today should have a built in lens cover. This is one has a cheap plastic one, that you'll probably lose
