I really wanted to love this camera. The camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans! 

I did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so I expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews. The 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video... but the unit fits into my pocket! Another huge plus is that each "shot" is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a PC using a USB cable. No further processing - the file just copies and plays in Quicktime, etc. Another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie, which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do.

Now the sad part; Amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the LCD and CCD. The bad pixels on the LCD, according to the manual, are expected and "Not a malfunction"; I disagree with that. For the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the LCD monitor. The HUGE problem is the bad pixels on the CCD! This results with white pixels being recorded on the files; this is compounded by the "image stabilization". The image stabilization shifts the image the CCD receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great! However, as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well. It's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record.

The bad CCD is the reason why I can't love the C6... I gave up hope and sent both back to Amazon. I'm not sure what I will buy now.
