I bought this camera in the beginning of January. I was looking for a compact camera (not necessarily pocket size, though) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality. Based on test reports at DPreview and other customer reports I decided for the Fuji F31fd. I was intrigued by the new sensor that Fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive, which is true. After receiving the camera I took a lot of test pictures under various conditions, with and without flash, bright light, low light, different ISO settings, different exposure times, etc. I compared the pictures with my 4-year old SONY DSC-V1 and the results were amazing. The picture quality of the Fuji was very poor. Colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise. Even under bright light conditions and ISO 100 settings the white had considerable noise, same with other colors (RGB noise). I didn't check grey/black noise (as they do in the test reports) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying. What a disappointment. The lens seemed to be pretty poor as well, at least there was no comparison to the SONY DSC-V1 with a Carl Zeiss lens. After one week we returned the camera and I bought the SONY H5. This is really a great camera, I must admit. The picture quality is even better than with the V1 and I thought that the V1 was already pretty good. I can only recommend SONY's H5, even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller F31fd. What I liked about the F31fd was its size, its responsiveness and the monitor and menu. However, if the picture quality is so poor it also doesn't really help
