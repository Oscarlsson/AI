I bought these binoculars because I wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding.  First time out, I had difficulty getting a clear focus.  To make maters worse, every bird that I looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it's head.  I have a pair of Nikon 10X25s which out performed the Bushnell's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness. I am returning the Bushnell's and considering the Audubon Equinox HP binoculars instead.
