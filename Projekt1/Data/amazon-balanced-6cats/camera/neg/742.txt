In my opinion this is not a marketable product. The cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work. There is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix. When it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit. As for HD - possibly at high noon in the Sahara, but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing.
