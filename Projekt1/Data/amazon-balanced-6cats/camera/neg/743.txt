The quality is not real HD looking.  The footage is jumpy.  The camera is terrible in low light.  Even indoors during the day, you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image.  I returned mine and I'm looking to getting the much better Sony HD cam which is almost double the price, but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it.  Being a professional filmmaker and knowing what Cameras shoot real HD, I quickly realized that I got ripped off.  This may be good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during the day, but don't expect to bring it to a party, club, or out on the town at night.  It seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent.  The size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great.  I was really disappointed because I was expecting something better.  Most digital cameras shoot better video, seriously
