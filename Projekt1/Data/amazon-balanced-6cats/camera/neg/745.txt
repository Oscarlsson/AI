I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera? Just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem
