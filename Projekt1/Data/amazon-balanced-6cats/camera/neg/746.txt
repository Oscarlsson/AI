This camera has major problems.  Do your research.  Go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of  the "black Screen".    After using our camera about 5 times the screen became black.  Apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something.  Sent it to their customer care service.  Took 1 month to get back.  3 days later black screen is back.  Sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera.  They just want me to keep sending to customer. Care.     Sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras.  See for yourself.   Go to the forums and see what others have been saying.  Don't make the mistake I did
