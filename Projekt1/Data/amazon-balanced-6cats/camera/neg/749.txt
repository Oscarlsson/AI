I purchased a Nikon for my first camera, I just loved how you can take it anywhere, fits handy in your pocket and perfect size. I couldn't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo's. For my birthday I took over 100 photo's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost. I was so devistated. The video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people's faces. My friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo's. So maybe I just got the short end of the stick...but this was my first camera so its okay for starters...but if you love to take photo's be full aware that on a LOW BATTERY that it just might not want to hold them. A major plus I do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image! That I'll give 5 stars to...everything else I'd have to say 2 stars!
