I agree with reviewer Steve - anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless.  The paper works says the "may" focus down to 35'.  Maybe some will but not certainly not my pair.  I am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard.  And no, the rubber eye caps ABSOLUTELY will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses (like me).
