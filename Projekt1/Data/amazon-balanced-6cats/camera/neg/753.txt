My cheap 10X50 Rugged Exposure brand binoculars give me a better view.  The rubber eye cups did not stay folded back for use with my glasses and I couldn't get my glasses close enough to eleviate the round "binocular effect".  I did a side-by-side comparison with my cheap binocs and liked the cheap ones better - my vision is not that bad either.  Maybe with perfect vision they would work for, but I doubt it
