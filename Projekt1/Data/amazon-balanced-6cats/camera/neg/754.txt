The roll of paper that I recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper.  I am trying to get it replaced but Adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old.  I was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues.
