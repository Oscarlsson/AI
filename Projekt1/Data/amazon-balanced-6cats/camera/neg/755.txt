...unless they hadn't insisted on the "geared" telescopic part. It has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it, but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time I used it. It's extremely annoying because overall it's not a bad tripod, but it really didn't need that bit of "hi-tech", and now I am unable to use the telescopic part at all... 

Yes, it's lightweight and somewhat unstable, but I can live with that. The biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials...
