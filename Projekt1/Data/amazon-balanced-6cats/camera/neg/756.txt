I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera
