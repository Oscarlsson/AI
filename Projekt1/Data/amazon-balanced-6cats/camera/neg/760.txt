This is the 7th Olympus camera I've owned over the years, from film to digital.  I have always been very pleased with Olympus cameras and their usual superior optics.  This camera, though, is a major disappointment, mainly because even though it can shoot in RAW, there is no compatible conversion available yet, leaving you unable to process RAW images.  This renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in JPEG.  Olympus should have ensured that vendors such as Adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible RAW conversion Plug-ins available before this camera hit the market.  There's no excuse for Olympus to not have made sure this was the case, indeed it's downright irresponsible.

Having said the above, the camera lens is quite nice, the camera itself operates well.  You can take quite good pictures.  However, the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken----if you're taking pictures of people, they will have moved by the time the picture is taken.

The battery life is very good.  The camera fits nicely in your palm. And, having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great.  

If you don't shoot in RAW and you don't depend on flash photography, the camera is worth a look.  Otherwise, look at other products at this time
