The case looks exactly as in the pictures above, and the camera fits perfectly in it. However, the case is hardly a protection, it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. The velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so I've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. Fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around, so my camera stays with me in any event.
There is a little strap on the case, supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps, but it opens too easily, so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case, which is not much).
There is also a small pocket in the back, providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 AA batteries) and the USB cable. Again, the velcro on it is too easy to open, even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket.
Definitely, this is not designed as a practical solution. Just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches.
If you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun, while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents, DON'T buy this one. Spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. I will
