In the past, I have considered Amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites. To be perfectly honest, I am no longer sure. Two months ago, I bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on Amazon. This camera set was called the 1 GB Stylus 720 SW kit. Ironically, the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 GB cards! My first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories. Two weeks after receiving the kit, I emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake. After waiting a few weeks for a response, I decided to send them a second email. Again, no response. By this point, I felt helpless and turned to Amazon for aid. Surprisingly, Amazon was not much better than 47th st photo. Minutes after sending the email to Amazon, I received an automatic email informing me that Amazon had received my email. That was the last I heard from Amazon. More than two months have passed and I have not heard from either company
