I have purchased the pv-gs65 and everytime I use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds.  I returned my camcorder and got another one (pvgs65) and I am still having this problem.  everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus.

If anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review.
