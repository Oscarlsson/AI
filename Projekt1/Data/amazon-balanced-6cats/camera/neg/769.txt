So, you go out and plunk down nearly 600 bucks of your hard-earned cash for a Panasonic PB-GS65 DV camcorder. It is a digital video camcorder, after all. That's why you bought it. Well, guess what? It doesn't come with a DV cable to plug it into anything. That is so pathetically stupid I take it as an outright slap from a company that must think I'm just some sort pain in their shorts. It cost me completion of a project that I had to put together as soon as the camera arrived. So, Panasonic, I'll post a negative review of as many of your products I possibly can over the next few weeks and make you pay as much as possible for being about as stupid a company as I've ever had to deal with. Oh yeah, and you're camcorder is being returned. Go buy a cable and have a ball
