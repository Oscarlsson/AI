For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good
