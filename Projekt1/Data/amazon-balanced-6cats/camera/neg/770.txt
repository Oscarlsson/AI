We purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera.  It took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today's reasonably priced miniDV camcorders.  However after six months the LCD screen suddenly stopped working.  It was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great.  We sent it last November to the Panasonic authorized service center.  They returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available.  We were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old.  I only share this as a warning to potential buyers.  Panasonic did not honor our warranty
