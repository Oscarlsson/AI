Bought this housing new in November 2005.In April I used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive! Neither Amazon (since it is ouside the 30 day return policy) nor Canon will stand behind this product! Period! I got so much run around from Canon it was ridiculous. They wanted to "evaluate" the housing to determine if it was defective...DAH? They WOULD NOT tell me if I sent it back for the "evaluation" what the final resolution would be (refund, rework etc). 
 Coincidentally, another person on the same trip had the same housing...it flooded on their first dive too!!!!
Coincidence? No. Just terrible quality control and NO product support from Canon. DO NOT BUY CANON PRODUCTS!!
