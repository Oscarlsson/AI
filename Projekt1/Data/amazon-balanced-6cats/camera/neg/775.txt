The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense.
Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours.
Other than the above, the monocular has performed well.
epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it.
