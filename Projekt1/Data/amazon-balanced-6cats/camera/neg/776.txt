I bought this item over a year ago, and it has never served for anything. Once I spotted a deer and turned on the "IR" illuminator, and the deer ran away - not too surprising, it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals. Better use a flashlight. This is a first-generation nightscope, and has a very small range of utility: If there is a little light, the adapted human eye sees better, and if there is almost no light the device does not see either. 100 bucks is not too much of a waste, but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much
