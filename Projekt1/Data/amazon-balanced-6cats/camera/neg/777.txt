The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.  

Also, there is too much "noise" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing.

The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.  

Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.  

By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic
