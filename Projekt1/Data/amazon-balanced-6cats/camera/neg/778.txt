It was suggested by Amazon.com that I buy this product since I was purchasing a Canon PowerShot S2IS Digital Camera. Not knowing any better, I bought it.  It doesn't even WORK with this model camera. I bought a memory card reader instead at a local store & bypassed the need for an adapter altogether
