It takes too long to focus and shoot! This, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible.  People who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by Nikon or total nubs.

Do not buy this camera. 

It did take decent movies, and the size is nice
