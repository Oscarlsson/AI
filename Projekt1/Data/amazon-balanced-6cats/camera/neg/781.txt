i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked.  the older model is far superior.  this camera is slow to focus, slow to shoot, and slow to save.  i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition (indoor, medium light) on the automatic setting, all 5 pictures turned out different, only one turned out clear.  i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with
