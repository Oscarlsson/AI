The eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable.

But of course  you can 'buy' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer.
The whole thing was a waste of time...I gave it to my five year old to trash.  At least he will have some fun with it that way....it's realy just a childs toy.
