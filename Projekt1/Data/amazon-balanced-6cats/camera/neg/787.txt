I have owned numerous Celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures, so I expected better. I ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. In Celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. Amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and I'm upgrading her to another telescope. I'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. Only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily
