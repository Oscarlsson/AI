Nice look, good feel, turns on fast, takes great pictures.  Really great, with ridiculous depth of field and resolution, you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the LCD back, which is huge.  So, what's my beef?  Slow pictures, double flash, slow slow follow on shot, slow.  Okay say cheese, one second, two seconds.... i only got thiis camera because I thought that problem was solved.  Yes my battery is charged, no I do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye? slow- i hate it!!!!!!  Still, its awsome, slick, and a fair price
