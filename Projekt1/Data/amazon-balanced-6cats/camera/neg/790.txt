After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod (here and elsewhere), I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder. 

When I first opened the box, the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made.  The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well.  However, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly.  It felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case.  In fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.

I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning.  However, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, I'm assuming that I just received a bad one.

I'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me.  So far, Amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day.  They say that I'll receive my new tripod next week.  I'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.

UPDATE:  I received a new replacement VCT870RM tripod from Amazon, and this one works great.  Panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable.  If I'd have received this tripod originally, I would've given it 5 stars.  The first VCT870RM I received was definitely defective.  I'm glad I returned it, and I'm glad I bought it through Amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return)
