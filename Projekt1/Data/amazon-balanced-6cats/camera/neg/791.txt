Like other reviewers, after careful research, I decided to purchase this product. It was affordable, received good reviews, and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range. When I received it in mail, I was quite happy: it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what I had expected. The screen was bright and very attractive. 

The problems started about three weeks following the purchase. First, the slideshow option (the kind with music) stopped working. Whenever I pushed the slideshow button, the screen would completely freeze and I had to restart the unit in order to use any other function. I thought, no big deal, I would just exchange the frame for another one.

My second unit arrived yesterday. This one, however, started having problems right out of the box. After about 5 minutes into the slideshow, the screen started flickering, than shaking, became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically. I played it two more times after that, each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow.

It is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential (big, bright screen); unfortunately, the software is very buggy. I checked the Portable USA website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix. I will have to return this unit again, this time for a refund.

My assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box. However, I would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership
