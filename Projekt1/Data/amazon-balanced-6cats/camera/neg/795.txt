I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.
