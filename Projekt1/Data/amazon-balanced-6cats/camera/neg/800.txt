Amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product.  Usually I like to have actually used the product before writing a review, but since I haven't received it yet, that is not possible.  It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com.  Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now.  I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user.  I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon.  I hear DV cable does it's job, but I'll have to wait and see
