I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great, but then I realized it would only display 142 images. I worked with technical support for several months (they are not the speediest or most helpful). I resized, renamed, restructured the photos, tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug. I RMA'd the unit at my shipping expense of course, only to recieve another with the same problem.  I wouldn't recommend this purchase
