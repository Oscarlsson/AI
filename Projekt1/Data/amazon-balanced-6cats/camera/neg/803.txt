Received the 'first' unit which was missing cables and had a non-functional remote.  Played MP3's, mov, and displayed pictures fine.  Would have been happy enough if all the parts were present and working.  Returned this unit and received a second which didn't work, didn't even have a remote or speakers (561 in a 562 box?).  Time for another replacement - which came without remote, with speakers, but faulty software or micro?  Menu's one deep were blank rectangles which didn't function and MP3's which played on the first unit locked up this unit - same for mov files.  Actually tried a forth time because the first unit seemed to be OK functionally, but last unit was exactly the same as previous with blank menu's and faulty functionality.  E-mailed Digital Spectrum and have not received a reply, which actually led me to write this feedback!  Hard to believe this company will survive if they don't straighten up their act
