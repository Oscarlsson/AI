I recently bought a new Celestron Nexstar 4SE telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit.  Much to my disappointment, the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope, and when cold (nights in Colorado are 25-45F), the eyepieces did not fit at all.  

Celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised.  When I called a second time, they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem.  Amazon replaced the kit (Thank you Amazon!), but the replacements did not fit either.  I'm returning that kit too.  I finally bought a kit from Meade (3 eyepieces and a moon filter) that fit properly and are very easy to use.  

To be fair, if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value (hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1).  The Meade kit is a worse value, but because they work in my nice new scope, they are the best for anyone using a Nexstar 4SE
