Cons only, no pros:
the velcro closure is week and opens easily
terrible look
the side zippers are a mistery, totally useless
no space for extra memory or battery
attaches only to a very small belt
the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash
