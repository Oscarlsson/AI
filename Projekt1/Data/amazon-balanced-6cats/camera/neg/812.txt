Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.
