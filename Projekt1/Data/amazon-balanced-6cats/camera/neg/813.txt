I purchased this camera in December 2005 to replace my 7 year old Sony Digital 8 camcorder. Unfortunately, everything except size is inferior in the Panasonic compared to the "ancient" Sony.  The color is not nearly as sharp, the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long.  The sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself. The camera's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer's editing program.

The Panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other miniDV camcorders lack. This allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights. It uses a toggle to control the exposure and, while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the Sony, it is adequate.  Unfortunately, it functions so poorly in low light it wouldn't provide adequate color in an auditorium.

I thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the Panasonic than my old Sony. Maybe it's because the camera is so small it's hard to keep as stable as the larger Sony.

Video editing on a PC is equally easy on the Sony and Panasonic but the Panasonic's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with Sony's Digital 8. 

If you don't HAVE to record in miniDV format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera, I'd recommend buying an inexpensive Sony Digital8 for about a third of the price of the GS250. 

If you do have to have a miniDV camera and you won't be shooting in bright sunlight, try another brand.

This upper end 3CCD camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless I need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day. Otherwise, I'll use the old Sony so I can share the video I shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality
