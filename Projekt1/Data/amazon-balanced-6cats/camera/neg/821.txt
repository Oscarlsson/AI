I just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great.  But today I tried to turn it on and it's completely dead!  I even changed out the batteries and it's still completely dead.  This is the first digital camera I've had and I bought it because I'm going to Europe (two days after it died).  Now I have to scramble to get a replacement before I take off.  

Grrrrr!!
