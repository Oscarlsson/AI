I recommend NOT to purchase this item.  Look for another one.
The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  This would be great, except for two very important things.  One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving.  Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for
