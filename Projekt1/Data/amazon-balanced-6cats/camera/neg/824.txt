I bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak Z700. I  loved my Z700, even though it was only 4MP and didn't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have. I figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6MP would be a no-brainer, but I was disappointed in 2 major areas. First, the lag time is so slow on the C653, when I took pictures of my kids I rarely got what I was expecting to see. The smile or look that I saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures. We experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference. The other disappointing area was low-light picture quality. Anything I shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit. Every background was grainy. Terrible. Using the low-light settings fixed the problem, but then your subject is blurry because you're not in "Sports" or "Kids" mode anymore (which we used all the time with the Z700 for taking pics of the kids). On my Z700 (which is only $150 now), I could set it and forget it. Set it to "action", and it took perfect pics indoors, or out, moving or stationary. That's what I thought I was getting in the C653, but I was wrong. I ended up returning the camera
