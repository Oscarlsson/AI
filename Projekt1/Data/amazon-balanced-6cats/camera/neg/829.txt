I bought this lens in May for my brand new Rebel XT. I used it on a vacation mainly, and am pretty dissapointed. I'm no pro, or even skilled amateur, but I do know the lens is not giving me quality shots.

The autofocusing is slow, and af or manual shots aren't very sharp at any zoom. There seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me.

I wanted a good, all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types. I guess this would fit the bill, if it took sharp pictures. I wouldn't pay more than $150 for this lens again
