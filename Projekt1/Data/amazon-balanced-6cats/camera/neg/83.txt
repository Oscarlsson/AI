OK, maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose doesn't smudge the LCD screen as much.  The MOST annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera.  Both my 30D and Rebel XT.  If I am lucky enough it will fall off, get lost and eventually I will not be reminded I wasted money on this accesory
