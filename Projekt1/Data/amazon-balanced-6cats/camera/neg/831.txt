Me and my wife bought the JVC camcorder and burner set up to send dvd's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time. At first it worked great then after 2-3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc. We have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10. We returned it to get another and it did the same thing. WE thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal. I do not recommend this to anyone
