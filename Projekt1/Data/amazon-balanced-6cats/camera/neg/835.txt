Not seeing many reviews, I'm writing this as a warning. This mic is horrible. I bought it to get rid of the &quot;motor noise&quot; from my Canon Optura Pi, as many others have. When I listen now, the sound is much worse. You can barely hear people speak over the loud humming... THIS MIC IS HORRIBLE
