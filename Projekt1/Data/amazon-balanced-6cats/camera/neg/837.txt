I received this monitor as a baby shower gift, but it was something I had particularly wanted.  I was extremely disappointed when I found it didn't work at all!  There is so much sound interference it's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference.  We disconnected every electronic appliance in the house (cordless phone, microwave, even turned off our cell phones) and still the interference was there.  The video reception is awful, supposed to be up to 300 feet, we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible. I swear it was supposed to have "night vision" - forget it, non-existent.  I'm off the video monitoring; I'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor
