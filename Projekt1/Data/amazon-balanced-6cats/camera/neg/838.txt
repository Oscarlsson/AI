Because the camera eye moves only in one direction, the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby's bed. You have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib (older child can crawl away from the view) or see just a part of it. We have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad. We went with Graco's excellent digital iMonitor.
