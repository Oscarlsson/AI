This monitor worked pretty well for 4 months. We purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver. However, when we were downstairs (baby's room upstairs next to our's) the monitor was fuzzy, and had static and lines running thru. We were still able to have audio recpetion. After 4 months, the picture disappeared, audio was still operational. Not a good camera for long term
