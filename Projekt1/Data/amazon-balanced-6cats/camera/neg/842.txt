Review:
Unit had a very large defect in the field of view. It's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube; those I am aware of as I have other night vision devices. This goes about 1/4 of the way across, near the center. Had to return it. Poor quality control.

Update - the new one does not have any image defects. It also doesn't focus as sharply as the first one did (or my other one does), but it isn't too bad
