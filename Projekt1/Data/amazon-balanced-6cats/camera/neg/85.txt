Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this.  The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses.
