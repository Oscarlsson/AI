I was down in Antarctica when I turned on the camera and it said "lens error". After a day of missing some of the best pictures of Emperor Penguins with my 8800, I twisted the lens and got it to work. The same thing happened to me in Bolivia, just after the warranty expired. I called Nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera. Do a Google search of "lens error" and Nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience. This is my third and last Nikon
