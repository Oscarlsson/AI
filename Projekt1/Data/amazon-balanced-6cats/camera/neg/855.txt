When it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50% of the time if I was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher.  It seemed to become less effective each time I used it to the point that now I'm lucky to get a reading 10% of the time.  It still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless.
