Some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the Nikon 8400 has a "electronic viewfinder" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so I bought the camera.

The electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  Outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot. 

The "display" LCD monitor is small and washes out in sunlight.

The background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark.

After 3 days of use and 90 shots I mailed it back to "Ritz on Amazon" this morning, Dec 5.  They require it back "within 10 days of receipt of purchase", their "date of order" was Nov 29 and it arrived at my house on Dec 3.  It's a good thing I already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if I had waited for the one I ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  It cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a "delivery confirmation receipt".

The camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the "10 days" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what I was shooting I gave up on it
