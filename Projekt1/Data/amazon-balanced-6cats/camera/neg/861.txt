I ordered two of the items above in error.  I did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from Antonline.  I have been trying since Dec. 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them.  I am 71 years old and not computer savvy.  I just wish I could get return labels and my account credited.  They are still in the original packing as received and never been opened.  Thank you for being interested. I was informed by them that my time had expired.  I do not believe this to be true, or does your opening web page not apply to them.
