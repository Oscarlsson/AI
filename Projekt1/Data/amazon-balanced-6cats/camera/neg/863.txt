I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera.  It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera.  Unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original.  I would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original Nikon battery.  The price was cheap and you get what you pay for.  If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.  Cheers
