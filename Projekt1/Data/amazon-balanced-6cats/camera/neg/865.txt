I bought this over the Sony and I regret it.  I get a tape eject error every time I try to rewind.  I can only rewind at 10 second intervals before I get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again.  That's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape.  Many Canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired.  Canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item.  I will never buy Canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem
