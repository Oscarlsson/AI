My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1.
I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events.
The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony.
The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera.
However, beware of the rebate offer.
I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected.
The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code.
If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony
