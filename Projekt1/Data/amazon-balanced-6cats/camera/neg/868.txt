This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again
