I loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  I was using it one night and it died.  I went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  I would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine.
