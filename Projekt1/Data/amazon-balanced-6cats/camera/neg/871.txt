I had an older Canon camcorder that I was very happy with, so I decided to get this new one. I ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud. I even tried the same model at Best Buy to make sure it wasn't just a defective camera. But compared to a similar Sony model, the Canon was noticeably louder while operating. Way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions
