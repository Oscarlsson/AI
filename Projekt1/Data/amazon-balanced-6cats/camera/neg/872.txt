I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my "must-have" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian "New Reviewer", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??)

The plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  The joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  The wide screen viewfinder (LCD) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'.

I didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  The picture looked OK; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback.

In essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  Others watching and listening to the tape will not be
