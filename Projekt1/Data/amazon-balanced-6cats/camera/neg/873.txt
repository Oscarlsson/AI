I was attracted to the Cannon ZR800 due to the very small size and very low cost.  However, you get what you pay for, although you get much more in other brands for just a little increase in cost.  I've already returned my Cannon ZR800 and replaced it with the Sony DCR-HC38.  The smallest problem with the Canon is the continued motor noise, which you should be aware of it if you have read any review for any of the ZR800 predecessors.  The problem is that the motor is very loud, and you will hear a very annoying whirr if you are indoors.  This could be forgivable given the low cost, but the problem with the zoom noise is not.  When you zoom in and out, a very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go of the zoom switch.  It is a loud click and when you play back your video this click is amplified on your video.  It is impossible to watch a video and not notice this click.  It is annoying, unusual and a big flaw with these new ZR Cannon camcorders.  I called technical support, the person took a ZR800 and tried it out and then acknowledged that a problem does exist (she seemed stunned that this noise was occuring).  Bottom line, this camcorder is absolutely unusable due to this clicking noise and would not be worth using even if it were free.  Do not but it.

BTW, I love the Sony DCH-HC38 which is a bit more expensive and, like the ZR800, just recently came onto the market.
