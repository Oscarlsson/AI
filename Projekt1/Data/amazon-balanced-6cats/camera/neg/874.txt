I found the same problem that other users of this product experienced.  Particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot.  I found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash.  This leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated "flipping" of the flash that some other users have reported.  The item is manufactured by Stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called "Gadget Infinity" under the listing title of "Flash Bracket with 90 degrees Camera Rotate feature".  Buy it now price is $29.99.  I just bought one and it arrived yesterday and I could not be happier.  Pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years
