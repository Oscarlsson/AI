Pros: Great resolution. Nice packaging. Excellent door stop. 
Cons: Stopped working after 3 weeks. Horrible overall quality. No customer support what so ever since I didn't have a receipt (ebay purchase). 

Tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt, never got a response now I'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight.  Tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for $199.  Becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products.
