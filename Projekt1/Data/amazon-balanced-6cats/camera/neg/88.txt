It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards
