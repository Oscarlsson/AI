I can't say for sure that my experience was typical, but I can say that it was horrible.

The short version is:  I had to return it once for a screen failure, then I had to return the replacement for a screen failure (and a refund).

In between the returns, I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with customer support.  The manual was inadequate, especially for the wireless stuff.  I also had problems with Windows (Network Bridging, I think) that further complicated things.

For the brief time the two units worked, I was pleased.  The picture quality was good, and once running, I had no problems with the software.

I take a lot of digital photos.  This would have been the perfect compliment.

I gave the Memory Frame two stars (instead of one) because, in between failures and configuration problems, I was pleased with the quality of the display.

Too bad I couldn't say the same about the quality control.
