I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200.
