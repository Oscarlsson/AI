The EN-EL3a is a works fine and with no problems.  HOWEVER, AMAZON IS MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS BY PUTTING A LOWER PRICE FROM A PARTNER COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY PRICE OF THE ITEM.  Amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner.  The 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment
