Well. I was convinced the FX07 was a bad product after using it for 6 months. Like a lot of other reviews have pointed out, the noise level in low-light condition is annoying, and give you a watercolor-like effect. Some pictures I took during a visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium turned out completely dark (to prevent this beforehand, I even took photos of the same objects using several different settings, only to get the results of bad, worse, and worst). The picture quality is nowhere close to my old old old Sony cybershot T7. I was totally disappointed. If not for my T7 was broken, I wouldn't even wanna use this camera. Even re-sell it to other people, I would feel it's like a crime.

After revisiting this webpage and read more user reviews, I realized I must have got the defective item from Amazon. Well. What can I say? It's been 6 months. 

Bottom line: Just be careful when you received this item. Do some test shots. If anything looks suspicious, ask for a replacement. After all, all the high praise here can't be all wrong
