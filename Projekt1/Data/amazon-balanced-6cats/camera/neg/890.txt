I really like the size and weight of the camera.  It is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good.  I had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable.  I recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable, even outdoors.  All the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on.  I will spend a bit more money and get the Sony HCR-DC96 instead
