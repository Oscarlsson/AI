I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low.  You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black.  Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level!  What a disappointment.  I am going to try to return it
