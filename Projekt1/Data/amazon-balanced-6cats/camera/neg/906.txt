I just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the C743 camera.  The battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger.  I think it's odd, as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock.  I'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery.  I don't know whether the dock works okay, because I didn't get that far.  This is my second easyshare camera and dock and I was very happy with the first one.  Now I have to buy another battery
