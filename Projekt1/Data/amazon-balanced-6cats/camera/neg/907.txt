Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality
