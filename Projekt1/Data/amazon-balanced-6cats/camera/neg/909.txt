I bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it.  The price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels).  I did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a USB port but that is about all.  Overall don't waste your time and money
