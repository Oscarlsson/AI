Be careful ordering this item - make sure it's the right one for your camera.  While it says it's for the A95, it isn't.  While it doesn't say in the header that it's the LA-DC52C, it is, and the A95 camera requires the LA-DC52D.  I had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one.  I purchased the wrong one based on amazon's direction when purchasing accessories and don't want others to make the same mistake
