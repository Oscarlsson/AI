If you are looking to take high quality pictures, then look elsewhere. It is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you, but not much else. (Or for a beginner in photography or a child.) You have to hold very still if you don't want your pictures to come out blurry. Also, the flash makes images far too bright and if you don't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark.

The only thing I like about this camera is it's size. It's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag...

Anyway, I'm buying a better one soon
