We just bought this camera to replace our miniDV JVC-DVL500 that was bought in 2000. 

In short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is VERY grainy and dark. I applied the workaround listed above, but found that I had to set the frame rate to 1/15 in order to ge the brightness that I needed which caused a VERY jittery image. 

The quality of this camera is something that I would expect for $200, needless to say I am returning this camera today
