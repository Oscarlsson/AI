After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality.  I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a "snap shot" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR.
