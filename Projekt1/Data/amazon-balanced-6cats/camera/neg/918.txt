I purchased this case for my DSCS90. I hate it! It is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else. There is no handle to the case, in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle. The zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so I don't recommend doing this. Look for a better case for your new camera.
