I bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste.  The camera was much smaller than expected, trying to figure out what mode you're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret. Nothing is a simple "one step" procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children.  I was so frustrated setting it up that I didn't bother giving it to her.  The software installed okay but was also far from "kid friendly".  I wish I would've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase. Ironically, the reviews I did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids.  I believe you'd be better off purchasing a "regular" inexpensive digital camera for your potential "shutterbugs".
