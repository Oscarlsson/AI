At least if your going to decieve people about the LCD screen in the back, AT LEAST make the picture quality decent.  I mean this barely qualifies as a picture.  Some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light.  This was sickening to me because my daughter was excited and it broke her heart when I had to return it because she expected to at least be able to see the pictures.  

Definatly stay away from this camera
