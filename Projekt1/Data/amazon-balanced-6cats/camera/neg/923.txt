First, I want to defend this camera's lack of an LCD viewscreen--really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point.

What's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it doesn't do the one thing it NEEDS to do well--i.e., take a picture with the push of a button.

This product would be much better if you took out all the settings (what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera, for crying out loud?) and simply put in an auto-flash.  As it is, you must consult the manual, push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash (which is NOT intuitive, so you'll need to carry the manual with you), press the shutter button to turn the flash on, wait for the little red light to come on, and THEN you can take a picture.  Then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity, and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN!

Oh, and did I mention that it won't take a picture if there isn't enough light (there wasn't even in the brightest room in my house), so you MUST use the flash?

Clearly, the makers of this product did not test it on real children.  Heck, MY digital camera is easier to use than this!  We never even got to see the picture quality--after trying to get it to even take a picture, I knew this was going back to the store ASAP
