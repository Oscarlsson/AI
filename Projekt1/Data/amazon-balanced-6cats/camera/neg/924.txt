This was a waste of money.  My 5 year old loves taking photos.  She uses my digital camera  sometimes.    I  thought this would be a great gift for  her.  She could  see the photos on the back of the camera like  mom's.  This was not the case.   The LCD does not  project the images  and it is so small  you  can not read what mode you are in. If the batteries run  out, it erases the  photos. I think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly.  My daughter  was frustrated  quickly and  it has laid  in  the  drawer  for 3  months.
If your child  likes to take  photos, I would invest in something  else
