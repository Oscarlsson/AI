Overall, I was entirely disappointed with this camaera.  The packaging and description were deceiving.  There was no view finding screen, only a teeny, tiny window as in a regular camera.  This was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera.  I bought it because I wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen.  The construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE
