I ORDERED THIS ITEM ABOUT A MONTH AGO...I GOT THE PACKAGE IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND WAS SO EXCITED TO OPEN IT I WAS LIKE A 10 YEAR OLD WHO JUST GOT THEIR FIRST BIKE!...I OPENED THE PACKAGE TO ONLY FIND A THE CHARGER FOR THE CAMERA...YES...ONLY THE CHARGER...NO CAMERA TO BE FOUND IN THE PACKAGE!!!!!...I WAS SO PISSED I CALLED AMAZON AND ASKED THEM WHERE THE HELL IS MY CAMERA...AND THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID "OH IM SORRY...WE PROBABLY FORGOT TO PUT IT INTO THE PACKAGE" ...WHAT KIND OF @#$%@#$@#$% IS THAT...SO I ASKED THE GUY TO SHIP ME A CAMERA...AND TO MY LUCK THEIR WERE NO MORE IN STOCK...SO I TOLD THE GUY TO FORGET IT AND FOR HIM TO SEND ME A RETURN SLIP SO THAT I CAN GET MY FULL $220 DOLLARS BACK BECAUSE OF YOUR HORRIBLE/TERRIBLE/RIDICULOUS SERVICE. IT IS NOW FEB AND STILL NO MONEY BACK...I KEEP CALLING THEM AND THEY SAY THE RETURNED PACKAGE IS STILL IN TRANSIT....IVE NEVER HEARD OF A PACKAGE TAKING OVER A MONTH TO GET TO ITS DESTINATION...BUT I COULD BE WRONG RIGHT? I WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF I NEVER SEE MY 200 DOLLARS AGAIN...IF I WANTED TO WASTE 200 DOLLARS LIKE THAT I COULD HAVE FLUSHED THEM DOWN THE TOILET....WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!...IT WAS AN AMAZON VENDOR AS WELL...@#$%@#%$@#q^@#$^@#$%#$$%^@...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!
