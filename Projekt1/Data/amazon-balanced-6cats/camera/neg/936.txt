This microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the Sony HDR-HC7 video camera on most websites, including SonyStyle.  While the microphone may be of good quality (I didn't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it), it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the HDR-HC7.  The microphone does plug into the MIC jack on the camera and appears to work, but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera.  (Note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back, at which point it's probably too late to make a correction.)  After nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and, finally, direct conversation with a Sony Technician, I learned that there is a "jury-rigged" bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod.  Otherwise, there is no way to fix it to the camera.  The Sony technician finally admitted that it was " curious" that Sony lists this as a compatible microphone.  If you have a Sony HDR-HC7, CHOOSE A DIFFERENT MICROPHONE!
