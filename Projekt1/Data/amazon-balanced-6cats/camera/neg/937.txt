I ordered this mic after having to return the ECMHS1 (because it was, in reality, totally non-directional).  Well, this one actually IS directional, but it is such a pain to use I wish I never bought it.

1st of all, you should know this mic does not work with the "smart shoe" available on most Sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe.  Therefore it is battery powered.  This may seem like a minor problem, but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video, otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery.  Believe me, at some point you WILL forget this.

Not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it isn't in the way.  (In my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use.)

(As you might expect, I highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible.  Of course, that means the mic doesn't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe.  It's a great feature.)

Finally, while the engineers at Sony have done some amazing things over the years, they weren't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic's battery.  This cap will fall off with even the slightest touch.  This can be INCREDIBLY annoying.  Mine fell off several times - fortunately I always managed to find it.  I finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it (doesn't look great, but at least the color matches).

Considering the high cost, this mic is a really bad investment.  While the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic, this is a VERY poor substitute.
