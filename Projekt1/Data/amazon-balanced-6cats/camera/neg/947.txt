I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos.

It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.

Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month.
