I received this as a Christmas present.  This digital camera works fine for still shots, pictures of my family, etc, but for action shots, kids playing outside, basketball games, etc. it is a BIG disappointment.  I took 47 pictures of my son playing basketball in our school gym and only 5 of them were worth keeping. I've taken to several games/activities to try it out. I've tried using the different functions, adjusting the manual setting, and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked.  Many of the shots are blurred, have shadows (because of movement), or are so dark the people can't be seen.  I wish I would have known this before I asked for this camera.
