I got this lens in a kit with a Nikon D80 camera.  This lens failed to deliver the goods 99% of the time.  Why buy an expensive camera and then use a cheap lens like this?  Its silly to spend big money on the camera and have only blurry pictures to show from it.  It was only tolerable in very bright situations and using less than 100mm focal length.  A cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints.  Very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom (200mm).  I disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera (D200) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 VR lens from Nikon.  

If your interested in nice sharp pics, then pass on this lens.  If you want to save a few bucks and like blurry photos, this lens is for you..
