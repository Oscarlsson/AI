This adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my A700, so much so 
that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical
to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens.
Thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter. Canon, normally a
responsible firm with many excellent products, is beneath contempt in marketing
this lens.  I called Canon customer service and spoke with a sympathetic
representative who took the matter up with "someone else".  The outcome was that
they admit that there "is very little increase" in the non-vignetted field of view
by using this adapter.  She said she would put my comments on a company-internal
problem compilation called "customer voice".  I can only hope it reaches someone
high enough to do some good
