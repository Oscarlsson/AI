After receiving the case and trying to use it on the camera, I discovered it was very cumbersome and almost impossible to manipulate.  For instance, you cannot access the CF card or camera with the attached portion screwed into the tripod mount, Also, taking the front cover off to take a picture was a hassle.  This is not useable for a carry-around use.

I have it sitting in the corner of my office unused, spent good money for nothing.
