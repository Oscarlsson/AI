Bought this case along with a Digital Rebel XTi, my first SLR. Instead of the 18-55mm kit lens I opted for the Sigma 17-70mm lens. Sad to say, but the case fits only with the kit lens.. The Rebel XTi with the 17-70mm lens barely fits.

So a word of cuation to everyone, if you're planning on anything other than the kit lens, then don't get this
