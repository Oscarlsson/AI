I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5.

I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.

However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: 
(1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called "red-eye reduction" setting does nothing.
(2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible.

These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above.

Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else.

Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras).
