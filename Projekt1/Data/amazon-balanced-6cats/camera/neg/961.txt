After discovering that the makers of a great camera would only offer such an inferior case, I did some more looking.  What I ended up with was a Pelican case.  For those not familiar with these cases stop by any camera/photo shop, and they most likely carry them.  They come in many sizes and are simply an airtight, waterproof high impact plastic case with very snug fitting latches.  The inside is solid soft foam that you &quot;pluck&quot; to fit what ever you want to store in the case.  I purchased the 1300 for my Finepix 3800.  The case easily holds the camera, battery charger, mini tripod, and 3 XD cards.  They come in 4 or 5 colors, and can be used for almost anything you want to protect from damage
