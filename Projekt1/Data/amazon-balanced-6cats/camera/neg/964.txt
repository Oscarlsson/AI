I was completely fooled.  Twice.  My fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for Christmas.  So as I slowly open the box, I see a pair of socks on top.  There was more underneath, so I start opening it further and there is a camera case, a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box, the HP Photosmart M525 Digital Camera!  I was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own.  No more borrowing from my sister when I needed to snap a few pictures.  I put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures.  To put it bluntly, UGH!!!  The first thing that I noticed is that, even in best picture mode, the pictures were a little blurry/grainy even in the best of lighting conditions.  The second thing that I noticed is that the pictures are distorted.  There's a slight fisheye effect (Imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door.) which is quite annoying.  I talked to HP Support (Someone who spoke very poor english I might add.  What is the deal with that?) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model.  Guess what?  Same problem!  So after talking to HP once again, I am returning this one and getting a different brand.  This is a horrible product. My sisters Kodak that I bought 3 years ago is a far superior product.  I am very disappointed.  HP needs to put out a better product, and have some customer support reps that speak better english.  It gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood
