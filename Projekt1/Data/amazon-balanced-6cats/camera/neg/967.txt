There is currently a known issue with many of the Sony Camcorders.  This is being called the "black screen of death".

What happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the CCD goes out like a light.  The camera will not take video again.

Sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support.  The fact is Sony does not stand behind their product.  If this happens to you, Sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars.

There is a lengthy thread on CNET on this issue.  Search for Sony black screen.

Wishing you luck in the purchase of your (not Sony) video camera,
Scot
