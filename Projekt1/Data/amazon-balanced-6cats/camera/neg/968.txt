If you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the Xacti HD1A, you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash. The adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos.

It does work well for video. The Sanyo Xacti HD1A camera itself is a disappointment
