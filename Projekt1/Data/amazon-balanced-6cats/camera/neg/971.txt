We never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new.  And one day, the lens just won't open.  It lights up then after a few seconds, it turns off automatically.  Called a up a Kodak Service center and they gave me a quote for repair.

The price they've given me is close to my purchase price here in Amazon!

I'll never buy a Kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs.  I do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point.  So I'm expecting a believable quote for repairs.

I think Kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera
