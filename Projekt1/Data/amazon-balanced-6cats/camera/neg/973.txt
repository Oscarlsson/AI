I made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely. The lens is for a variety of Canon cameras but the adapter only works with the A6XX series. My adapter arrived and it doesn't work with my camera. Kinda misleading and now I have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately. Bummer.

Also, Captain Jack is correct about the vignetting. This lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens. If you zoom wide angle, you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned. If you stay zoomed in, it works ok. Disappointing
