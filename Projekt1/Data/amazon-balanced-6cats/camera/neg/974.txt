I bought this lens for my Canon PowerShot G5, and because it requires the use of a long adapter, not only does it cause terrible vignetting (that circle the other poster thought was cool, but which is actually a design flaw) unless you zoom most of the way, it blocks the built-in flash. I have owned four Canon cameras over the past 15 years, and the G5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment. (I would have bought the digital Rebel when it first came out so I could use my EOS lenses, but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation (insane for a $1000 camera body).)

I do not recommend this lens or any of the G-series digital cameras from Canon. When I've got the money I'll be buying the latest digital Rebel and upgrading some of my old EOS lenses, and selling my entire PowerShot kit. If you are an experienced photographer, you will not like this system at all
