I feel that it is just way too much money for what you get. I own a lot of professional (Canon) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there. But it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price.

I have the S80. No complaint there. The leather case was just way too tight, which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera. The flap issue is an issue. The neck chain is a bit short, and similar and better items can be had for a lower price. If you shop around you can also find the Li battery for less.

I'm not upset, but just disappointed with what I got for the price
