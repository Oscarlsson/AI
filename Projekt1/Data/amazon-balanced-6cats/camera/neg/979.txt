This was my second camcorder- after a Canon that lasted 2 years but developed motor noise. This Panasonic literally suddenly died after only 3 MONTHS ( well, 3 months and a week- thereby a week too late for the warranty and a "too bad, so sad" response from panasonic!). I had used it to film a wedding- it had terrible indoor quality and poor sound quality and obviously had a short pathetic lifespan. Do not buy this camera
