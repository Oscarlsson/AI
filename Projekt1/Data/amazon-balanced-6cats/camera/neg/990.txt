Decent camera, but not great.  Shark mode is nice.  Housing looks good, but mine leaked at ~20 ft...camera was dead by the time I got it out of the water.  Good news is that Amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week.  Net result was one decent picture and a disappointing Christmas present.  Next time I will buy a housing for a better camera.  Canon has some nice ones
