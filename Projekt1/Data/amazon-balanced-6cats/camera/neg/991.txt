If you are going to lay out $500 for a camera, you should expect a fair amount of camera.

However, I have a few gripes here.  First, there is no remote control for it which makes setting up a shot tough.  All the Nikons in the D series can use a wireless remote.  You can buy an underwater case for those magnificent Nikons so you can shoot underwater.  You can get over 10 megapixels in a D80, or D200 and you get that great Nikkor lens.  You don't get much of a lens on the DC500, and 5 megapixels don't get you very far when it comes to printing and publication quality images.  Lets face it: this is an expensive point-n-shoot camera for a tourist, not a serious camera.

Nuff said.
