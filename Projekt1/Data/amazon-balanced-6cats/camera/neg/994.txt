Sure my Canon sd-30 is super cute and I get lots of compliments on how small and sexy it is, but heaven forbid you want to take pictures with it!!

This camera cannot take pictures in low light AT ALL!  Every picture I've taken at parties has been out of focus, which adds up to a lot of hazy photos of great memories.  I took it back to the camera shop and the guy said I had the setting right but "yeah, they don't work well in low light."  Well if I needed a bright sunny day for every shot I could make a pinhole camera out of a cardboard box!

The pictures it takes in daylight are nice.  But anyone who wants a tiny little camera like this is planning on putting it in their pocket and taking it to parties!

I got the Sony Cybershot 10.1 and it takes GREAT pictures in low light.   Later, Canon.
