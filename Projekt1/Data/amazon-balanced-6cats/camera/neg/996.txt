Bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot. With extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it. The velcro does not  hold it closed well either. My memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes , Thank goodness my husband noticed
