This battery is backwards compatible with the D50, D70/70s, and is used in the D80 and D200.  So if you have any Nikon DSLR and want a second battery, you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery.

This battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery, and it is accurate.  This is a big deal; *if you are using the D200 or D80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up.  This is the first battery I've seen that is accurate in this regard.  Kudos to Nikon. (This feature does not work in the D50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine)
