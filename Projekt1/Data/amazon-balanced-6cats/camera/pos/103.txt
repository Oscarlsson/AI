This monopod does a great job for my camera. You have the quick, easy-off, it attatches to your camera by a screw, and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly. I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy it again. Nice product
