I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon.  Having read the customer reviews, I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS.  Three shots each at f-stops 5.6, 11, and 20, one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200.  Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera, highest jpeg setting. After shooting both series, I compared them fresh out of the camera, side by side.  Results:  the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances.  It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20, (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10), and at 20, it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background.  The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise.  Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop.  There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results.  My conservative conclusion:  the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it), and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage.  Between these lenses, its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. Both lenses focus quickly and silently, and both lenses produce usable shots.
