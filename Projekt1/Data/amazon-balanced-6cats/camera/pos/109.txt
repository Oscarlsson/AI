I've bought several lenses from Adorama, two of which include a new 300/2.8 IS and the other, this 500/4 IS. All of their deliveries were prompt and well packed. I have zero complaints with them. I dealt the John (Green, I think is his last name) via email. I highly recommend them.

As for this lens, it is incredible. Wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background (good bokeh). AF is very fast. This lens is extremely good and will still AF when used with the 1.4x converter. (AF works up to f5.6.
