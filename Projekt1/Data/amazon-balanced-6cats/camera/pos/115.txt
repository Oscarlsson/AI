It's a pretty convinient bag.I put a Canon rebel XT with a Tamron 28-75 lens,a Canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and I still have the small pocket for wallet,keys etc.
The only drawback of this bag is,you can not put in big lenses.The Canon 70-300 is the limit.But if you only have a limited gear collection,you need to give it a try
