I have had this bag for a year and recommend it.  I use it all the time.  It's a great walkaround bag.  The first time you're in a place where you want to get to your camera quickly or don't want to put your bag down you'll appreciate the sling design.  Just be aware for a long mountain hike you may feel the weight on your shoulder after some time.

My only error was getting the 100 - I should have gone with the 200, and plan to do so.  I like to keep my lens hood in place which requires a little more room.  I'd also found that I need a little more room for non-camera things.

A word on the all-weather cover - a great feature.  A few weeks ago I was in Bermuda and walked to a beach about 25 minutes away.  Just as I arrived a soaking rain began that didn't let up for the entire walk back.  If I hadn't been able to pull on the cover my equipment would have been soaked.  Now I wouldn't buy a bag without one
