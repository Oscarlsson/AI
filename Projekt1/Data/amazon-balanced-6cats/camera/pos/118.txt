I just got back from vacation. I have a bad back, and it was sore. I was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs, I could carry my Nikon D-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably. 

Gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses.

I have other bags which heft lots of gear, and they're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot, but if you're looking to hike (and have a separate way to carry a tripod), then this is a wonderful bag
