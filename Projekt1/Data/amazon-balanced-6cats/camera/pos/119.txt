Got the Lowero SlingShot 100 about 2 months ago, and it is really coming in handy.  In the main area, it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted, 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens (80-320mm), plus a Sigma EF-500 Super flash.  It's packed in there, and the flash just barely fits, but i don't need much more room.  The top compartment holds extra batteries, recharger, etc.  Really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back...just by pulling the case to my front (no need to take it off my back).  Well made.  Zippers are strong so I don't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out.  Perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer.
