This is a good, affordable UV filter for protecting your expensive lenses.  I leave it on my lens all the time.  This particular filter (L-39 Sharp Cut) is especially good for wide angle lenses (&lt; 24mm focal length), because of its ultrathin profile, which prevents vignetting.  I have used regular filters on wide angle lenses, with very bad results.  Although this filter is NOT multi-coated, I have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures I've taken.  Multi-coated UV filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one, which I don't think is worthwhile.  All in all, I recommend this filter for Canon or non-Canon lenses
