I use it with my Nikon D70, and am very satisfied with it.
I most often use it for long exposures, for taking picture that include myself, and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter, who stops acting naturally when she notices I hold the camera, so I place it on the tripod, and take pictures of her.
