If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip.

I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy.

I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one
