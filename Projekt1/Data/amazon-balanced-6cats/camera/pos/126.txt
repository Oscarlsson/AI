First of all I do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! So I will not go into anything technical.  I will leave that to people who know more than I do. But what I am is an international traveler.  I simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with "snapshots".  I wanted someting much better, and boy did I get it with this camera.  I looked at the D70s and since I have very small hands, I could never feel comfortable holding it.  This camera is smaller without being small.  I have only taken photos locally, but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start.  The built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than "point and shoot" snap shots
