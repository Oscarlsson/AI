I am certainly happy I bought this filter kit. For a starting photographer, the price was right, and I have not noticed any quality issues. The UV filter stays on a lens at all times, as it's cheaper to replace the filter, than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired. 

The light polarizer is very handy, and also works very well, cutting down greatly on glare.

I have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet. 

The filter case is a nice extra, it fits right in my camera bag, and is out of the way untill I need it
