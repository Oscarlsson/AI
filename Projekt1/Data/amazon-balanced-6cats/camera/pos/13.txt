This is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other Canon flash units. You can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation. It does what it suppose to. I used it with the 420EX I've had for several years and it worked fine. Mounted on the camera it's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power. Thinking of the 430EX? Cough up the few extra bucks for this baby, you'll be glad you did. It's a one shot deal, [no pun intended], you'll be using it for years to come. I bought the 420EX for my Elan II E about 6 years ago. It's been a great unit. This one recharges  faster and has gobs more power. You'll love it! Don't let all the dials and switches scare you, read the instruction manual
