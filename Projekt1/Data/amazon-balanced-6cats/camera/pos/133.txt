Well, I've had my Rebel Xti for about 6weeks now, and all i can say is wow!!! I did have the Rebel Xt, which was an awesome camera.  I'm not a professional, but i do take pictures of what ever it may be outside or inside, youth or adult events as a hobby.  This camera is not for the person who wants to just point and shoot or to have a camera to stuff in your pocket.  This camera is for the creative person who wants control of the pictures they are taking.  The sensor cleaner and wide LCD are just a few of the wonderful advances from the XT to the XTI. The camera for me is easy to use and takes great pictures in auto mode or in my mode. 
I hope this helps you in your decision whether to buy or not.
