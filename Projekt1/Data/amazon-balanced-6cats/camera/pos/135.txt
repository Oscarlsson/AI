Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: "that is it, nothing to do on it!" ??

And it wasn't just the sky. Any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks.

With this blower, greatly priced (pity that Adorama doesn't have free shipping though), I put my camera on the tripod, pointed it down, squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs!!!

Great buy for DSLR owners
