Im a graphic design student in college, so i really needed a camera. I decided on this one and i am really glad i did. The pictures are nice and clean. The camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact. The only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick, but i just took them out when i wasnt using them. Buy this camera
