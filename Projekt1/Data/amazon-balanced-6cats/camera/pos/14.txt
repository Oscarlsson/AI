I didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. I've used it now on several occasions with my Canon 5D and couldn't be happier with it. It's great for shooting portraits. I can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up. I would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get's rid of the typical flash harsh light
