This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time.
Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it.
Ease-of-use- Great.
Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files.
Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time
