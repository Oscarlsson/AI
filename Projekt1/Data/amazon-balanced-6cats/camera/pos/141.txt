After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.

I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal. 

Amazon delivered by UPS in record time even with a weekend inbetween. I ordered on a Friday and received it the following Tuesday. Go with Amazon!
