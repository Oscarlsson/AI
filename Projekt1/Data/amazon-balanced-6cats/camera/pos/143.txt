For its time and price (at the time), a fantastic camera.  6.3 MP is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work, and this camera works very well with what really matters:  Canon's fantastic lenses.  Battery life on this camera is very good.  The "shutter lag" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format.  As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses.  But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography.

My one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings.  When I shoot RAW this isn't such a big problem, because I can fix it in Photoshop, but most everything I shoot inside, unless I manually mess with the white balance every time, has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots, and then is annoying after.  I think the more advanced EOS models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem, and also help a bit with the lag between the RAW shots...but for the money, this camera is excellent, and far, far superior to, for example, Olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price).  The difference, as far as I'm concerned, is in the absolute advantage Canon has in lens quality.  You can use a high-end consumer body like this one, use a professional piece of Canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos.  I wouldn't invest in a system that doesn't also boast excellent lens quality
