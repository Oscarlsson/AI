I highly recommend the Raynox DCR 1540Pro Teleconverter for the Canon S2 instead of the Canon branded one.   Hoya makes a 67mm UV filter for this and both are available at Lensmate.com.   The Canon WC-DC58A wide angle converter however is really good.  Tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore.   
By the way, the function that the S2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the AutoFocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which, in my mind, because of the LCD both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder, is iffy at best.   Trust the camera.....it really does an excellent job.   One final note, I would recommend using the Focus Bracketing option in lower light situations as the Auto Focus is weak in those situations.
