I'm still learning to use this camera and all the features. So far it is amazing. I've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots. I use the auto mode a lot and it works great. The zoom is amazing. I love that it tells me when I am focused. Also it has great battery life. I'm very happy with this camera
