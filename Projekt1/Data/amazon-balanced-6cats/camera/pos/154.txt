The previous review is not completely correct. The problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon.com put up for the Canon CPM-E3 Battery Magazine. It is a battery magazine for the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3 and not for the camera battery grip. I think the product itself is a great thing, it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3.
The previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer
