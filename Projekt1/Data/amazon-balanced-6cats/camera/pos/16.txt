I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences
