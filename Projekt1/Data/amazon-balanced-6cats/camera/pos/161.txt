I bought the 250D lens to use with my Sony DSC-F717 and it is just wonderful. I can also use it with my Canon G3 because I bought a Canon LADC58B Conversion Lens Adapter (which is required and is inexpensive). 

I had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and I have seen many wonderful examples of its use. 

I recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their "macro" photography shine. Get one! 

Just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and don't be confused as to which one will fit your camera.

Edit: 

Just a clarification: 

This one 'is' the "58mm" even though above (on this page) when you click the links "See More Technical Details" and "See all Product Description" it mentions "52mm". This is misleading and confusing. At the very very top of this page it says "58mm". Let me just assure you that this particular one 'is' the "58mm" and 'is not' the "52mm".

late edit (Aug 04, 06):
Well, it looks as if Amazon finally corrected that misleading info I mentioned just above in my clarification
