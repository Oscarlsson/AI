This is just a plain sweetheart of a lens.  It covers the useful 18-35 mm range (which is 27-52mm on a Nikon digital SLR, which is a VERY useful range).  This lens costs less than half the price of the (expensive) professional Nikon 17-35, and does almost as nice a job. Sufficiently nice, in fact, that most amateurs will not discern much, if any, difference.   While not built like a tank, I think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent, and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros.

On a Nikon digital SLR, which will use the center portion of this lens (due to the size of the sensor in the SLR) you can expect excellent, even spectacular results.  This is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots, portraits, or just plain walking around taking pictures.  Someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent, versatile lens.  This one is great for parties, vacations, and the works.

The images I have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast, are very sharp, and have beautiful color rendition.  There just is not a lot not to like about this lens. I give it 4 stars for overall performance, but 5 stars for value and price/performance.  Some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers.  This is one of those
