This is the first SLR camera that I have ever owned.  I bought it because I was going on a trip around the world, wanted a nice camera, and had it recommended by a camera shop owner.   It is extremely easy to use, so easy that I could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries I visited, point to the button they needed to push and I ended up with a great picture.  I didn't need to explain a thing.  I also didn't mind carrying it around all day, it is very light for its size.  

 I have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures.  I have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera, from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great.  The action shots are never blurry!  The only complaint that I have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting, sometimes it is slow and sometimes it won't work at all.  In these cases I just turn on the manual focus option.

All the options that the camera has are great, but to be honest I rarely use them.  I've found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center.  If I know that I'm going to be taking action shots or landscapes I will set the camera to that mode, but often I forget and my pictures still look great.

I think that this is an excellent camera, especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a SLR camera can give them.  There are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses, so when the photography bug gets you, this camera can stay with you
