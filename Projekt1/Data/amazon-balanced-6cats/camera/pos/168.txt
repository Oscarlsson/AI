The Canon RS-60E3 is all that Canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash, focus, then release the shutter once, a multiple of times, or hold it open for bulb exposure.  Although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture, it was simple enough to make an "extension" that allows for very remote exposures
