The fisheye lens is a lot of fun, and I enjoy using mine.  However, I find that the practicality of the lens is minimal.  I don't usually want my "serious" photographs to have fisheye distortion.

I don't tend to like the 1.6x crop on Canon's lower-end digital SLR cameras, but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit:  it's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens, since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop.  You can still get distortion, but it's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera.

Either way, lots of fun.  Buy one for the enjoyment, or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it, but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these
