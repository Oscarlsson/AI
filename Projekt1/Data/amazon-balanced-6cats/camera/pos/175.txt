Though the lenses for my Nikon D50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this UV Protection Filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense. I feel less stress when I clean the filter lens than if I was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass. This size, 52mm, was what was specified for my D50 and it fits perfectly, as it should. I have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller. If you are new to digital SLR's like I was then get this filter to protect your lens. And spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens.
