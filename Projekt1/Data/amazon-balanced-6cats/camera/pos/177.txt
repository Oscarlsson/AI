If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the "Last 4" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active "picture happy" family
