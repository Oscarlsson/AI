I have been using my Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1MP for about a month now. It's so easy to use.  And, I love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen.  The only issue I have with it, is that I can't use the Memory Pro Stick with my Sony photo printer (a 5 year old model), because the stick is not compatible. 

ps: don't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera. you're gonna need it.
