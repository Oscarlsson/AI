I will not repeat what other reviews have stated already, all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc.

The only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a Rolex watch.  It is HARD even in Manual mode (and I actually have alot of digital camera experience).  Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress.  

If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one!  This Fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people, cars, buildings, sites, etc
