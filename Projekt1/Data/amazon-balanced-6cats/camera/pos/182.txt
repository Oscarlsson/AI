 The black of this is the same as on my camera, and with all the parts together, this is one professional looking set up!
 I am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection, as I have not used it on a sunny day, but I don't see why it shouldn't.
 And as cheap as this little product is, it is pretty much a must have with this camera! (S3 IS)

 One last side note, should you alreay own a extra lens or two. And they happen to be metal, be VERY carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor! I made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour, so the metal would shrink, and I could get the pieces apart
