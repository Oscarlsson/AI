I bought this camera for my sister, as an early Christmas present, thinking I would need some time to set it up for her, well in less then 30 minutes I was ready, It's a awesome camera, I was impressed, of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 SD card. I have sent the site to another sister whom is interested. It is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone, Great photos from very close to far away. I would recommend this camera to anyone
