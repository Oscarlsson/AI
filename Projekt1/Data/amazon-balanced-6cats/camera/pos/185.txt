Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing.  I'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this, I am having fun!  It amazes me that Canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price.  

I just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing--so clear and the colors are very vibrant.  Just to let you know, I'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens.  I took the suggestions of many and passed up on the "kit" lens and I'm sure glad I did so.  I would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens, but unfortunately for the rest of you, Amazon has discontinued it.  But you could order it from one of the many other photo shops (B&H, Adorama, etc). 

Do I have any regrets on this purchase?  Absolutely not!  I love this camera and even though I've owned it for less than a month, I'm actually thinking about stepping up to the EOS 3 and using this as a backpacking/hiking body.  Hmm...what to do, what to do?  Do I purchase another body or start a collection of L-series glass?  ...that is the question.
