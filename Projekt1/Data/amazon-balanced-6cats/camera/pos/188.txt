The other day I used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. The whole time I found myself missing the manual zoom, instant response and convient manual buttons on my D50. This camera takes amazing pictures. As an dSLR beginner I used the camera in Auto mode for the first several weeks, now after reading some books on photography I'm slowing starting to use the manual features. The D50 lets me choose the level of control that I'm comfortable with, from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away.

The body of this camera is built like a tank. Metal and high quality plastics abound. The buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable. It is a beautiful piece of precision engineering
