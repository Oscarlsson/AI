Not much to add to the other positive reviews posted, other than I am another user that loves my D50. Have had it for a year now and shot over 10,000 photos with excellent results (mostly landscape and wildlife).  Excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands.
The only CON I can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel - this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low/ no light situations. Also, for people that are used to the little compact point & shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around (which is why I have a little pocket camera for my purse). I also got the 18-200 lens and love it - perfect walk around lens
