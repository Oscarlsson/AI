This, in my very humble opinion, is the most useful, the sharpest, and just about anything else good you can think of say, best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lightning fast and that's what you want when the light is low.

My gal pal Sara and I have often wandered the Caribbean islands in the dawn's early light, as she is into shooting old homes. She particularly likes the gingerbread homes in Marigot, on the French side of St. Martin. I swear she must have them all on her hard drive. It's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion, feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light.

She just loves it and since I love her, I gotta love it too. Seriously though, I've used the lense quite a bit myself and it's a keeper if ever there was one. You just go wrong with a Canon "L" lense, no siree.
