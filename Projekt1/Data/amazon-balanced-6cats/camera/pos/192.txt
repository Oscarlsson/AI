Although this is a good batch of accessories, the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times.  It has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top.  So, if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture, you must open the case, pull the camera's strap through the slit, then lift the camera out.  It would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy
