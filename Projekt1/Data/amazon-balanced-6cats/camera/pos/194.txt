Now that i have had this on my camera for a while now, my camera feels so weird with it off, i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to. I wish the buttons were the same plastic/chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain
