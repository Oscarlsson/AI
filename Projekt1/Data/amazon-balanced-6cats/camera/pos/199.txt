Be careful when you use this lens because it does not have IS (image stabilizer) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur. This is why the lens is so cheap. This is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens. If you are really zoomed in and it's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case. This goes for any lens, but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod. 

It's common sense, but I've loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards
