When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them
