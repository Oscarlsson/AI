This is the same charger came with my digital rebel, however, I like to charge two batteries at a time. So, I bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip. 

The prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact, flat and easy to take along with you. It's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with.
