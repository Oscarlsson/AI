I am THRILLED with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does.  I test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that I like so well.

Well, it did great as it came but I found that I wanted to have the 1/1 capability so I bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up.  I like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what I like to specialize in.  This lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away.  I built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better.  (Works great, btw).

As usual, it's great Canon glass that does the trick
