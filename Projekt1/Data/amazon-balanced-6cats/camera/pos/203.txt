I purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches.  I use an original Canon Digital Rebel and the shots are really very detailed.  It is easy to use in fact, I can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches.  Its F2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge.  If you own a Canon digital SLR and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you.
