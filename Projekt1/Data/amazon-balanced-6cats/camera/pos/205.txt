I have used this charger & battery package for a while now in my digital SLR, battery performance is excellent! The downside is that the charger has issues: The top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get VERY hot when charging, it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year I have had them. If you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these, and the charger is okay, just beware that it does not charge all NiMH batteries but does do most
