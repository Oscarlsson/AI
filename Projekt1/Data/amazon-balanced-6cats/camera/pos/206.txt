I don't have that much stuff, but fits all my DSLR gadgets plus my camcorder.

Fits 
- my Canon Xti with my canon 50 mm attached.
- my kit lens
- my new canon 70-300 IS
- my panasonic video cam
- minor accessories (extra batteries, cables, memory cards, etc)

There are separators with velcros inside, so you can configure the bag however you want it.

The only issue I have with this bag is that I wan't able to configure it to store my Xti with my 70-300 attached
