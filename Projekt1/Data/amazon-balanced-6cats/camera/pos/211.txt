Purchased a printer dock and camera bundle, from a local office supply store for $100. It only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge, so I purchsed this from amazon. Amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping. It works great. No complaints. The paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that I still use for some pictures, but works well for my classroom, to give to my students. The pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them
