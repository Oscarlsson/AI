Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market.  But it is a solid, reliable card.  The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card.  However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd.  A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images.  scary.  However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT.  I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT
