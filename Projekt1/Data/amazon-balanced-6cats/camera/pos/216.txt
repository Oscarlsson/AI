"Wow!" is all I can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40.  I've been using Nikon manual-focus Nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness.  However, after using the Canon "L" series, I've sold a lot of my Nikkors.  The color, clarity, sharpness, and detail of the "L" lenses are amazing.  The prints have this 3-D effect (without having to use those silly red/blue glasses!) 8-)  Within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40, I ordered the 70-200.  Those two lenses will replace my whole Nikkor collection.  Build is really good.  The "L" zooms are a little bulkier, but very managable.  The Nikkors are smaller, but very heavy.  But lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years, I can see the difference.  I tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun.  The 17-40 surprising handles flare very well.  With the sun just outside the field of view, there was very little flare and loss of contrast.  I also make 12x18 prints, and this lens handles them easily.  The body is going to be the limiting factor (refering to digital bodies).
Warning: once you use "L" glass, you are going to be spoiled.  You may not settle for consumer lenses anymore, although some non-L lenses are quick good from what I read
