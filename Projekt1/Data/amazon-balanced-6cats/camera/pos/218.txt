Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.
