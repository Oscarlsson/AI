I like using a tripod with my long zoom lens, and this device has really added to my hobby.  The remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard.  I personally don't like cables, I don't like dealing with them.  This is just right for my purposes.

The remote is also better for taking pics of people.  It is much better than a timer in my opinion since I can move people in and out easier and more efficiently, taking pictures more quickly.  This gives me so much more control than using a timer.
