I bought this flash to use on my Canon Rebel XT. The first thing I noticed was that without even reading the instructions I was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors. Being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash. Even when I set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down. It did not need anytime to recharge at all.
I recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots. Most of the pictures came back with great results. The only dissappointment I have is that when taking shots from further distance than I normally would, the pictures came back darker than I would've liked. So, to compensate for this I adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right.
Another problem I have with the flash is the battery cover. It's flimsy and I find it awkward to open and close at times. I always feel like I'm gonna snap it off by accident.
Overall I am happy. It's a good flash for the price you pay. The battery life is good. I still haven't even had to recharge the batteries and I've almost taken 200 shots with it. My low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash. Anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash. The difference is night and day
