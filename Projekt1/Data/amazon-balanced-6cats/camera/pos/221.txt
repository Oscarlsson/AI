The camera handles very well - it's light and drives my Zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully. I get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight, which it does not have. The view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful, showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen, which immediately gives me the idea of the photo I want to use in my books. I say this is an outstanding lens and camera.
