Had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a D60, and now with a 1D MKII, but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350, which is my work horse. Due to the push and pull feature however, the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' Montana land, so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while, and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations.  The 70-200 F/2.8 is amazing. The twist zoom is a little close to the camera, so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it, and IMHO, is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (Rodeo, NASCAR etc) The clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. I did a comparison of images from my 70-200 F/4 when it was new, and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. I put an expensive filter on it, as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions, and I do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter, even though it is a good B&W..... so when I can, I shoot the lens with no filter if I require extreme detail. The 35-350L is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance, this lens would be my one and only. Oh, and I love the IS. As it is my first IS Lens, I treasure is, but know I will not buy another distance lens without it
