I needed this tripod to use with my 20X50 binoculars since the least movement with 20X magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field.

This tripod works well for that use.  It is sturdy, has lots of features and is reasonably priced.

However, if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars, a right angle adapter will be needed.  I found one on eBay for a few dollars.
