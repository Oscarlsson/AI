I received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule. I've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater Boston area. 

You can't get a better tripod for the money. In fact, you can't get anything "decent" for under $40-50 and even then I'm not sure you will get something this good. 

I had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office (which I didn't know) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when I told them I only paid $25 for it. 

Conclusion: is the tripod perfect, NO. The head looks a little like plastic. But it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website. This tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer.
