This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that
