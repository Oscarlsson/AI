I am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera. Occaisionally when I turn it on the lense doiesn't slide out, which is a little disconcerting. However, if I tap it, or turn it off and turn it o n again, it comes out to the operational position. I enjoy using it, amd wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one
