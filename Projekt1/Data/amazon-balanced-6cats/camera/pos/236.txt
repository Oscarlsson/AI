If you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors, you may have found what you're looking for.  The 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp).

The main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy.  I don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much, but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight.  And it's not exactly the sort of lens that I would want to toss into my backpack, just due to the immense size.

If you don't mind spending an extra $500, consider also the 70-200/2.8 IS (image stabilization) version of this lens.  It weighs even more, but the built in IS unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens
