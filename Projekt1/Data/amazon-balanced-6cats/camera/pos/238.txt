In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.  

What I like about it most:
- It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.  
- Very good battery life.
- Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses.

My gripes:
- The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week.
- Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses.
- Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.  
- Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...)

What would improve this camera the most:
- ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ 
- Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly.
- Replacing the "idiot modes" (i.e. "portrait", "landscape", etc.) with modes that you could customize
