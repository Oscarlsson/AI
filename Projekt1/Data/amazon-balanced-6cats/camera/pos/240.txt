I started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability. Having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap, this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least, is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself, allowing full ease of rotation of the camera.  Though I have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of AA batteries, having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and I am in the heat of shooting. I always travel with my charge AND four AA batteries. I would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the EOS-20D and EOS 30-D. One thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases.
