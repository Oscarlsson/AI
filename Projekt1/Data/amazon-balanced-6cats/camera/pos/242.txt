Over the years I have been using Quantum Turbo and later 2x2 units ( No Turbo SC yet) to power various Canon speed-lights from 540EZ to EX580. With some skepticism I picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment. Well, although Quantum units  still have a place in my kit to power Metz Unit, I love the convenience of CP-E3. One recommendation. Buy couple of extra battery inserts, if you do lot of fast shootings, and keep them loaded with good quality Duracell NIMH's
