This is a great lens. I do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. It is not so heavy so I use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in B & H). This is the best value I have ever got for a lens. Now I can't wait to get 17-40mm f4L too. You can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6, of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject. 
People complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective. I like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag. I think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful
