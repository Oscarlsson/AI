I have taught photography at the college level, shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion, and am very demanding about image quality.   I am quite satisfied with the image quality from my Kodak P880, particularly after I installed the newest firmware upgrade available from Kodak.

I went through several 7MP to 8 MP cameras before finally getting the Kodak P880.  The P880 has better image quality than some high end Sonys and Olympus 7-8 MP cameras like the DSC-V3 or the SP350.  I tested the P880 against the even higher end 10.3 MP large sensor Sony R1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the P880 and the R1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction, which the P880 images accept particularly well.   The zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range.   Balance, manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs.   The camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in RAW format and exposure bracketing modes but that really doesn't bother me because I do mostly landscape and fine art photos.   RAW file format is directly supported by most versions of Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements as well as most other RAW processing programs like Bibble Pro.  Unlike most sub-$500 cameras, the P880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters, a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe.   Manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well.   The direct mechanical zoom is also nice.

Overall, the P880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot SLR-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film SLR.   

Although not small enough to slip in a pocket, the size is still reasonable and light
