This is my first and very expensive entry into digit SLR photography.
I have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously.

I was avoiding DSLR's because I used to rarely use my EOS film SLR.
The convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming.
Unfortunately so are it's limitations.

So back I came, and the only choice though expensive was the EOS 5d for it's full frame sensor! The pain was reduced by the double rebates.

Wow! This is a revelation! Beautifull images, lot of control.

I did notice that the AF was not as fast as my old Elan IIE.

I was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing. I am not happy with canon for this, but I really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned.

This camera also needs prime or L lenses, because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses. This add's to the cost.

This is an exceptional photographic tool that I hope to use to improve my skill as I explore all it's capabilities
