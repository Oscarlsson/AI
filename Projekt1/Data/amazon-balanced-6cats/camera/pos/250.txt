There's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod. But for $16 the Sima SMP-1 is a tremendous value. 

I have a Sony DSC-W5 digital camera and have done everything I can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos. This monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry. 

The key is that it is small enough and light enough that I can take it almost wherever I go. And because it's so small, I can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod. 

A monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod. But this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that I take on trips
