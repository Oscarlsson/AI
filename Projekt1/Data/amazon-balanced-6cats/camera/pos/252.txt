I purchased this case for my Canon A530 camera. I find that it does a great job of being light,durable,and compact. It keeps the camera clean and scratch free. However I wish the case had a better carrying capacity. I would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips. I use different ones for different pictures or video. Batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy.
 The case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn. That can be a bit akward. Otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well.
