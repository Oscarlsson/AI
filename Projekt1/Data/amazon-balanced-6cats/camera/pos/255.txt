I purchased this lens for my Canon EOS 20D digital camera and so far I really like it.  It focuses fast and produces very sharp, clear images.  As with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake; I've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots.  I really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots.  The lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed, which is typical for Canon products.  For the price range, this is an excellent lens.  You can only do better by spending considerable more money on an IS lens
