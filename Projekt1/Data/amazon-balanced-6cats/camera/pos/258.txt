I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?
