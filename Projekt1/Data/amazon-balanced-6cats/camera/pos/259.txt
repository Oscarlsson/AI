The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.
