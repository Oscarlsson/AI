It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.  Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags.  I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack
