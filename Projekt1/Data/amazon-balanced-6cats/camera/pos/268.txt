This thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not-so-fattening way.  I hvae an external flash, macro kit, 28-80 lens, 50mm lens, 18-55mm lens, DSLR w/batt grip and 75-300mm lens ATTACHED all fit into the main body of this thing.  Everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking, hiking, biking, etc.  The addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you'd want, but the bag all by itself is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough - get away from huge bulky shoulder bags!!  Lowepro did it again
