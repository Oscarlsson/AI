After using both lenses I think this is much better. Here are my reasons:

1- f 2.8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate.
2- Bokeh is much better in this one.
3- Macro is slightly better on this one.
4- 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size.
5- IS is not very crucial in 24-50 range.
