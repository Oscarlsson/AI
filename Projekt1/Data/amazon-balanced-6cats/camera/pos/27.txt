Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already. 

Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked.

This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment
