15 years of photography experience here... The Sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites (go ahead and search) and this is a very good product. The canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing, but with the massive depth of field with this lens, it's not a problem at all. 

Be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital SLR that has APS sensors like my 20D or digital rebel, then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital SLRs. 

Watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also...but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses. 

This is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more. If you search around, you can find much lower prices on this lens
