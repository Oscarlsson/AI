I am not much of a photographer. I found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great. Believe me, it's the camera.  The stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time. I can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily.  I'm thrilled. You do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb. memory card when you buy the camera.
