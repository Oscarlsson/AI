I bought this filter for my 28-135 IS canon lens and so far it has worked out great.  Unlike some of the other tiffen filters I bought, this one fits just right on the lens.  All sides are even and it sits flush against the lens.  I haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures I've taken yet, but I haven't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens.  The night shots I've take so far, I've been quite pleased with, however
