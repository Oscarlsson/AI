i have another camera w/ 12x optical & tons of features but i wanted something compact & ready to take quick snaps. this fits the bill. on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots. the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera (canon A80)...either that or my hand is steadier. last but not least - the battery life was impeccable. I took a nearly 200 photos, plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge. the battery is a 'custom' one which concerned me but the charger is VERY compact and travels well. it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables :)
