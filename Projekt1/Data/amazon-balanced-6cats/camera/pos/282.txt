Yes it is a very fine lens. IS and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this I decided to sell it in favour of my EF 24-70 2.8L after 2 weeks of usage.

f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier. Bokeh is also worse than the other one. 
the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies. 
105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. 
Plus the macro option is weaker on this one.

If you don't care about the weight go with the EF 24-70 2.8L imho.
