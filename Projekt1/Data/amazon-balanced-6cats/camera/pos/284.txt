I've had this lens for 2 months now, and love it. It was my first "L" lens and I can see the quality difference in this line. First, I tried the 28-135 IS-pretty good. But I wasn't totally happy, so returned it and ordered the 24-105 L. Now I'm happy. Contrast, sharpness, & CA are much better. Build quality & feel are superior as well. Plus the IS really works. I will try & get all IS lens in the future, I believe it is worth the extra cost. Focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth & steady. If you're on a budget, the 28-135 is real nice. But to go all the way, I recommend this lens. The IS on the 24-105 L is quieter I found. The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens.
