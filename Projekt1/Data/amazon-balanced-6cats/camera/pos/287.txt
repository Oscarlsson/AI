For the price and quality I rated this lenses with 5 stars.
If you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos I took in Europe.  I too around 5000 photos. I posted a few on the web (See link below).

For the price I recommend this lens as walk around lens. The zoom is pretty usefull They are very realiable and (almost) very sharp. Get this lens instead of the kit lens (18-55 mm) until you are ready to spend more.

Here are some of my pictures taken in Europe with this lens (Images have been compressed):
