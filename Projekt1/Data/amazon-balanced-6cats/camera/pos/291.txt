This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.

The white box is for general use.  Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.

PROS:
Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.
A quality product that works.

CONS:
Non
