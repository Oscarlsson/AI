This replacement battery is half the cost of Canon's yet offers longer life.  I bought it when I first got my SD10.  When one battery runs out, the spare goes in.  The Lenmar still works great while the Canon is near end life!  I am buying two more since they are so cheap!

DO NOT buy no name batteries on ebay.  They do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money!  Don't do it..
