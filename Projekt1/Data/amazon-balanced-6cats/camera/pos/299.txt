I recently moved into the prosumer level of digital.  The Canon D30 has proven to be an awesome camera.  There maybe better (D60), but if you are serious about digital, the D30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price.  There is a slight lag between shots, but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains, the time between shots is hardly a distraction
