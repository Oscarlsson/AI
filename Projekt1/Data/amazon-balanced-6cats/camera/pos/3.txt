This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched
