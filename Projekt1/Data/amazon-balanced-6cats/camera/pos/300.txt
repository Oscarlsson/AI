I took this with me recently to Australia and shot landscapes as well as others, and the pictures came out better than the film cameras I have used recently, plus you don't need a scanner.  This camera works great, a must have for semi-pros.  Pros, wait for the new 1D.  Pictures come out great at 11&quot;x17&quot;
