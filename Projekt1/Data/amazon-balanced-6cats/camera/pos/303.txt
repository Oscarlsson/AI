First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color "USM" at the front of the lens.  

According to the reviews, compare with the non USM ones, optically they are the same. However, the USM motor does focus faster and much quieter. 

People complain about the build quality. Actually I feel that it is really not that bad, much better than the Canon 50mm f1.8 II. The USM auto focus performance is fast, never hunt, and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 II. It fits nicely on the XT.

Do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. We have to compare apple to apple. If you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely, the images will come out nicely. 

1. This is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. If you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed, go get a different lens. (For example, I use a Canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.)

2. The distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. Avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. However, this can be easily corrected on computers.

3. Step down the aperture to F8 or F11, the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners. 

Overall, the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. It is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. This fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens.
