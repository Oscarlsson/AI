Let's be honest...  a "kit lens" that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be Canon L-series quality.  Sure, you can find a better quality lens, but not for $70 you can't!

I plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots.  Personally (and this is a personal preference), I find that I tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the Rebel XT, I'm in great shape with some of my other lenses.

If you don't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal, and you are getting a digital EOS with the 1.6x magnification factor, then buy this lens.

Please don't let some of the other "lens snobs" sway you - a few of which are actually "posers" that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value.  I can hear them now.. "it isn't contrasty enough", "the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end", "pin cushion is significant"...

I say BAH!!

Are these statements true... sure they are... to a degree.  But let's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky.

Buy the lens, load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and GET OUT THERE!!  

If you find yourself shooting at the wide end often, THEN sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another (higher quality) lens... very little lost.  

Enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures...  good luck
