I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc. 

My only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations.  Pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond, sometimes not responding at all.  Also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular AA batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if I was shooting in cold weather.  I would definately recommend rechargable batteries.

Overall I've really enjoyed this camera.  I've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which I was rarely in anyway) it never let me down.  Both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it
