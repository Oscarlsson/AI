I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. In addition to the light output, the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced, an excellent feature. Getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because I am totally "brochure reading averse." 

Twenty years ago I was a photographer with big equipment, but had given up both.  I was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit
