Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, "Mr Magoo" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good. 

I am using a borrowed version right now, but as soon as I pay off my new 24-105 f/4 L IS USM lens (very, very awesome), I will buy my own  70-200 f/2.8 IS USM. It's as good as it gets in this lens range, but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera, carry on, as it's all about the end user.

For everyone else, this lens is the Holy Grail of mid range telephoto lenses. It is simply the best available in it's range, and responds well to Canon tele adapters. If you can figure out a way to afford this lens, buy it, as it is all that. If you are a Nikon lover buy this lens anyway, and buy a fairly cheap 20D body to make it work. It's OK to tell your friends that you used a Nikon to take the pics, but you will end up knowing that Canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century.

(Sorry, Nikon fans, but this lens stands all by it's self in the grand scheme of things. It's simply awesome.)
