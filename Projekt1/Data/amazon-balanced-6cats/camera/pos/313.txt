This camera is really great.  I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a "loaner" while my 20d was in repair.

Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d.

The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands.  The features are great too.  And the image quality is awesome.  I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job.  Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars.

The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering.  The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d.
