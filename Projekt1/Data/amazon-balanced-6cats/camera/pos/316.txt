I have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it.  It is as fantastic as others note herein.  The 2.8 through the focus range is really great.  Superb.  The VR function is really a neat trick.  It is super fun to play with.

The drawbacks are size and weight.  After a 1/2 hour of shooting, your arms will get tired.  Remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera.  This lens is definately heavy enough to bend/warp the camera body
