Up Front: If you're considering this lens, stop considering  - and buy it. I had occasion to try the Tamaron Zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the Tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. None of that is a problem with this Canon beauty. I am using it as my normal lens. The contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. It's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a TV camera. It's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical Abs....

Tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges. And there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges. Photoshop nails the latter dead'er than Britney Spears' career. I've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups, with most captures cropped, yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13X20. At that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject's pores, but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters.
