I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly
