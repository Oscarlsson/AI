Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures. 

The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard.

The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups
