For the money, you absolutely can't beat this lens.  It's very fast and sharp.  Not fast to focus, but what do you expect at $70?  I have four lenses , some costing 4x's as much as this one...yet I use this one the most.  Anyone looking to step up from the kit lens, or anyone looking to buy a camera body w/out the kits lens should look to buy this lens
