I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it.  For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose.  My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media.  I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't.  On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body.  The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera.  Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely
