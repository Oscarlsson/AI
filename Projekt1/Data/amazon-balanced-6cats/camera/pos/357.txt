I use my Canon 10d mainly for Astrophotography. Most of the time, 
it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of 
time, anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes. This ACK-E2
adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a 
drained one, while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my 
house. Continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash
storage. The package included several AC power connectors which is 
very useful while travelling. Amazon provides a wide range of items 
to choose from.
