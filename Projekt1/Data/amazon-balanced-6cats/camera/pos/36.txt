This is a great lens for star fields. It is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest. The focus was sharp to the corners without coma. See my photo of a portion the Milky Way. This was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a Rebel XT on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table
