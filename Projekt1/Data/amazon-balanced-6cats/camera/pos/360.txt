This is a fabulous and reliable camera. Feels solid. Fantastic pictures. Easy to operate. A new D40 has been announced over the past few days, but its lack of an LCD display and buttons to manage basic camera controls (to reduce weight and make it more user friendly) would still make this my recommended Nikon DSLR. Expect prices to fall as the D40 becomes available
