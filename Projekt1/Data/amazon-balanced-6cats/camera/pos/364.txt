Aside form the fact that Canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic, the remote switch does work well.  It does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the Canon cameras.  People with big hands may have a little trouble using this product.  Overall, a "must have" addition for anyone interested in long exposures, images with excellent sharpness and depth of field
