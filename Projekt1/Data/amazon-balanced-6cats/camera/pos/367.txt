Had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it, have'nt regretted it one bit. This lens is clear with excellent color, saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing. Coupled with an external flash it's great indoors as well. Have been using it as my everyday walk around lens. Zoom range is excellent(Rebel XT/XTi 1.6 magnification). Though it's somewhat on the big side, it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck. Purchased the hood seperately which, for the money should have came with the lens. 
Anyway, this lens offers excellent value for the money and you won't regret the investment
