This is the first IS lens that I've owned. I had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that I took the step up. 

Keep in mind that tis is an EF not EF-S lens. This makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my Digital Rebel.

I love the zoom range (great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots.

Just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under "Share your own customer images".
