From all the reviews I read, I expected certain pros and cons from this lens.  I was not disappointed.
pros:  very sharp lens with very good colors
cons:  vignetting at wide open, and a little too contrasty
For myself, the pros outweighed the cons for the price.  It is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras, where it becomes a 38mm lens
