This kit is a must have for any of the compatible Canon cameras. Digital camera rule #1: ALWAYS carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for  that alone. The leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. The neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it. It comes in handy when I need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags
