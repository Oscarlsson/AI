I've had my D2H for 9 months now. I've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great. It seems this issue plagued a minority of users.

Camera is very fast, exposes well and delivers results. It's primarily designed to be a sports and Photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. It's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels, but they are 4 GREAT megapixels. Images upsize wonderfully. 

I love my unit, and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup, or wait for the D2X. The price of the D2x is making that decision a bit easier and I'm leaning toward another D2H.
