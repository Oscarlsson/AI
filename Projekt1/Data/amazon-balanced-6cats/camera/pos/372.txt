I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed
