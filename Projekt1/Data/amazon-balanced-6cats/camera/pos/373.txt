I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall
