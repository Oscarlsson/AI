The Philips Digital Frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that I've gotten.  The resolution and picture quality superb, and the sleek outer design is an additional plus.  Also, the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord, which is very convenient. 

As another reviewer said, you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want.  It would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a BlackBerry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to.  

Also, I would like to see Philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well, that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the USB flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card. 

Thank you
