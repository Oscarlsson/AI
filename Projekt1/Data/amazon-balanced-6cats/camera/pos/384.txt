I am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera.  I've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots.  The winding mechanism is easy to use.  Finally I have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember.

It's even suited for kids over ten to use.  Mine had lots of fun with their own Quick Snap
