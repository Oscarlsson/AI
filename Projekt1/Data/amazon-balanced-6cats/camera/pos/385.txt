  This camera is perfect for me I have a [...] an a [...] an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film. This camcorder is small enough that some days I have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go. Also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed. 
  The settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use.
  It takes really good video's an pictures although Ive not taken alot of still pictures because I like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip. This camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc. Ive got a few 2 gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go. 
  The battery does not last a long time so I recommend a couple extra, there pretty cheep here on Amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your PC for any lengh of time. 
  I dont know anything about camera's an how they work I just like to take the pictures an so far this has been the easiest camera /camcorder ive seen
