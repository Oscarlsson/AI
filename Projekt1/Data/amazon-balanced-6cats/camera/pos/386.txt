I received the XACTi a few weeks ago and it's performing like I hoped it would.  The controls are a very simple and intuitive.  All the required hardware is included.  Does not require any additional software to run on Mac or Windows.

I have a MacBook with Boot Camp running Windows XP Pro.  The camera works easily with either platform.  It is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive.  I am using a SanDisk 2gb SD memory card.

Another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with miniDV.  The quality may not be the same as miniDV but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference.  The quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size.

My old camera was a 2 mega pixel Canon Powershot A60.  This is rated at 6 mega pixel.  You can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies.  When filming movies, the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth, even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers.

This is my first camcorder so I can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away
