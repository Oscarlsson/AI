I going to write the for non techs out there...

I can use it, my wife can use it, my mom can use it and my 5 year old son can use it. It is just that simple to use. You do not need to know anything about taking shots, other than how to zoom and pick the right settings, and if you play with the camera for a few days you will know them.
One other reviewer said to get the following:
1. At least a 512 MB Memory Stick Pro Duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go
2. Rechargeable AA batteries and a charger
3. Case

and i must say YES, YES and YES... to all, they are a must...

This camera, feels good in your hands, screen size is great. You can see the screen in both sunlight and at nights.
The menu is very easy to follow and the quality of the picture are clean and clear.
i can't comment on the software that comes with the camera as i have a Apple computer and i use iPhoto.
For the price, i felt like i got a $[...] Sony...
