I'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as I once was and I eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere I went.  I got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more.  Digital SLR's are pricey and as a friend pointed out I'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her.  She recommended this model and the more I looked at it the more I liked it. 
It is a fixed lens model, but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need.  It start up fast, zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to.  It has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want.  It does macro.  And it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised.  
So far I haven't come across anything that it can't do.  This is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want to go full digital SLR yet.
