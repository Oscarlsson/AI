Unlike many reviewers I am not diver.  I bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera wouldn't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park, pool, and beach.  This equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash.

This case has out lived an S400 and S500.

Well worth the $170 price tag
