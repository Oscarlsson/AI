Being in Hawaii, I spend plenty of time in the water...so having an underwater housing for my camera is almost a necessity.  I have been very happy with the results, shooting in the water (snorkeling, etc) and above the water (surf footage-just watch out for water spots on the lens).  Some of my photos are up for view in other parts of the page for this housing.

I treat things pretty roughly, and have been using this for about a year with no problems.  And I am in the water with it on an almost daily basis.  I like being able to use all the features of the camera (minus downloading images or changing the battery or CF card) while the camera is in the housing-something you cannot always say when looking at aftermarket housings that are non-Canon manufactured.  Everything mates up cleanly and works great, I am very happy with my purchase.

Just remember to rinse it off/soak it in freshwater after taking it in the ocean or the pool to keep the corrosion at bay, and put a little light silicone grease on the o-ring for trouble free use
