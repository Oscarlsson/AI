I just bought this waterproof case in order to use my Canon s410 on a scuba diving trip.  I was a little nervous at first (I could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone!), but I have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably!  I used it on 6 dives, and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet.  I did not have one leak!  A word of caution--I followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel (just a small amount).  I would like to think that the camera would not leak without this, but I did not want to take any chances.

I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their Canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach
