Bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera.  Am pleased with the trade up that I made.

The shape is similar to my old film camera.  Thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it.  It has made the transition relatively smooth.  I'm sure there are smaller cameras out there, but this one is small enough.  The display is also a good size - bigger than most that I looked at.

I am not a genius at computers, so I was concerned that I would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the PC.  But, all I need to do is plug in the cord and click a button.  Very easy to follow any instructions.

I did notice that the display "freezes" for a second or two after a picture is taken.  This is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots.  I did run into some lag time during an Easter egg hunt this past weekend, but still managed to get about a dozen good shots.

Overall, I like the camera and only wish I had gotten up the courage to go digital sooner
