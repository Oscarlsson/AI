I bought my Canon A540 recently from Amazon and am completely satisfied. I added a 1Gb SD card for $11 from Ebay and a charger with 4 2500NiMH AA batteries from the supermarket.  The images are clear and large. You have the options of full automatic, various manual settings up to full manual and a wide selection of preprogrammed modes.  

At work we needed a new camera to record tiny scratches and imperfections in our manufactured product, so I took my camera in to demo. Using the standard lens (a macro lens is available but I don't have it yet) we photographed a quarter using only ambient light. In less than a minute we had the image on the screen and were able to blow it up until the date filled the screen and still maintain good detail.  As a result we are now buying one for work with a macro accessory lens.

I totally recommend it as an excellent all rounder
