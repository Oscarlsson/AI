When I purchased this camera I was really conflicted on wheather I should get a digital still camera or a digital video camera.  So when I decided still and found out the Canon PowerShot had a video feature, I was pleased but had very low expectations.  BOY WAS I SUPRISED!  This camera has so many fun features for both still and video pics.  And the quality is awesome for both!  There is a video email option so you don't have to guess if your videos are going to fit into an email.  But if you want you can create some really good quality video with a quick adjustment.  And all of it transfers easily to my computer.

Plus with still pics there are lots of easy features to choose from so you can quickly set up for any kind of shooting sinario.
