I purchased this camera for shooting product photos for our website. I had been using a Nikon Coolpix at 5mp and wanted something relatively low cost with higher mp for the next few years. We plan to purchase something totally outlandish in a few years for super-quality printed photos, but for now, this camera is an excellent investment. Easy and small enough for everyone in the company to carry on trips abroad, but inexpensive enough to not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten by a hyena.

I've read some reviews that talk about blurred photos...I'm really surprised. I began using ours after I had my son, so many photos were taken without a tripod, one hand holding a nursing child and the other shooting photos...and none of the images turned out blurry. I have taken a few photos of my son now that he's a six-month-old super action hero that look like cotton candy on my Nikon but turn out crystal clear on the Sony. 

The movie mode is a real plus. I'm actually on this page today because I'm looking to buy one of these for my personal use with video recording in mind. We have a digital video camera, but with plenty of 1G memory cards in hand, I'd rather record action with this camera--the quality and sound are worlds better.

This is a lovely little low-cost camera that's suitable for a wide range of users.  I love it
