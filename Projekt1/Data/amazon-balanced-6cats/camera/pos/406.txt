We canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks.  I wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it.  

The Sports Pack is completely water proof (up to 7m).  I've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry.  

The case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality. It is relatively simple to operate and assemble. You have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case, so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used.

My only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area.  So far I haven't had any problems but I've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs.

All told, I'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water I would recommend this case
