It is rated for 5 meters but I took it to 9 and there were no sings of moisture or a single drop. The antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour. The microphone records sound well. I have a High Def cam and the S.Pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water. In the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive, and by experience I recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down - even more snorkeling. There are special weights that are mounted to the enclosure using the trypod whole. I would say a 14-18 onz it fine.
It is a great item
