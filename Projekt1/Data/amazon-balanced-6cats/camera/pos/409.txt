For its size and price, this little light can't be beat. Very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors. I think this is a must have for camcorder owners. My VHS family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy, so I see this as a miniscule investment for the long-term return.
