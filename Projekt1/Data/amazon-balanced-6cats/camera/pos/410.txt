In short, I love it. 
The XH A1 is a professional looking camera and has all the features you need.
It is a bit complex for those who are not true prosumers or pros, and the manual is not consumer oriented.

The picture qualitity is, so far, the best I've seen in non-pro cameras. The 3 CCDs at 1/3 inch each are truely spectacular. 


The 2 external XLR connections are the reason I looked at this camera. If you want to mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic, this is the camer to do that. Just make sure you read over the XLR connection settings in the manual a few times and change the buttons (unfortunately located in 4 different locations on the camera) to the right settings. A set of good headphones is a must-have when not using the wonderful built-in mic. By the way, this built-in mic eliminated one of the situations where I always needed a mic, a close up interview situation--the built-in is very sensitive and accurate for this type of thing.

The downside to this camera is really only that it does NOT contain an HDMI adapter. Sadly CANON did not provide one; instead they opted for a custom (HDMI-looking) adpater that if you loose the cable you can't run down to Fry's or Radio Shack to get another one. :(

The other thing is that it is 1440x1080 instead of 1920x1080.  Their new CANON HV20 ( a 1CCD camera due in April 2007) is 1920x1080 resolution--just seems odd to me.  But then I'm the guy that will get a 10 Megapixel camera simply because its better resolution. :)

The bottom line, don't get the Sony FX7, get this one. The Sony seems and is easier to use, but it doesn't have an external XLR jack, it uses 1/4 inch CCDs, and in a side-by-side test doesn't offer as good performance in low light situations as this one.

The camera is a bit complicated, but if you're willing to learn, it is a wonderful tool.
If you need true point and shoot, I'd wait and get the CANON HV20
