I bought this for my new HDV FX1 Camcorder, and it works great.  Unlike the Century wide-angle lens, this is fully zoom-through.  Lens is .8x, which is less than the Century and others, but just about right for HD--since the FX1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out, this just gives it an extra boost, converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm.  Also, very little barrel distortion.

In all a great lens.  Only drawback is that it's a big (heavy) lens, but then, hey, it's for a serious prosumer camcorder
