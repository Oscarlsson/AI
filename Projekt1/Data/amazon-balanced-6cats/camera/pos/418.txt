I recently purchased this camera.  It arrived one day before I was due to fly out to Palm Springs.  I took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures.  This may or may not be because I am a novice photographer. Even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry, but all others came out better than I ever expected.  I think once I play around with it, my night time pictures will improve, but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me.  No regrets with this purchase though.  Also, buy a larger memory stick.  The one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and I had to run out and buy another.
