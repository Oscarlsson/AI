I purchased this camera so I could photograph wildlife on hikes.  I needed something that was not too heavy, was image-stabilized, with telephoto power.  This camera meets all those requirements.  It does have one problem, however.  In bright light, the viewfinder blanks out, so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed.  I have solved that problem to some extent, by pointing the camera at the object, and letting the autofocus do the rest.  This "fix" has resulted in many excellent photos.  Like many other small cameras, the results tend to be contrasty, and I modify this tendency in photoshop
