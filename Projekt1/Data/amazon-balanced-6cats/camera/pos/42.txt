This is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies.  The bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense.  Also, the bag can hold a lot of accessories.  I had to Canon Rebel XT bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment.  The flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder, but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge!  The top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map.  The all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it.  The bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag.  Basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything.  Yes, I have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable
