I love my new Canon A710.  Large LCD makes taking pictures easy to frame, color and sharpness is good all around and needing only 2 AA batteries is great.  I no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries, I can go into any drug store.

Only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card 16mb.  For a few bucks more put in at least a 1Gig.

Overall rating for a camera in this price range - above average
