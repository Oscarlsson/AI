Overall, I am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the Canon A 710 IS.  This camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old HP 935 -- the old guy still worked fine, but was very slow and didn't handle low-light situations very well at all.  I was also looking for a bigger zoom range.  After weighing the options, I decided that the A 710 IS was the way to go.  

Pros:
- Uses standard AA batteries.  Invaluable when you're on the go and need more juice.  Also, the battery life has been very good - I'm using the same AA rechargables I used for over a year in my old camera, and I routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge. 

- Huge LCD screen that doesn't suck power.  Fast response, too.

- Digital zoom that actually helps!  Because the camera is 7.1 MP and has an image stabilizer, I can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom.  Very impressed.

- Very wide range of available settings.  You can customize almost any aspect of this camera, from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to....

- Big enough, and small enough.  It will fit in my back pocket most of the time, but it's big enough to remind me that it's there before I sit down.  

- Fast processing time.  Taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old HP took forever!  The fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly, and also jump to an image very quickly too.  Much better than previous Canon models even.

- Memory backup battery.  Remembers what day it is, time it is, and what image you're on -- even if you take the regular AA's out.  Very useful.

- Fast start-up time.  It's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on, especially if you bypass the "welcome" image sound and screen.

- Cool features, like color swap and color select.  Also, there's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera.  The camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video, a nice touch.

- You can change lenses and add filters very easily.


Cons:
- As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I upgraded from the HP was to have better luck with low-light situations.  I've had the camera now for just over a month, and I still haven't figured out the best setting for clear, low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older Canon models, say, the A 510.  As mentioned, there is a wide range of settings available, which can also be a negative if you don't know quite what you're looking for.

- No "action" setting.  Similar to above, the one setting I miss the most from other Canons is that action setting.  This camera requires you to set it manually.

- Video file sizes.  A typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 MB -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online.  Also takes up a good chunk of a 1MB memory card, really quickly.  Canon would have done better to use MPEG-4 here instead of AVI.  

- Similarly, the video quality doesn't reflect the large file size in most cases, though the sound quality is very good.

- The big LCD is great, but is very hard to see outside in the sun.  It does have a backup optical viewfinder, but using that puts your nose up against that LCD and leaves a nice smudge on it if you're not careful.

- Buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use, but that's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time.  

- Bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- I have to go back through the old HP software if I want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600!  



Overall, as mentioned, the camera is a huge improvement from my old HP, and even with all of those little annoyances, I'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog.  It's no SLR, but it's getting there.  And, you certainly can't beat the price
