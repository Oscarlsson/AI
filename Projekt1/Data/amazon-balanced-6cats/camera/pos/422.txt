For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy.

The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures
