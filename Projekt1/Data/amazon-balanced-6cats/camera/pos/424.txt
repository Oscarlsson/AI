The ZR500 and other low-end Canon camcorders appear to be very fine products, well worth their price -- but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur-level home videos, have a look at the RCA Small Wonder.  

Simple, rugged, totally easy to learn and operate, no frills but still some very neat features, takes perfectly adequate videos of your children, your dog, whatever -- and about half the price.  Bought one; totally satisfied
