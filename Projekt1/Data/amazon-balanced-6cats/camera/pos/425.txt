This case was well thought out for snorkeling/diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera.  Definitely a better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one.  
The only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720SW camera - since size is one of its strongpoint
