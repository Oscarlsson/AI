I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. I have had if for more than one year, and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. The 1 minute video feature is great, and was an unexpected bonus (since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon). 

The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great. Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it. I figure at some point I'll have to change the battery, because Lithium-Ions lose 20% capacity per year, but so far it has worked flawlessly.
