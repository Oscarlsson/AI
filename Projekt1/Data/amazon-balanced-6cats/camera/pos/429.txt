This camera does everything it says; yes, it's waterproof and I was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time!!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars:  it is as slow as every other digital camera I've owned as far as focusing, multiple flashes, and then actually shooting.  You get your subject's attention and they smile, frozen, as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken (in low light.) I was especially intrigued by its "Bright Capture" technology, but it honestly doesn't seem any different in low light than my old Sony U20 2MP tiny little snapshot camera.  Still that same flash-in-the-dark look.  There is a fill-flash low light program mode (among many many others), but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob, even if you hold your breath and try to remain still.  My ideal snapshot camera is portable, durable, quick, easy, and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes.  This camera has 3.5 out of those 5.  It is way portable, very durable, easy, produces OK results but you have to mess with settings if you're not in daylight, and it's not very quick. 
Overall I am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere
