The case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. Then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. It makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. You can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack.

My digital Rebel XT fits with the Canon Battery grip and my macro lens attached, however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached. 

My Canon Speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag. The lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them. 

I bought a regular Lowepro camera bag, but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached. This bag is designed to have the camera with a lens. 

If you search Google images for the Lowepro Slingshot 200 you will see what I mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal.
