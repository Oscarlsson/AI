I can not find anything negative to say about this camera.  I wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as Casio's Exislim.  Even though this camera is not as small as the Casio, it is far superior of a camera.  Size why's, it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn't awkward or difficult to use.  The pictures from this camera turn out spectacular, the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera.  The lcd screen is also very clear, unlike the Casio and other camera's similar to this one.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  Highly recommended
