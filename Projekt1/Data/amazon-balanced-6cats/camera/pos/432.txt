I bought this for my mother-in-law who is in her 80s and set it up for her.  It's quite easy if you're already computer literate, and the controls are very user friendly as well.  The software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic, but for someone like my mother-in-law, it works well.

Wish I had a docking station for my Nikon.
