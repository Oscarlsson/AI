The Philips 8-Inch Digital Picture Frame is an excellent, high-quality device.  Very easy to get it going - the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device.  No need to mess around with memory cards - although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you.  Everyone who has seen ours loves it.  It looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent
