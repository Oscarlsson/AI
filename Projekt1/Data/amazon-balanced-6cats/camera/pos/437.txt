Looked at a number of cameras including the TZ3, P5000, and a few others.  Nothing compared to the G7 which is the one I ended up going with; IS, 6x lens, incredible quality, etc.

If you want the best camera out there and don't feel like messing with a DSLR, the Canon G7 is in a league of it's own ~ The Benchmark by which all other manufacturers strive towards.
