I bought this camera more than half a year ago. My intention was to get a decent camera for images, but then also be able to use it for filming short movies.

I'm very pleased with its performance. In good lighting conditions, colors come out to be amazing. I really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! In darker conditions, well, it still works fine, not nearly as bad as I expected from some other reviews. Photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore, but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people.

As about filming, it's terrific. I mean, resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so), better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. And the quality is super awesome, looks very neat on computer screen. Respect.

It has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming, but not many cameras out there can do that.

Oh, it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. A great buy
