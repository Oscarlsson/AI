Installing the software was a piece of cake, using it is quite another matter. The basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a PhD in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles, tweaks and options. First attempts? The moon came out real nice, but Saturn was a white blob with no fine detail. Nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the Celestron site. Will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well 
(oh - was using it on a classic LX200 in good see'ing conditions - sorry Celestron!
