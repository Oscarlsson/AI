I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, it's my 4th digital camera.  I am very happy with the photos I'm able to take, they are truly outstanding.  I'm still learning all of the settings but I'm finding everything to be user-friendly.  I like the way it feels in my hand and I'm pleased with the battery life.  I purchased a 2GB card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me.  The video is amazing, I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and  saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard, so I decided to tape it.  Not only was the quality good, the camera picked up the audio, which I never expected!  And I like that you can zoom in or out while you're taping, I wasn't able to do that with my last camera.

I've had no problems downloading the pics or videos to my computer and the prints I've gotten have been great as well
