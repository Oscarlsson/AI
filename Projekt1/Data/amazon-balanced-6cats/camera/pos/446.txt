We had a Canon Powershot S50 3 years ago, loved it. So this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera, we specifically looked for Canons. 

We originally were thinking of getting the SD700,800 or something like that. But after we compared these cameras together in a store near us. We found out SD900 has the finest LCD display, more opitions in control panel... So we came back and bought it from Amazon (our favorite online store). 

We used it in our last trip to Grand Cayon, LV, SF etc. This SD900 takes very good pictures, especially in good lighting conditions. Colors are also smooth and rich. 

The downside, as you may already read from others' reviews, no battery indication, no raw(it's ok, my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway, it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer), control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. Stich is a great function which comes with, but when in a very bright area, you can not see the stich alignment very well on the LCD screen (I guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on LCD dispay).

Overall, it's a wonderful camera, we love it. It's my husband's camera, I uses Canon 350D, but I borrow it from my husband sometimes because it's tiny compares to my 10 lbs "moose" and it takes very good pictures.
