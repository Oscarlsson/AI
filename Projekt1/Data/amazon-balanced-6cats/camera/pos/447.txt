At 10mp, this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures I have ever taken with a digital camera.  The clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera. The display, although pooh-poohed by others as too small, is quite large to me. 

The cameras small, lithe design is another selling point.  Nothing bulky about this camera. You can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to. 

Do yourself a favor and get this camera.  You won't regret it.
