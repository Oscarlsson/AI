I needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera, so I ordered this one and could not be happier with it.

It has all kinds of features, including some manual control options like white balance, etc. for those people who like to mess with that stuff (I'm more of an Auto person, myself).  I used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures, after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera.  The camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started, and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera.  The movie mode works good, too.  The colors come out bright and vivid.  The lag time between pictures is minimal, which is one of the main things I hated about my old 1.3mp Panasonic Palmcam, and the 7.1mp makes for some excellent detail in your pictures.  The only bad thing about the camera, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a movement stabilizer (or whatever it is called), so it can be prone to shaking, especially when you zoom using the digital zoom.  I like that the camera is small and lightweight, but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half.

Overall, I think this is a GREAT camera, and I don't think you can find a better camera for the price
