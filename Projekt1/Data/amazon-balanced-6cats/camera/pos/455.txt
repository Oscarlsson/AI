The Canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements, whether they are sand, rain, pool, or ocean.  For use on the beach, while snorkeling, or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing.  If you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands.  These weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing.  The kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing's buoyancy.  I prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by Canon.  I'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use.
