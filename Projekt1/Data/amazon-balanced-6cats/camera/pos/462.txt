I just got my new photo box today.  I was so excited I opened it at work.  Then I took a picture of my wendy's salad just to see how it looked.  The quality of the pictures are excellent(macro mode).  Light is evenly distributed.

Caution about the lights:
The lights get really hot really fast.  Untouchable within 2min. after I turn them on.  I suggest for the shear sanctity of safety, shut off the lights between object/scene changes.

The package arrived intact, the box was beat up a little, nothing major.  When I opened the item, I noticed the Camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom.  This could've been a bad/weak stitch, or may have happened during shipping, but nothing major was wrong, only that.  Besides, I can sew it!

Overall, this is a great product, and is easy to setup and carry around.  I'd definitely buy again
