I always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with.
This model helps you do both. You have a nice 5.1 MP still camera and MPEGMovie4TV video.
The very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge. I never had a video camera before because I hate to carry two camera and a big camera case, so this was the obvious solution.
I realize that instead of embracing the moment (for which they need the memory) most people often juggle between cameras.
Cons:
* Sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone
* Buttons are harder to find
* Software is not the best
* Wish had more zoom
Pros:
* Convince
* Compact
* Battery lasts long
* Flash is good
* Video sound quality is good
I wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing
