We bought this bag for our Panasonic PV-GS400 video camera, this bag is just the perfect size, we can fit our PV-GS400, tapes, extra batteries, recharger, video cables, remote control, and even a small tripod. Has different comparments. On top of functionality is done with a very high quality. I highly recommend it, just check your camera dimensions and compare with the bag before you buy
