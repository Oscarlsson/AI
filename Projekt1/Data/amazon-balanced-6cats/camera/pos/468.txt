This scope is one of the best Gen 1 units on the market. At 36 lines/mm, it has just about the best resolution. Most other units only have 24 lines/mm. The illuminator is bright (almost too bright), uniform, and has a crisp edge. It could be a bit larger, however, so that it would fill the field of view.

Note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens, (to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof.

Don't bother with the IR flashlight. It's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform.
