Yes, I am slow to make this review, maybe because I spend a great deal of time using this camera.
The ONLY thing I would like to have changed, is a rechargable pack.  At first I burned thru many batteries.  I switched to rechargables, and find that I still use a great deal of power, (I shoot often with the flash,) but now I can recharge the spent batteries after each session.  I use the charge of 12 AA's in a 3 hour shoot.
I use this camera for studio work and it has served me well for a good number of years already
