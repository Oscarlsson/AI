A little background first...

This was an upgrade camera for me, just over a year ago.  I was in 35mm format for over 20 years.  I used a Pentax K1000 body and several different lenses, tele-converters and filters.  At work, I've had 4 years experience with a Fuji Fine Pix 2MP "point-and-shoot".  It was provided by my work and was very durable (it had to be, as I am in Construction Engineering).  When I decided to switch "personally" to all digital I was very cautious.

I first looked for pic quality and durability.  From an "advanced-amature" photographer's point of view, this camera is great !!!

This camera never leaves my side.
It travels with me everywhere I go.
It is extremely durable as it is mounted to an "Ultra-Pod II" and I carry it over my shoulder (I don't keep it in a bag).
It provides me OUTSTANDING QUALITY POHOTGRAPHS (close, far or fast: work or play) at a very reasonable price.
It takes reasonable video (considering my 35mm took none at all).
It is easy to use and learn (even for an old 35mm guy).
It is lightweight and power usage is not an issue (NiMH is the way to go).

I take close to 20,000 pics a year for work and play.  I am always experimenting with this camera and it's limits.  I am so pleased with this camera (and the previous Fuji I used) that my next upgrade will be a Fuji as well (looking to 10MP).

For the $$$ you can't go wrong
