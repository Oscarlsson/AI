Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible.  If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition.  The AF only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies.  You do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body, but the extra reach is really nice
