The camera is great because it is small enough to slip into your pocket and take wherever.  I have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers.  We had a 10X optical, 5 MP kodak camera that worked well, it was just big and bulky, never to fit in a pocket.  The 10X optical zoom on the V610 also works well, the lenses never protrude from the camera when I use the optical zoom.  The viewing screen is large and very clear.  The menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great.  It would also make a fine camera for a beginner.  The panorama function works very well also.  I have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures. The camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick.  I have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom, picture quality, or functionality.  The LCD screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger, but don't let that stop you from getting the camera.  You will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative.  My only small frustration was when going skiing, I attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10X optical zoom and the image stabilizer.  It was at night and only the lights were on, the camera wouldn't focus on him until he was close, but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow. Otherwise the video has worked flawlessly.  There is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame. (Very useful)  My brother bought the Panasonic Lumix® DMC-TZ1K,(a very good camera also) before i got the V610 and now he wishes he got the V610
