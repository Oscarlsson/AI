I am totally satisfied with Product features. For me still it's  better than any available product from other company in this segment.
I ranked this product 4 because it manual dial malfunction very often. If I select Album mode it still thinks to be in SnapShot mode and vice-versa. It's out of guarantee and I'll hv to live with it.
Anyway there are many products present in market in this series to go with like W50 or something like that
