After owning and using the camera for a month or so now, I am delighted with it.  I have only replaced the batteries one time, so don't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for.  small lightweight, many features.  choice of 6 meg, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 meg photos at fingertips.  What I really decided on this camera for was the MACRO capability as I take photos of very small coins, and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that.  It preforms magnificantly.  My previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle.  I love the Samsung digimax S600.
