I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only "40% better".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.

You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.  

As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage
