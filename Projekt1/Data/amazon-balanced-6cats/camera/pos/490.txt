Okay, I am new to the world of stargazing.  I purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at Amazon.com.  I have been completely satisfied.  I am especially impressed with the clear, crisp viewing of the moon.  I can see a few planets, but they are of course very small through the eyepiece.

I do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope.  Take your time putting it together.  Read all the directions first.  Pay special attention to the details concerning the Collimator.  If you don't know what that is, you need to.  I almsot made some major mistakes, screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone.  

If you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions, you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself, especially on a clear night.

The package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more, but for the once-in-a-while gazer, this is the telescope.

See ya next review.
