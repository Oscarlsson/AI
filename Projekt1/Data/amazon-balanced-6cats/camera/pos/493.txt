I needed an extra battery.  This whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone.  In addition to the battery, you get a standard camera case (Retail $10-20) and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry 2 cameras, accessories, and the portable Canon printer.  There is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal
