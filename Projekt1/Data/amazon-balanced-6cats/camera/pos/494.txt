I bought one of these items in December '04 from Adorama.  It had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself.  I just ordered here and received a second one in March '07 and the "new" model has no instructions.  Other than that, it looks identical to the old one, so I assume the contents are the same.
Here are the exact words written on the old one:
"HYDROSORBENT 40 GRAM SILICA GEL"
"WHEN PINK, REACTIVATE 3 HOURS AT 300F"
The pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister.

I keep this product with my camera (in closed stuff sack) and it seems to work as advertised - though I guess you just have to have faith that it does - no easy way to prove it (except maybe in extremely humid climes)
