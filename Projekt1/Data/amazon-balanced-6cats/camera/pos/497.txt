To my knowlege, there simply isn't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator.  It's IR-sensitive mode (nightshot) is in B&W (rather than cheeseygreen), far superior quality-wise to anything Sony's got, and it's the only 3CCD that I know of with a low-light mode.  The image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade.  Time/Date stamps can be "burned in" so they xfer via firewire - again, the only camera I'm aware of with this feature.  The audio can be turned off which we know is a must.  And best yet, you can disable the sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on.  It's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand, but it's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame.  Finally, it's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing.  

The ONLY downside so far as I can tell is it's size - It's a big camera compared to the handicams I've had, and wouldn't be well suited for close-proximity work.  However, the black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly, and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit.

Highly recommended!
