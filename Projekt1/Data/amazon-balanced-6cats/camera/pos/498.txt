I'm by no means an expert, but I really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price.  I did a TON of research and landed on the AG-DVC30 after much agonizing over "to HD or not HD" as well as brands and features.  Based on all the reviews I read, this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money.  I have not been disappointed.  On my first outing, I took the cam to the Grand Canyon and Sedona.  Wow!  What incredible color and clarity!  I also really love the 16x zoom.  It's smooth and powerful.  I got great shots of the Colorado River from the rim of the Grand Canyon.  I'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great.  It is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject.  If you're interested in good audio, I'd suggest an optional mic.  If you just want great video, awesome color, and ease of use, this is your camera.  At the price (plus the rebate) you really can't beat it
