This digital photo frame has reasonably good picture quality and once set up, can be used by anyone in the selected mode.  I have it set for slide presentation mode and people enjoy looking at it.  I could easily see giving it, already set up, to people who are not computer savvy, such as grandparents.  To give them new pictures, send a new card and they slip that in.  That said, the cost is still fairly high and the buttons on the top of the frame useless unless you have them memorized or really good vision.  I would recommend this product
