We got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there isn't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film. We were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them. We were also aware of the battery problem, so she got rechargeable batteries. Awesome little camcorder, especially for the price
