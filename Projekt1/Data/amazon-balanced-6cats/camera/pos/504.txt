I RECENTLY RECIEVED MY NEW CAMERA, AND I AM THRILLED.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING WHICH CAMERA TO BUY SINCE DECEMBER (WHEN OUR LAST CAMERA WENT CAPOOT).  THERE HAVE BEEN MIXED REVIEWS FOR THE OLYMPUS SW SERIES, BUT COULD NOT RESIST THE APPEAL OF THIS CAMERA'S UNIQUE FEATURES.  I CANNOT WAIT TO TAKE IT INTO THE POOL THIS SUMMER WITH THE KIDS.  SO FAR, THE POINT AND SHOOT OPTIONS AND PICTURES HAVE BEEN LOVELY.  ANY PERSON CAN SCREW UP PICTURES WITH ANY CAMERA, BUT THIS CAMERA HAS SO MANY FEATURES TO AVOID THAT.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME TAKING EXTREME CLOSE UP SHOTS OF OUR GARDEN.  I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT QUALITY, AND HAD THAT MUCH SATISFACTION FROM A CAMERA SINCE WE FIRST SWITCHED OVER TO DIGITAL.  I AM VERY PLEASED, TO SAY THE LEAST, WITH THIS PURCHASE.
