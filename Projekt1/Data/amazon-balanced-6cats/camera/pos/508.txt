If you are expecting clear professional sound transmission, this is not it.  That's a wireless system costing $1,000 - $3,000.  This  system is strictly for home none professional use.  I think people were expecting this system to deliver the hi fidelity sound they hear on movies or TV soundtrack.  Professionals do not use this system.  That is the reason for the low price.  Home movies only.
