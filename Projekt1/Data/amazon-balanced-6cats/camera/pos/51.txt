This is a good tool, does the job well, and serves the purpose, but is a little overpriced and Canon keeps changing connectors, forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer.  

I give a 4 Star because of Canon, not because of the product.
If you are willing to pay for it, it's a good product.
