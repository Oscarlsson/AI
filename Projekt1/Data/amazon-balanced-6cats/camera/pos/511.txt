This product is so cool.  Whatever your situation is, if you have a lot of digital pictures, then I recommend going out and getting an SD card...preferably up to 1GB (or even 512MB), for use this with this product.  Even if your camera doesn't use SD, you can plop the SD card right into the picture frame and upload photos from your computer TO the card!  It's like a little computer, this frame.  Another big suggestion I have is to find a program online that resizes your photos to the dimensions of the frame (photo size explained in other reviews). (I downloaded Visualizer Photo Resize).  This will take photos down from its original size (e.g. 1.8 MB) to a smaller size (e.g. 500KB).  This will let your store dramatically more photos.  So far I have fit over 1700 photos in about 430MB worth of the 1GB SD card that I have!  The picture quality is very good and the frame can swivel to basically any angle and could be used horizontally or vertically.  Plus, it is a Philips, which is a great brand.  I have a Philips HD TV as well and it is my baby...I love it.  This is a great present for anyone!  How can you go wrong with a picture frame that replaces its picture any time you want
