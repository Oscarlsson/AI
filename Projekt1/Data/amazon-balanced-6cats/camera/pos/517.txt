This can be used in lieu of a replacement battery.  Plus if an electrical outlet is convienent, like when shooting inside, you never have to worry about running out of power.  Also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc/ac converter.  But not as overall convienent as an extra battery.  I thought it would also trickle recharge the battery, but it doesn't.  Nikon should add this feature in
