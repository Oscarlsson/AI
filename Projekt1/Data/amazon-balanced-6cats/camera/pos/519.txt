I had an Olympus Stylus 4MP and loved it but wanted a newer model.  I purchased this 710 and love it.  Olympus makes it so easy to take pictures with pre-set options and image stabilization.  I love the smaller size of this camera and it was easy to use.  There is no way to give it 4 1/2 stars so I gave it 5 but there is one thing I don't like about the area for the USB plug in. You have to pop off this cap (it hangs off the camera) and maneuver the small end of the cable in the camera (tight fit with the cap hanging there) then pop the cap back on..it just seems flimsy and I wonder if that cap will eventually break off.  In the 410 it was much easier to access this as it was near the memory card.  That is the only design feature I don't care for on the 710.  It is a great camera and I am very happy with the purchase.
