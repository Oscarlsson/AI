I already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my EFS 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing. Well, Canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the LP1116. This pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens. The cord is strong and silky and doesn't open accidently the way a silky cord would. Obviously we can't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand. The moment I buy another lens, I shall have to buy its matching pouch
