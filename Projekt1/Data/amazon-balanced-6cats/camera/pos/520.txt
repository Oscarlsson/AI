An excellent purchase that lives up to the Sony name. My main concern before buying it was that it would swivel enough that I could point my mini-camera straight down to take macro photos of documents. It does this easily, and the legs don't get in the way. It's small enough to chuck in my backpack and take it all the time in case I need it, and it has its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so that it doesn't get tangled up in anything else. Overall, I would rate it as excellent
