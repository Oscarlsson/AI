Picked mine up used on eBay for $180.  With the growth of the VR market everyone is dumping there old lenses.  You can get a used one for a great price.  This lens is great for the serious amatuer.

I have taken some incredible pictures with this lens.  The autofocus is a little slow and I have heard people complain about softness on the high end but I have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my D70 at 300mm.  Of course I shoot the photo on a tripod.... I have not experienced the softnes
