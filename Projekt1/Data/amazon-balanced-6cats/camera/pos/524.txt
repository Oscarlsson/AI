Go to Nikon's own website NikonUSA.com and compare the technical specifications of this version and the 'G' version of this lens.  There are only three differences.  One is that the 'G' version has its aperture set only by the camera body, while the 'D' version can have its aperture set either by the body or by a ring on the lens.  All recent Nikon bodies set the aperture.  The ring on the lens is invariably locked on all recent camera bodies.  The second difference is that one (1) of the 13 lens elements in the D version of the lens is made of Extra Low Dispersion (ED) glass.  If the dispersion difference is so important what is the deal with the other 12 elements?  Sounds like marketing to me.  The third difference is that the 'D' version costs three times as much as the 'G' version
