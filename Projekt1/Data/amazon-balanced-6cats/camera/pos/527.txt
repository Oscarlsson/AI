The binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power.
The 70mm lens were great at light gathering, and the 4.75 mm exit pupil
provide more light than most adults can use.  (The avg. is 3-4 mm)
With a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use.  You really need a tripod to use the full power effectively, but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly
