Bought these batteries & charger just before going on an overseas trip.  I didn't want to be bothered with frequently changing AA batteries, which seemed to last only a day or so of heavy use.  I was quite pleased with the performance of these rechargeables.  They lasted several days of heavy use before needing to be charged and they re-charged in only a few hours.  A big bonus that I didn't expect:  the recharger is compatible with European 240 voltage so I didn't have to use an electric converter!
