I bought this together with the Sony Alpha (very good deal from Amazon). The lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older KM 18-70. Images are very sharp and the lens is built very well. Great for wildlife imaging. The other reviewers are right; the AF isn't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera.
The end of the lens DOES ROTATE while zooming. It may not be good for some filters
