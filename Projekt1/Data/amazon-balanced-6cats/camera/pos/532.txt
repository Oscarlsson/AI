This is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size.  We bought it to replace our bulkier Sony DSC-F707.  The large screen is wonderful!  The video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video.  The battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left.  The main downside with this camera is the flash.  It doesn't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots.  If it weren't for the flash, I would have given this a rating of 5 stars.  This is overall a good camera.

For more serious digital photography, we prefer to use the Sony DSC-F707 as it has a better flash and zoom.  However, it is too bulky to carry around
