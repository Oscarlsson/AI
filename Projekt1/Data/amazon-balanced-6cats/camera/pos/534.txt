I've owned the T9 now for just about 3 weeks.  I purchased it after some extensive research.  Of course you never really know a product until you've had it awhile.  Here's my thumb nail opinion.
I like:
The ultra thin metal body
Optical image stabilizer
great photo quality
high ISO performance
large, high rez screen
Auto focus assist lamp works well
very fast start-up
fast recovery even after flash
lots of built in memory, but you need to buy the 1 or 2 gig card
ok slide show feature with music

I don't like:
Redeye doesn't work that well
Too few manual controls
needs white balance
needs long shutter speed modes
Chews up battery time pretty fast. Already ordered a second battery.
No optical viewfinder (most ultra smalls don't)
flimsy plastic cover over the battery will be first thing to break

All in all a great little camera.  Takes awesome, clear pics.  Not for the professional photographer, but that's not why you are considering it (I hope).
