Very compact, light and easy to hold - full marks for design. Buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to, but ok once mastered. Main downside for me it only takes DVD-R/RW- and not DVD-R/RW+, bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones! Also, can be a problem taking it abroad - I had issues charging it as it would take a standard US to UK converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal US plugs.
