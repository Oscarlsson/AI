This is the only tripod that I have ever owned, however, I do agree that it seems to be a very nice piece of equipment, especially for the very low price. It suits my needs well for a small digital camera. The only downside is that it does not come with a carry bag. This was an oversight on my part when I ordered, and I'm sure I would have to pay just as much as I did for the tripod to get a bag for it, so I will live with it as is
