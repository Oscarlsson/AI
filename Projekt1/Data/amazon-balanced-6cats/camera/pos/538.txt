  The Panasonic PV-GS500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of Panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the Spring.

  The PV-GS500 is compact, delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above, has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer. It lacks an audio output jack, which many will fault it for. It does have a separate microphone jack. The menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use.

  It is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact, uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that.

  Low-light performance is poor, but there is an accessory shoe, so you can mount an auxillary light. I would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings, parties and other group events.

  Battery life is about what you would expect, so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended.

  All in all, a very nice 3CCD camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package.
