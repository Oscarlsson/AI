Of course, it had to be Kodak. No matter what people say, i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera, I've found this camera to be a real warrior, last one I had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better, Photo cuality its very good and colors are great, no excesive blue or red in your pics, Night photo taking its excelent in close shots.

4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater, but its nothing a 25$ batterie charger can`t solve. 

Sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje
