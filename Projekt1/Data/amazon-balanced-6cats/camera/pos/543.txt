I bought this camera to replace a 3MP Kodak CX series when I thought I had lost it.  My 3MP took great pics and I never had any problems with it and I didn't want to have to learn to use a different brands software.

The Kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when I bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better.  The Kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files.

I haven't used the C533 a lot since I bought it but the pics I've taken have come out great. But just like the other reviews state, slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries.  However, if you spend the extra money for the Lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life.

All in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person
