Worked like a charm in my Panasonic AG-DV30 video camera!  Having 5+ hours of battery life really helps when you're on vacation and don't want to mess with charging batteries or being "selective" in your shooting.  This gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later.  Worth the money and a good deal here
