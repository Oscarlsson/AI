What I love about this case is its softness and its superior quality. It fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it. (I have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras). This one seems to be an improved model. 
It does not need to have handles because you are supposed to use the strap on the camera. Highly recommendable
