  I bought this dock from a seller called Miga.  They did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition.  I use the dock for my HP R817.  Having read the reviews regarding the insert I just went through HP's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera.  It was only $5 (before shipping) and it arrived the same day as the dock package.  The dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $50 and up by itself from HP.  I bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when I go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit.  I probably won't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock.  But for what I will use it for its an excellent product for the price and I highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there.
