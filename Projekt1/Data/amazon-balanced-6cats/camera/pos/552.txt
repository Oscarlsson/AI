I originally bought the Edit 120 (no detachable case) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often (to leave at home).  Then I came across the Edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly.  Not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet, I was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment.  It needed to be easy to remove, but it also needed to be secure; the pictures I found on the internet didn't show how it was attached.  

I was relieved when I actually saw how it was attached.  There is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag (an open slot is at each end).  The add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro.  The attachment method is secure and is almost invisable, and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag.  I think the original bag is very good, and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice.  

Unfortunately, you have to buy this as a combination.  If you originally bought the 120 single bag version, it doesn't have the slotted bottom on it and can't be retrofitted (and I don't think they sell the detachable bag separately)
