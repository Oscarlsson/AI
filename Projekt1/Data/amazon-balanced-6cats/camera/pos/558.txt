Yep, we love this camera! Amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to Las Vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip. The still shots are amazing, you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera couldn't. In fact we tested this and have proof, as we had both cameras with us. My son got a great close up of Star Jones from far across the gathered crowd, right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her, and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you can't even tell what the subject was! I love that we have two cameras in one, video and stills, so we don't have to carry both. I really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power doesn't threaten to wipe the memory clean. We eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip. It would be nice to have a separate battery charger, but it really didn't get inconvenient, we'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up. And the price was excellent for all the features we got. Yep, we love this camera
