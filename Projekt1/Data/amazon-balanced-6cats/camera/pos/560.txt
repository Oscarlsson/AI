I have been using the Fuji E550 for almnost two years, with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers. 

Here are the negatives: 

1) The flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky. If you don't depress the shooting button all the way, it may not flash. 

2) In bright light, the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image. BUT the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue.

The positives:

1) It takes great pictures. Really excellent.

2) It's small, and easy to carry.

3) The controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body. Very easy to use. 

4) It has several automatic modes - sports, landscapes, portrait, etc, or you can use it on manual. I always use one of the programmed modes. 

5) The video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old (now 13) uses it.

I was so pleased with this camera I bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago, and she is very happy with it.

At it's current price I think this camera is a bargain. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the weak flash.
