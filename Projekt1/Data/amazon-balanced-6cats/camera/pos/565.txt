I was amazed on how well this battery has performed. I did make sure when I got it I did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since. I can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder (Sony HDR-HC1). It is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but I use the LCD when shooting anyway, and almost always on tripod
