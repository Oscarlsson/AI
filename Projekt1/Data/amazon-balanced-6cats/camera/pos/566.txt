I have the Sony battery that came with the camera and bought an additional Sony battery that allowed for 2-4 hours. However, I wanted a battery that I could count on for the better part of an "all day" event and I found it in the QM91D.  

I was asked to photograph a wedding from getting ready (hair dresser at 0830, until the end of the reception at 11:30pm) The QM91D held strong.  I did not constantly video tape, but with my digital recorder I had 6 sony 120 tapes (60 min digital) -- 5 were captured using the QM91D.  I did switch some of the tapes before they were completely used to make sure I didn't miss important events ... so I never actually used up "all" of the QM91D battery.

This battery was used again during the evacuation from Houston (secondary to Hurricane Rita) -- I used it entirely and it did not faulter ... it lasted throughout the trip and I had no need to change to the smaller batteries.  

The size of the battery did not really bother me -- I was aware that it would be larger than the others and it did not hamper the use of the camera.

Read the manufacturer information on battery life, charging time etc ... for this battery it is valid.  

I would recommend this battery.
