I purchased this kit, primarily for the extra battery, which retails for about what I paid for this item.  Having the backup battery is great, but I was pleasantly suprised by the soft case.  It protects my DSC-P200, without being bulky or heavy.  With the camera being so small, it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money.  The case for the memory sticks is nice as well.  It is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely.  All in all, this is an excellent value
