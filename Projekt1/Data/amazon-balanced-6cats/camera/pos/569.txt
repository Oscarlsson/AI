The camera is good. Had it 1 week now. Low light it works and produces fair results. Bright light is much better. Small and light weight. You must use the supplied docking station to transfer as ther is no USB port on camera . There is the  DC in and TV out on camera (as well as the docking station...just no usb...why? ) 30GB hard drive is plenty...maybe too much. If you fill  this up you are looking at 8 DVD's and hours of transfer. The software is weak and conflicts with Roxio 7.5.  Roxio became unusable.  Roxio stinks anyway.  Found a simple program to burn after this...ASHAMPOO. Plan on getting Adobe Premier Elements, too. Amazon had the best deal...89 less 30 mail in rebate from Adobe.  Much better then the software in box.  My first cam as we now have a cute baby.  Easy to keep it rolling and have gigs to save.
