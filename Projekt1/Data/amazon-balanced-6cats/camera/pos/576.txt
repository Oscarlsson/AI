After reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the PSC-55, I was still undecided on a case for my Canon SD630.  So, I purchased both to see for myself which one would work.  Because red is my favorite color, I really wanted the red case to fit (PSC-90).  The camera will fit in the case, but it's a VERY tight fit.  I had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close.  The PSC-55 is still a very snug fit, but allows for some extra breathing room which I feel is better for the safety of the camera.

In addition, here's something to consider if you're deciding between the two cases: the inside lining of the PSC-90 is more of a rigid nylon material, while the lining of the PSC-55 is a softer felt material.  The case overall is still rigid, but I like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining.  Based on that alone, I'm going with the PSC-55 - I feel that this will be more friendly to the 3" screen on the SD630.

Both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive - I'm pleased with the Canon brand
