when it comes to buying camcorders, i personally like the one with the build in memory. but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind. 
unlike other sony camcorders, first of all, it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot. its a good use of your money. you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there. easy to use, touch screen, takes still photos, has a good speaker so it's easier to record video and voice, fits into your palm so to speak, and if you use rewritable mini dvds, you wouldn't have to worry about go out of memory. 
 so when it comes to sony camcorders, i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly.
