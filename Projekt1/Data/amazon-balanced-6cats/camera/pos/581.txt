 This is my first digital camera. Prior to this I had a simple Kodak point-and-click model which pretty much the quality of a disposible.  I use much higher grade cameras at work both 35mm and digital.  This camera gives you the 5.1 MP ability though most shots only require the 3MP.  I like the 32MB internal memory though I've also bought a 256MB card for traveling. The 5x zoom isn't as cool as I initially thought it would be and digital zoom works sometimes and not others but you must understand what digital zoom really is.  The camera takes very clear and optimal pictures. Better pictures then I've taken on anything else I've owned before (and some of the work cameras as well).  The size is small enough to put in your pocket but not too small for one with larger hands. The different flash options and shooting scenes can turn difficult pictures into what you want to capture.   The panoramic shot sequence is an especially favorite feature especially for shoreline shots.  I've also bought the R-Series dock and enjoy its ability to transfer my pictures faster and charge two batteries at once.
  This camera is worth the price you pay but I believe its a 2005 model so it may not be the most up to date but it does a great job.
