When I sow this in Amazon and read the spec. and everything on it I knew this is exactly what I'm looking for. It's portable, handy, and it's easy to use. The video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too. You can even download MP3 Music and use it to make music video, or any music of your own. Here's what you do,  Output the audio to a power Amp/ speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video. shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the MTV Music Video
