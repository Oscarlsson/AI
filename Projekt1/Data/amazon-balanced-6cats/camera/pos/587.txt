This camcorder is the best I have ever had!I have 5 others all higher and lower priced models for my business, I do video photography as one of my jobs. I love this camera, I dont know what would do without it! My kids can even operate it, we have made so many quality movies at home. I also use this camcorder for paid wedding and special occasion videos, it works great and I love the brand I really perfer it to others. Its not for you if you arent going to use alot or have a problem with the size, I dont think it's that big but then again I use some equipment thats enormous. This is not a palm Caamcorder. 
Once you figure out if this is the camera for you, you will be please, I enjoy it a lot!! There are descriptions of the camcorder, options and quality of the product on this page.
I love it and hope my short review helps. I know this is a non-detail review but all the info is on this page. This isnt for a person looking for a $400 dollar camera, if you want quality movies or use it for your job, ect. I really think this one is great! Hope this is useful, Camcorder Fanati
