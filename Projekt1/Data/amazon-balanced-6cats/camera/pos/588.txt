I had been searching web site after web site for a system like this.  I finally found a site where I could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system.  However, the receivers alone were more than this unit( If you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma).  This works great.  Could not be easier to install.  All components are in my basement.  I ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate, with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate.  The blue light still shines through the faceplate, which is perfect. The faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set.  No interference.  This set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen.  Works great with a basic $20 all in one ir remote. Also, the customer service is like no other.  I had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help.  Made this purchase a no brainer. This is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews.  I highly recomend this product.
