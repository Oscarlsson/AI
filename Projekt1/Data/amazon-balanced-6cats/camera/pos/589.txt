I have a wall hung plasma TV with speakers from my surround system mounted on either side. I was able to locate all the receivers in another room for a super clean installation. The Hot Pro IR target is very sensitive!! Initially I had the Hot Pro "box" too close to another TV and the blue indicator light was always on. If it's glowing, you need to move something. Once the indicator isn't lit but flashes when you use your remote, it works flawlessly
