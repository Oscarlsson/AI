I gave this monopod to my boyfriend, as a gift, and it's been perfect for his use.  He videotapes his kids's baseball and softball games, and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long.  He didn't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down, so a monopod seemed like a great idea.  He has LOVED it!!  He says it keeps the camera very steady and it's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing.  He's no professional, but he uses his camcorder a lot, and he'll be happily using the monopod for a long time
