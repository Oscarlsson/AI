The only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus, especially where there is not adequate light.  Aside from this it is a good but not great lens.  It is probably worth the money that it cost, however, I believe that a better lens would be the 70 - 300 MM VR which costs about 4X the price of this lens
