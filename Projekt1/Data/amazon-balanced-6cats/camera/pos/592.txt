The GS150's performance is as-advertised. Terrific colour rendering, thanks to its 3-chip configuration. The camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings, making it even more usable. Love the joystick! Still find it hard to believe that Panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package.

Final Score: Engineering 1, Customer Service 0

Early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem, which causes faint, red, horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions. Despite the fact this has been widely (if unofficially) reported by GS150 owners around the world, these same owners have noted that Panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists.

Thankfully, the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician. Better still, GS150 owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from September 2005 onward are alright. Look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with 'H5' or higher. You can also read all about this at pana3ccduser dot com
