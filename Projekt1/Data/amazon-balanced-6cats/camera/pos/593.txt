I had to decide between this camera and a Panasonic.  we trust the Sony brand a little more, so we went with the Sony.  We were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later.  I also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations.  

Here's what I think so far:

Great camcorder to do exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside and out, VERY easy to use, and small enough to carry along almost anywhere.  

Still photos are not fantastic (only 3MP), but good enough for me.  Color and resolution are acceptable.    

Not easy to understand the LCD touch menus, but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most.

I got the bare minimums for accessories...bought a 1GB memory card (memory stick duo pro)...glad I did this since I will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents.  Also got a carrying case, DV tapes, and an extra NP-FP71 battery.  I'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon (I'm sure you've heard, the USB cable is inadequate for downloading video).  

Handycam station doesn't really bother me that much, but I can see what the fuss is about.  

All things considered, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  I think this is a perfect camera for a first-time camcorder buyer who needs an EASY button (there's one on the side of the camera).  A little more expensive than some of the others, but the price is dropping.  

Best of luck!
