I've owned the p-73 for about two years now.  One thing I'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews, is that after a year or so, the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely.  For me, this hasn't happened with this camera.  It's always been great, and it has a lot of really convenient features.

When I bought this camera, I knew NOTHING about cameras.  I just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was PRETTY.  I got really lucky--I mean, I only bought it because it was pretty--I knew nothing about it.  But, nonetheless, I got lucky and bought this camera that takes AA batteries, came with a battery charger and its own USB cord.  It had a ton of settings on it.  Now that I understand more about photography, I really like the manual setting--the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10-15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class.

Like I said, i never had any problems with it.  Batteries always lasted long; took little time to recharge.  I never even bought a memory card for this camera--I use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that's all the given memory card can hold, and my pictures are still decent quality.

I'm now looking into a new camera because I do want excellent image quality, and, ironically, ever since I've been shopping for a new digital camera, my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take; weird.

Anyway, if you're looking to buy a sony digital camera, based on my experience with this one, I'd recommend the brand
