Solidly built, this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier Sony Cybershots like the DSC-R1. The remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake, which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified (high optical zoom, supressed flash, etc).

What surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any Sony Cybershot : press halfway to focus, and all the way down to capture the shot.

The zooming buttons do not work for the Sony DSC-R1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring, but they should work fine with any other Cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course, an ACC terminal.

Highly recommended.
