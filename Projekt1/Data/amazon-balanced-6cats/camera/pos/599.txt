This is why sony is hot! This sexy little (yes its really small the size of a pack of cards) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation, make sure to get a memory stick with it though, because w/o it it only holds about 15 pics. This is my first digital camera and I would definitely buy sony again
