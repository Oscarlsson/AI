If you've found these reviews, you already know this lens is one of the best Canon products out there. I did not bite on the IS version, and I have not found myself ever wishing I did; this lens is everything it's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light/indoor situations.

I don't think it's weight is that big a deal. I really don't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day -- in my hands or in a bag -- even with a 1.4 extender attached. It can feel a bit heavy but I don't mind, and neither will you when you see the results later on.

I've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it's landed me front page ink several times. In my mind, I could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range, which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography, considering the 300 f/2.8 and it's friends are much, much more expensive. The lens works basically just as fast and sharp, in my opinion, with the 1.4 at f/4, although some may debate this. Flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro.

If you can swing the price, enjoy it! My advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products, although I found most everyone agreed, this is one of the finest lens around. It's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are
