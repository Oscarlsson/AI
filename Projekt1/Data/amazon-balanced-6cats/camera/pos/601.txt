There some very detailed reviews, most of which I read before I ordered the camera from Amazon.  There is ample evidence that professionals will find the camera useful.  I want to take a minute to speak for the rest of us. The camera came a month ago and I've extremely happy with it.

Let me offer some perspective on my comments.  The last camera I bought was a small SONY shirt-pocket-sized camera that I was using alot and it got me back into taking pictures.  I decided that since I was taking so many pictures I wanted a camera that would take much better quality shots, WITHOUT my having to get a PhD in picture-taking.  I opted for this camera with the 18-200mm lens.  I now take the same pictures I took with the small camera, but with the zoom lens I can frame them better and with the 10.2 mega pixels I can blow them up and frame them. 

There are dozens (hundreds?) of features that I will grow into, but for now I am delighted to use this camera right out of the box, with just minimal reading of instructions.  Everything I remember from my 35mm days (my first camera was a Minolta SRT-101 that I bought in 1973) can be put to use, but what I forget, the camera remembers.

My point--this is a camera that is ready to meet you wherever you are and grow with you should you decide you want to go farther out and deeper in
