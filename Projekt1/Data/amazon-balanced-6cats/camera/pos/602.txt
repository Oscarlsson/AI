5 stars...easy to use. The screen is large and clear. The automatic settings include a variety of scene selections (ie beach, party, fireworks scenes).  I have yet to use the video, so I cannot comment on that. I think this is a great all-around camera, and it fits in the smallest purses...big plus.  The screen has yet to get scratched in all my purse juggling.  

My only complaint would be in the shipping.  I paid extra to expedite my order since I was leaving the country a few days later. It was sent via UPS with a signature "in person" required.  When I missed UPS the first time, I was unable to just sign the paper and leave it on my door.  I had to contact UPS to find out when they would return so I could sign in person, which was an ordeal.  I wish I would've known that the camera was being sent this way.  I would've requested that no signature be required.
