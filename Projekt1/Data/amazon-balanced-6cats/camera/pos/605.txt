At first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples, but I found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better. Also, the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away. Just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution. After a few practice downloads I was thrilled with the results. **Another plus: this one came with a wall charger. Most have to be plugged in to the USB to charge. The wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you're away from your computer
