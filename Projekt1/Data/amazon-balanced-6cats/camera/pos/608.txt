For less than $200 this is a great camera.  It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The "anti-shake" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).   It's pocketable, portable, and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it.
