It is light; has 6X magnification; and easy to use.  This little tool is great for any golfer.  You must know the yardage before you can select the correct club.  How far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick?  Next,you just then need to pull the club that will get you there.  Fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag.  These NEW laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models. LOVE IT
