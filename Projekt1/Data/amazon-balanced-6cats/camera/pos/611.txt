I got a Nikon laser rangefinder for Chrisymas and it had an 8x magnification. I found this to be to powerful for golf.I could not hold it steady on the flag.The 6x magnification on the Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout was much better. Also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart. The price from Amazon was well below I could find anywhere else.
