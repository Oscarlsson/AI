This is a very good camcorder with the main problem I noted being the DVD format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in HD mode per disk. It is also a problem that only Blue-Ray DVD players can play back the DVD in HD mode. Even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player. Nevertheless, the price was good and I think Blue-Ray will be more affordable in the near future. Meanwhile, I can playback my video directly or send it to the computer. I am glad I bought it. If a MiniDV tape version were available at the same price now I think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though. I was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but Sony sent a new one right away. Be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it. Overall - I am very happy with the camcorder
