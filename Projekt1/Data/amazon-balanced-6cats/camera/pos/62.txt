my cousin's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing / lifestyle photoshoots (I've been pretty active in this area for some time, just now starting to go full digital), and I've used the f/2.8L about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses I've used. period. shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots, as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots (of crowds, the freeway at night, etc). when shooting action shots, the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing, but it can be removed easily enough.

I personally just purchased the f/4.0L, which, coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20D, should do nicely, but I still rate the 2.8 high up on my list
