This camera delivers excellent video quality.

I use it with the hot-shoe attachable microphone and the audio is quite good.

I've plugged this into my HD television and the quality is excellent.  I have also had the Optura Xi from Canon and while the build quality of the HV20 is not quite as good as that of the Optura Xi, the video quality is nothing short of stunning.

This is a very good deal for $1000.  You won't be disappointed
