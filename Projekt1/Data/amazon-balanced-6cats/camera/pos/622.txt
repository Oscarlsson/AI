I mainly use the camcorder for recording my kids.

I bought this camcorder a couple of weeks ago.  I had the sony hc-7 before for a couple of weeks which I returned to buy the canon camcorder.  

The high light performance of both camcorders are excellent.  With the sony camcorder, I felt that the best color performance can be achieved by reducing the color intensity.  The low light performance when recording 1080i is similar for the two camcorders but much better with canon when recording in 24p format.  This is the main reason that I prefer the canon.  The 24p recording is more sensitive to motion which can be a problem if recording motion.

The still images from canon are lower resolution but to me they looked better than sony.  This is especially true when taking flash pictures.  
The sony seems a little better built.  The hdmi cover on canon is poorly built.

I liked the controls on canon better than sony.
The auto focus and automatic white balance worked better in canon than in sony.  The auto white balance in sony worked poorly in indoor light.

Sony has supershot infrared recording and canon does not.

Sony has more manual controls than canon.
