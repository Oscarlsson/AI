This is the perfect gift for any occasion.I bought one for my husband for his Birthday and he took it to work next thing you know everyone was on here buying theirselves one.It is a very easy thing to load pics on and hook up to your TV.He sales cars and hes got his on his desk showing his family off and cars that they also have on the lot for the older people who are unable to withstand the heat so they sit right at his desk and check every car out on his Digital Frame.I give this frame an A++++++
