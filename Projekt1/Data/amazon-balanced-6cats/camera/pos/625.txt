This review is for the Coolpix 5900 with 5MP. 
You will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the 
market for a compact digital camera. This little baby lies 
comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails 
to deliver, no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it's 
path. The footprint is amazingly small for a 5MP and you'll be 
amazed at the functionality. I found the video/movie feature to 
be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great 
clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light. 
Think of Las Vegas lights on the strip, or a crowd of people 
in thin night light. This camera handled it all. The SD card 
is easy to access, and I recommend a 1GB size so you can take 
your time with movies. Otherwise a 512MB card will give you 
about 300 photos. But I warn you, you will be bitten by the 
movie bug and want to use this more and more (provided you have 
disk space or burn the excess to DVDs). I also recommend the 
San Disk Ultra II SD cards for fast recovery speeds, so you 
don't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the 
next shot (this is 5 MP and that's a lot of pixals to store). 
The roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight 
grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras 
lacked. The battery life is exceptional, but as always, buy a 
backup for travel. The hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button. I know they designed it so that it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket, but my fat finger is not the best tool.... The 2 inch LCD is not protected like others too, but so far seems pretty tough, rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it.
