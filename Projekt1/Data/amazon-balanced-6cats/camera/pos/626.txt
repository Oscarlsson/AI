I have a Canon EOS Rebel which takes fantastic pictures.  I use it around home and when I am setting up static shots such as family portraits.  The only problem is...who wants to lug it around to take snapshots.

Despite some of the above opinions about lack of sharpness, I have had no such problems.  The 5900 is great for "grab" shots and it's not too shabby for setting up a planned shot using it's advanced controls. 

Be sure that you buy a FAST memory card.  This will reduce the time between shots.  As in most cameras, a memory card is not supplied with the camera.  Mr. Goyal's review about not being able to take pictures without a memory card is not true.  You can take a LIMITED number of shots with the internal memeory. 

The only real problem I have is the red-eye reduction feature.  I usually turn it off as the delay between the "red-eye" flash and the main flash is too long.  The subjects often think the shot is over and start to move.  Anyway it is easy enough to remove it later, either with photo-software or with the photo kisok in the drug store
