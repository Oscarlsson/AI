Got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well!  More than 3000 great pictures have been taken.  The camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance.  A word of caution - ensure that the camera doesn't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it.  The spring-operated shutter is very sensitive.

Would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera
