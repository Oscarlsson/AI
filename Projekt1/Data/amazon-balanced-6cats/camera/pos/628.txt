This is a nice bag, but don't buy it for a Canon S2 IS it will not fit.  The product compatibility lists the S1 IS since the S2 and S1 are very similar I purchased this bag.  I can't even get the thing in the bag.  It is a nice bag however and have put my smaller Kodak camera in it.  There is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it's accessories.  Good quality
