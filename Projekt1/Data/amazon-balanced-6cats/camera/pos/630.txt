Its a cable, it works, what else do you want?  I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says "sony" on it.  Yea!!  But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for.  Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market.  who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products.
