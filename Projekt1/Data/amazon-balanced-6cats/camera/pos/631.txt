This is my second digital camera. Although it does so much more than my first, it is much easier to operate. I especially love the fact that I can video my grandson's baseball game, and then convert individule frames to photos (jpeg) with great quality. I have a series of photos with him getting a hit. It looks great!

Thanks for a great product.
