We just got this camera after much research.  The camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it doesn't do some of what was advertised.  For the most part tho for the price and all it is fine.  Just read all the directions and don't be to disappointed if it doesn't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that.
I wrote to Sony and they said that this model doesn't do a few things.  SO MAIN POINT HERE IS READ AND READ AND KNOW WHAT IT IS.

I liked the service we received thru Amazon.  No problems ther
