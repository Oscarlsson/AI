Do not expect this to replace the zoom from your camera. It will not do that nor was it intended to do so. What it does do is optically bring things a little bit closer. This is certainly preferably to using the digital zoom that comes with so many cameras. 

The lens works by screwing into the end of the camera lens where filters would normally be put. This means that it is something which must be planned for to be used. It is not to be put on while filming is taking place; it is in place when filming begins. Since it is easy to use, this should not take too long. The normal zoom of the camera can be used while this lens is in place. Having it in place just changes the limits from a little bit closer to what would normally be the case to not quite as far when the camera is zoomed out to maximum. Care should be taken not to get this lens cross threaded when putting it in place.

The quality of the optics seem to be fine. I used it on a Sony DCR-VX2100 and had no problems.

This is a handy gadget to have handy in your case but be aware of what it will and will not do.
