I purchased this battery as a back-up to the one that came with the camcorder. The great thing about this is, once charged, it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power. I discovered this last week when I wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but ...surprise surprise. Its recharge time is very fast.

The only negative part (if I must have to give) is, it's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder.

I say go for it.
