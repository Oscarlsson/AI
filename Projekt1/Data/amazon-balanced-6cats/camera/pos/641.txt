This case is the perfect size to hold our Sony Camcorder and a few blank tapes.  We purchased it for a cruise, because we wanted to carry-on the camcorder and have it protected, but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories.  This smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras
