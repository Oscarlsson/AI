This is a very flexible and capable camera. If you are looking for more than a point & shoot will offer, there are very few that would compare. For me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle, if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing. the 16:9 is an ok feature if you plan on HDTV veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4:3. i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16:9 feature. the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside, i am very satisfied
