At least for now it is :-) .  During the course of the past 10-12 months I have owned 7, that's SEVEN, digital cameras: Canon S230; Kodak V530; 5 different models of Casio's: Z60, Z600, Z850, P700; and most recently presented my wife with a red S770 for Valentine's Day.  I also had a pretty good chance to evaluate Canon SD450 (my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and I to him for his 21st birthday), Casio EX-S600 (a good friend of mine owns one), and Panasonic DMC-TZ1 (once again, a gift from my wife and I to my father-in-law for his last birthday).  If you read any of my digital camera reviews (and I've written a few by now), then you know that I'm not particularly fond of Canon's lately - I think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer.  As I also mentioned before, I've tried several different Kodak models (and I used to work for the company too!), but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time, to say the least.  I became a big fan of Casio's, although not all of my experiences with them were great.  But being a huge gadget "freak" that I am, and constantly wanting new "toys", I have always craved for more.  Over time, my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control.  So one by one, I returned/sold all of my cameras, and after extensive (and I really do mean extensive) research, I got myself an LX2.  I must say though that I probably wouldn't have without getting to know my father-in-law's TZ1 first.  I was actually quite impressed with it.  Powerful zoom, sharp lens, decent picture quality.  I also played with some other Panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them, as well as spent a few hours on the phone, and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an FZ30, and who swears by it.  Unfortunately, LX2 was not available anywhere locally, but I felt that I got a pretty good understanding of what Panasonic's cameras are all about, and after some more thought and consideration, I went ahead and bought it from Amazon (nice thing about buying from Amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought, including digital cameras, within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked).  I did know about the "Noise" issue at high ISO's, but it wasn't a decisive factor for me, and I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway.  It turned out to be one of the best purchases I've made in a long while.  Here is why:

PROS:
- Superb design.  This camera is wonderfully crafted.  And I absolutely love Black!  It gives the camera a nice, clean, professional look.  I don't think I'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one;

- Intuitive controls, and menus.  I charged the battery, put it into the camera, and started using it and taking pictures right away, without even going through the manual once;

- A load of features, including a large, bright, widescreen LCD; wide angle, super sharp Leica lens with a 4x zoom; Mega OIS - optical image stabilization control (optical means it's done mechanically, which is a TRUE way of doing stabilizing, comparing to other cameras where it's done by "tricking" the camera into using higher ISO's); and many more.  In addition, it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus, has a number of manual controls, as well as provides ability to shoot in RAW format (more on that later);

- It comes with SilkyPix Developer Studio software for working with camera RAW files.  For someone who is not familiar with RAW - it's a "pure", camera specific picture format.  It varies upon a manufacturer, meaning that Canon RAW is different from Nikon or Panasonic RAW, for example.  And it's "pure" in a sense that it's of a much better quality than a standard JPEG (JPG), and doesn't suffer from loss of information, such as white balance, or brightness.  There is a lot more to RAW than that, and I'm not going to go into details right now.  What I want to say, however, is that having previously owned a camera which supported RAW format (Casio EX-P700), I must have tried about a dozen of different RAW editing software packages, including products from Adobe, Ulead, ArcSoft, PhotoFiltre, Picture Window Pro, ACDSee, LightZone, Image Broadway, and more. SilkyPix delivered by far the best results of all.  The only one that I would probably put next to it is Bibble;

- Noise - What Noise?!  I really hate it when I hear people complaining about noise in this camera (after having it tried myself), or any other compact digital camera for that matter.  Are you really that naïve that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera?  Think again.  You might have noticed that I've used the word "Compact" several times here.  I've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise.  Some cameras are better than others, but no matter how hard you try, you will see some.  This camera is no better or worse than any other one that I've had/tried.  At higher ISO's (above 400), it's slightly more visible, but who in the right state of mind is using anything over ISO 200 on a compact digital camera, such as this one, anyway?  I always have mine set to a 100.  If I feel that it doesn't get the job done, I shoot in RAW;

- Picture Quality is Very Good.  Yes, it does take some time getting used to, but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of, you can achieve spectacular results, especially if you don't mind doing some post processing.

As much as I like everything this camera has to offer, there are, however, some things that kind of irritate me.  Here is a short list of bad things about this camera, otherwise known as

CONS:
- First of all, this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented.  It's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera, which is not entirely true.  10.2 MP resolution is available ONLY in 16:9 (wide) aspect ratio.  Two more ratios are available - 3:2, and a more conventional 4:3, but those offer 8.5, and 7.5 MP resolutions respectively.  So if you compare this camera to others that don't have a widescreen format, or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode, then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 MP digital camera (because not all the pixels are actually effective).  Obviously, Panasonic is aware of it, and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose, to boost consumer's interest;

- I expected to see a compact digital camera.  What I got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than I expected.  I was really surprised to see how small, yet convenient to hold and operate, the camera body was.  What I didn't like, however, was the lens.  Not the lens itself, it's actually quite superb, but the fact that it sticks out.  I like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body.  I realize that it would probably loose some features, like the wide angle, and perhaps zoom, but I still wish it did that.  It would be so much more... umm... compact?!  The way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it.  Almost impossible, I should say.  I've tried a few, but they are either too small or too big.  I just can't find one that would fit right.  I put an order for an SLX1B case for it, which is specifically designed to fit LX1, and LX2 models, but I hear they are not that good.  We shall see;

- I'm not a big fan of a pop-up Flash.  I always keep forgetting to open it when I need to use it.  And it also seems a bit flimsy.  I'm treating it as carefully as I can, but I just can't stop thinking that it might break soon;

- I hate the Lens Cap!!!  There, I said it.  It's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it, but for now I'm not really happy with it.

SUMMARY:
Despite very few minor negatives, I think LX2 is probably one of the best, most innovative cameras on the market today, and I sure am glad to have one.  It offers more than any other camera in the same price range, and can even compete with some DSLR's when it comes to picture quality.  If you are someone like me, who wants to have more control and/or learn more about digital photography, or a DSLR user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere, then this camera is not be overlooked!  Highly recommended
