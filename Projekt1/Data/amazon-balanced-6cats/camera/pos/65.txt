I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me. 
I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens. 
I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens.
I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no "L" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did. 
In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase.
