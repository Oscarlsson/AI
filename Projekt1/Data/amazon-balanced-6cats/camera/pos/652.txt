I owned a Kodak for awhile and was pleased with the pictures however, my husband accidently fell while ice skating and broke my camera.  My family, knowing I love to take pictures, decided to replace my camera, but this time with a Sony Cybershot.  I have never been more unhappy with a camera.  Needless to say, I finally decided to purchase this Kodak Z650 and am so pleased with the results and pictures.

I am not a professional photographer, just someone who likes to take photos of my kids, pets, flowers, vacation spots, etc.  My Sony was HORRIBLE at action shots and if you had ANY movement what so ever, the photo appeared blurry.  Having kids, that isn't an option.  I gave that camera to my daughter to do whatever she wanted with it.  The Kodak, however does a wonderful job of action shots as well as clear, crisp and concise pictures.  I absolutely love this camera!  

I will never go back to another brand and have only good things to say about Kodak and their products
