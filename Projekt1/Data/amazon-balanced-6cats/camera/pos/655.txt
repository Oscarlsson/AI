If you use the viewfinder instead of the LCD field, it does not appear on the LCD, you can only see it through the viewfinder.  This is different from previous models.  Minor annoyance.

The quality of the videos was surprisingly good, but it saves them in the QuickTime .Mov format.  Mov is not my favorite format, but perhaps others will not be bothered by this.  

Although I had heard that the color on Kodaks is not natural, I have found it to be excellent.  The overall quality of the pictures is good.  

For the price, I think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers.
