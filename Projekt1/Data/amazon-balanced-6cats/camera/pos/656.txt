I stumbled across this little gem by accident.  I was picking up supplies at Office Depot and they had a Kodak Z650 (display model) on sale for under $100. It was a ridiculous impulse buy--I already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing I needed was another camera! But what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be! It's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old Olympus C-740. 

I had never seriously looked at Kodak cameras ... I always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are "serious" photographers. 

But I couldn't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need I wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots I was used to with my C-740.

There are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots, but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots. I've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it--something I've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras, including the C-740. Some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy, but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp. It handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that I've tried. 

At less than a third of the price of my Canon S2-IS, this little camera outclasses the others by a mile.

I stumbled on to a good find in the Z650 ... it's not going to give you DLSR quality photos, but no point-and-shoot will.  

This camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots.  I just wish someone would have given a good report on Kodak cameras before I spent a small fortune on the others
