The Bushnell Powerview 12x25 is a fine, small pocket-sized binocular.  Since my wife is an avid bird watcher, we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power.  Our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 Bushnell that we used for trips, so I researched, then bought this one from Amazon for her birthday.  She loves it.  The viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact, which makes it easy to pack for vacations, yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country.  We both highly recommend this, and other Bushnell products
