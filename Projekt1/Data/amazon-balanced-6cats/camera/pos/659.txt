I was using this lense for a week now with D50 and I can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lense is AWESOME. At 1.8f this lense should be fast enough for any semi-profesional (like myself). At 8f this lense produces the most sharpest photo ever and given that you shoot in NEF (RAW) format and use photo editor software (I use Nikon's Capture NX) photoes become master pieces. At 22f, outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person. I highly recommend this lense
