I was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this 50mm to be an excellent first choice. I love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do. However, the auto-focus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes. I've found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster, at least in low light.
