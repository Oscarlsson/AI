I would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to take video and pictures without the hassle of lugging around (and charging) two separate gadgets.  It takes excellent pictures, just as good if not better than any other digital camera I have seen.  I am also very pleased with the video - I found the software very user friendly and video was easy to transfer and edit on my computer.  The battery has a good life, I have had no problems having to stop and recharge it.  There is a nite mode that compensates (very well, I think) for low light video.  The camera is easy to carry around (it is smaller than my 35mm) and I am having no problems with the functionality - all in all a great idea and easy to use with great pictures and great video
