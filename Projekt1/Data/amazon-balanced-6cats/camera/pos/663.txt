I have no complaints. I have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable, fast, and gives me crisp, quality photos! The only option I wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures, but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality. Blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot. Everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun! I highly recommend this camera (especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments, with high quality photos). Excellent camera overall! ;
