The beauty of this charger is that it is 110/220v compatable, so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on European voltage.  I have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each.  Very few cheap US chargers offer this multi voltage compatability.  Lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors.  If you plan on traveling internationally, this charger is a must!
