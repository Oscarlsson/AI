I have been using Kodak cameras for years. This is my third Kodak digital camera. It does everything, including taking excellent close-up wildlifephotos. It is as easy to use as a point and shoot. However, it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera. It is well worth the money. Look no further this is the camera for you
