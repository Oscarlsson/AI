I got this camera so I could have more control.  I'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings...I haven't explored all the fancy settings much, but there are tons of them.  I really like the continuous shooting option so I'm more likely to catch a good action shot.  The wide-angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close-ups.  I think it's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos, but don't feel quite ready for an SLR
