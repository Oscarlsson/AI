This is a must have item for your kodak dig. camera.
It allows for filters, tele/wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw on attachment.
Apart from that the black metal enclosure compleatly covers the entire lens assemby, at any zoom or focal length.
This adds a very strong and valuable protection to your lens.
If you accidentally bang the camera against a hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens (camera) from destruction.  I always keep it on with a skylight filter, the skylight or a UV filter further protects the lens from impact, scratches and dust.  If used when the lens is not fully extended ex: wide angle to normal zoom, the adpter also helps block out stray light and acts as a light shade. Kodak aught to have this built into their camera as a permanent fixture, but alas they make extra revenue on their accessories.
Do Buy It!
