Seems Panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo DSLR market, with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with OIS. excellent pictures out of the box, menu operations are plentiful, NR can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for Aperture or shutter is very professional.

Leica lens is crisp and sharp, I shoot in Aperture priority with NR at minimal and the pictures even in Jpeg look like they have been post processed, simply amazing.

After experiencing this camera I sold my Nikon D80, attachment lens and soft pictures Nikon was giving me is unacceptable, i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped RGB3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the Panasonic.

High speed USB is my only complaint for data transfers, Noise reduction for higher ISO noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking, a 3" ,screen would be nice but maybe on the next model.

BTW, moon shots with the Raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical, hand held shots with OIS (image stabilization) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures, you actually have a telescope with OIS at your reach, simply amazing.

100% satisfied.
