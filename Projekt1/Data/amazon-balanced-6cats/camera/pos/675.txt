This is my third digital camera and by far my favorite. I purchased after having a very versatile but large (well large in the dimensions of digital cameras) digital camera. I needed and wanted a camera that I could easily carry w/ me at all times. This is perfect.

The Fugi Z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access. Just don't put anything else in that pocket! The one time I forget and did this I noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera.

As with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting. I have found, however, that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so I am still able to get good interior shots if I am willing to blind people (or my cats) for a few seconds.

The camera comes w/ a docking station that I have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera. I tend to just use a USB cable direct to the computer or a really cheap USB card reader that I can attach directly to my computers USB port.

I took this camera to Japan and it was great. I only had one day where I ran out of battery power but that was my own fault.

This is a highly recommended camera by me
