I decided I wanted this a while before i got it. As I read reveiws I realized majority of them were postive. There is nothing wrong with it, the microphone works really good but you can not watch your videos with sound on the camera. It can take around 300 some pictures and about 60 minutes of video on Super sine mode, where it uses the most megapixels. It is definetly something I would recommend for anyone
