I purchased the Axion 10.4" frame for my wife to replace a defective Polaroid frame from a different source.  The Axion stacked up quite nicely to the other "more expensive" frame.  The Axion is viewable from more angles than the Polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag.  Quality of the display is BETTER on the Axion and we have not had any technical issues.

PROS:
Brightness control
Color and Contrast of display
Ease of setup and operation
Good sound from speakers on music playback

CONS:
Slide show transitions are from top to bottom only.  Different transitions would be a nice feature.
Remote does not control volume of music.

Overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages.  We have been very happy overall with this purchase
