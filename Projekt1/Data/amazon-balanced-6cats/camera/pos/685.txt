This is NOT a high-tech digital frame. It doesn't play MP3's.  It doesn't come with a remote.  It simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode.  There's an "on" button and an "off" button.  There is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame (though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet).  It's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off.  If you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location, or choreograph your pictures with music, then this is not the frame for you
