Well, I'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the A/V world.

I bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up.  This is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you don't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up.   

Just buy and extra after market battery or two (and they're cheap) and some inexpensive analogue tape, and start recording away!

After you climb the learning curve, of course.  My one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive, and they're splattered all over the unit.  Be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing, but once you've got it down you'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays.  

Oh yeah, almost forgot, the microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good for an entry level unit
