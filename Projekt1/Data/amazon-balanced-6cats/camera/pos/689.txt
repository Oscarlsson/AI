One of the reviews I read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should've had them for her Celine Dion concert.  I took the suggestion and they were perfect!  They fit nicely in my evening bag and brought Celine closer to me as I sat in the Second Mezzanine at Caesar's Palace!  Not only that - but the price was right! I couldn't be happier!  Plus, now I have them for our next trip to Rocky Mountain Park to get up close and personal to some wildlife
