I really wanted a 3CCD model, but since I'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff, like a tripod, monopod, media, firewire adapter card, camera bag, etc. This fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere. Yes the USB connection does work, yes FireWire does work, although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version I was using, not the fault of the camera
