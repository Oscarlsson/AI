This is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish.  There are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber.  I have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it.  I use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography.  The quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release.  I bought an extra quick release plate so I can switch between two cameras.

Tilt only -- no swivel:  Amazon (and others including Bogen) calls it a Swivel Tilt Head, but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions -- tilting (up and down) and swivelling (side to side or panning).   This head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes.

The tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape.  When you are going to the portrait mode, there's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees.  However, when I want to go back to landscape, I have to hold it out and look at it to see if it's level.  A subtle click to know I'm there would be nice
