I am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price.  I add it and use it for landscapes, mountain views, nature images and such, and also for group pictures in family photos.   It does what is supposed to do: it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear, and in this way the pictures appear more natural -- a whole view and not a narrow frame -- with perspective and deepness also, quite similar it seems to me to what I see with my own eyes.   A very useful additional tool
