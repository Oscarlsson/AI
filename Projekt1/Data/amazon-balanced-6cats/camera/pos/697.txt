I purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera.  This is my second point and shoot digital camera since I have abandoned film.

It is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures.  It has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me.  I have used it on an entire week long vacation without re-charging it.

Kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less
