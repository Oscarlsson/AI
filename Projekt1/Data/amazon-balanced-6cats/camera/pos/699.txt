BOUGHT AS A GIFT FOR DAUGHTER IN LAW.  SHE LOVES IT.  SEEMS TO BE AN EXCELLANT ENTRY LEVEL CAMCORDER.  ENOUGH BELLS AND WHISTLES TO SATISFY MOST WITHOUT BEING EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE.  QUALITY IS GOOD WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM JVC.  OPERATION IS SIMPLE ENOUGH AND PICTURE QUALITY EVEN FOR JPEG INTERNET QUALITY STILLS IS SATISFACTORY.
