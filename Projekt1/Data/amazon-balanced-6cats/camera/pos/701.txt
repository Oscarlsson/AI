I went to Ritz Camera today and took a good look at the TZ3. I'll tell you, its pretty nice. The build quality is really  good, as a previous person mentioned. The body is metal. The dials and buttons click with precision, and have a nice resistance. It has a nice weight to it.

I took some nice shots in the store. I must have clicked off 100 pics. I'm impressed with it. If you want something relatively small, powerful and tough, this camera is for you. The 10x zoom is great, but on such  a small camera it is difficult to hold it steady enough(at least for me) to use the zoom too much. 

I love the build quality and style, so I may be biased. It's a nice piece of equipment. I cannot speak to the photo quality only having seen pics on the camera's LCD
