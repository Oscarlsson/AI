I have not yet used an FZ30 or FZ50, but I think this thing beats the pants off an FZ5 or FZ10 as far as image quality is concerned. Really nice camera. Has a nice dSLR type feel. 71% of people that check out the FZ20 here actually end up buying the FZ7, (as of today) but I do not believe the IQ of the FZ7 could hold a candle to that of the FZ20. Buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon. You can do a lot with 5 megapixels. 

I have found that the IQ of the FZ20 is very close to that of a dSLR
