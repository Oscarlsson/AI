I love this camera.  I have now traveled all over the USA, some places in Europe, and will be using it in China.  Lens is excellent.  I wish it were lighter weight, but can't have everything.  And this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom.  I have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else
