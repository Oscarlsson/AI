I have used the camera for three months, and absolutely love it! The pictures are crisp (even very close-ups), and the video feature is right up there. Sound pick-up is excellent. I have created two DVD's combining videos and still pictures. Folks have thought the quality was very good.

The battery life was rated very good, and I have found this to be true. I carry the camera with me nearly everywhere I go. People are impressed with the size.

Drawbacks? Because of its size, there are no connections from the camera to a computer, TV or battery charger. The docking station is small and lightweight. Because of the battery life, I have never been away from home long enough to need recharging.

I recommend the camera without reservations, and will look first to Casio in the future
