I have many traditional film SLRs including the original Pentax K1000 (fully manual), Canon Rebel XOS and a Canon Elph. When considering digital SLR cameras the Canon Digital Rebel and  the point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph were at the top of my list. But at $150 less than the Canon Digital Elph, the Casio Exilim  EX-S series is a better buy with the the same features (and in some cases a better execution of the same features). If you're looking for a fun point-and-click camera that will record audio, AVI movie files and digital pictures this is it. It takes about 15 miuntes to read the manual and you're off taking pictures. Pay attention when reading the manual and everything else will seem very intuitive.
Of all the cameras I have I use this one most often. 

Other users have complained about the proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents are available right here on the amazon site, you just have to look. My back-up battery was only [...] bucks. San Disk 1GB memory cards are cheap too, [...] online, [...] retail. Last, I agree with many users that a lock switch needs to be developed so that you can keep the camera from accidentally turning on when it's in your pocket -- but remember many cameras have this problem/lack/this feature. I solved my own issues by buying a [...] case with a belt loop
