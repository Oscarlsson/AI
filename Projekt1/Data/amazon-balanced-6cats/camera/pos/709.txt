This is a great, easy to use camera. I have had this camera for a year and it has seen alot of use. The only drawback I have had with this camera is that it eats AA batteries. I bought rechargeable AA's and they seem to last forever! Problem solved. I am about to purchase a second one for my son for Christmas. Great camera
