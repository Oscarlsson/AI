Reasons to buy it:

1. Cheap, a mere $140.
2. Packed with features. From complete auto mode (point and shoot) to fully manual mode. 4MP and 3X optical zoom good enough for most situations.
3. Picture quality is good. It's better than the other two cameras I own (Olympus C720 UZ and Sony DSC S600).
4. Compact. It's smaller than it looks in the stock photo.
5. Fast. Switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds.


Other things I liked about the camera:

 - Good ergonomics. Fits nicely in my hand, all the buttons are well placed and easy to access. I can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand.
 - Powerful flash. Enough to fill up a moderate size room.
 - Great video mode with sound. It also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your TV and watch the vidoes and pictures on your TV.
 - LCD is decent size and is fairly bright, which means it's even visible outdoors in the daytime.


Things I didn't like about the camera:

 - Manual could be more detailed. There is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide. But there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail.
 - The auto focus illuminator (for help in focussing in low light) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes. But the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions.
 - Does not come with a battery charger. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately.


I have owned the Olympus C720 UZ and the newer Sony DSC S600, but I think this camera is better than both of them.
