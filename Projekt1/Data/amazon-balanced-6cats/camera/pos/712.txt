I bought this camera in August. It is really well made and the controls are easy to navigate. I think it takes really good pictures, inside and outside. Who cares about video quality? Its a Camera, not a camcorder,lady. I think it is a really nice camera. Its really durable too. And it looks nice. I would buy it again. I researched a bunch of cameras before this one and I chose the Sony in the end. Its one step up from just taking everyday pictures. They look really pro. I'd buy it again
