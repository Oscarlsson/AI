I really enjoy this small, high quality camara. I purchased a 2.0 GB memory disk so I could take advantage of the 7.1 mega pixel.And I get great pix everytime.  I have lots of fun with it. Since its so small, it's easy to take everywhere with me. I also get lots of compliments on it's "Fashionable" sleek design.  I highly recomend his camera.
