I've had a ton of these, and I take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields.  I've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud, taken it out, shot a few pics, put it back in the pocket with no problem.  (See pictures for examples of "mud photos")

A couple of times I've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off, but still had beautiful pictures every time, no jams or over-exposures.  

I've found the two pack at WalMart on sale for $8.99 a couple of times, and you absolutely cannot be that deal. 

This is my favorite disposable camera, and I've tried them all.
