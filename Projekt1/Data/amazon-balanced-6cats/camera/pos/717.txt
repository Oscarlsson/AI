High ISO and large screen were the reasons for my purchase. The screen is great but, when you force the ISO 1600, it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800. I have a S5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an ISO is set w/o having to go to full Manual option. Definitely something to improve! The auto option seems to work much better and I was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works. Also, the two picture function(it takes two with slightly different sets automatically) saves me on a lot of 're-posing
