This is a great lens for any user, professional or amateur.  This lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results.  A slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm (16mm cropped) but this is easily correctable with software.  In addition, the very fast and absolutely silent USM is a huge plus.  I highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots (especially realtors)
