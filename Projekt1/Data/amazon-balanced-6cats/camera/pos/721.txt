It's pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we're seeing...

In short, for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras (Panasonic DMC-FZ50, Fuji S9100) you can have this camera with the 2 kit lenses. I imagine that you'll be very satisfied for paying the difference.

8MP with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $650 as of 4/2007, and an upgrade path to the E-510 for all the lenses and accessories. Once you make that upgrade, what's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing. That's 10MP, IS in-body, SSWF and live-view.

IMHO, even if you're an "entry-level" DSLR user, spend the extra $400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens. The 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens, with no real peers in the entry-level DSLR range as a kit lens that I could see without going 3rd party. This lens put Olympus over the edge for me. For that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range (28-300mm), I'm not sure what else can compete on price. 
If you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom, you could cough up the $800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5, and even then, that's a very, very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range.

The camera has full manual controls, as expected from a DSLR, and can drive a newbie like me nuts, but can also keep it simple with it's auto mode and numerous scene settings (which I use a good deal).

If you get this camera, IMHO, don't bother with the xD cards. They are very slow in comparison to the less expensive CF cards in this camera.

When it comes time to get a flash, go the extra mile and get the Olympus FL-36 over the FL-20. I'm not sure that the FL-50's warranted at this price point. I was lucky to find one cheap, so I didn't have to research 3rd party flashes.

I confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-ISO samples from this camera to the Canons and Nikons of the world. It's definitely not bad in direct comparison, but after you're done resizing and touching up the photos, you'll never notice, IMHO. On the down side, the RAW files (.ORF) don't seem to be compressed, and they're not exactly small at 14MB.

All in all, not much to complain about here
