I don't like pink so I bought the blue bag.  I had bought a black one, but it was so skimpy I returned it and prayed until this one arrived. I had no trouble with Amazon crediting me for the return, either.  It was so cute!  I'm too old for "cute," but I kept it because I needed a case for my new HP R717.  It is small, yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it.  I have dropped my camera and it was not injured.  It has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera, not the big AA batteries, but the flat type that come with my R717.  I recommend this little bag, or the pink one, even if you don't like pink...or blue.  They are well cushioned and snug, but not too snug you think they will tear.  The are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures
