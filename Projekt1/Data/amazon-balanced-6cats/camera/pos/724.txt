I bought this camera to take pictures of my sons playing basketball.  My other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor.  I have had a lot of success with this and really nice outdoor shots as well.  What I just started playing with, and I love is the video feature.  It is so easy to use and the images are better than I expected.  I bought this camera in December as a present to myself and I have used it constantly and recharged the battery twice.  This is major to me as my Nikon was devouring batteries in an afternoon.  The optical zoom is clean, but the digital is definitely noisy. I have had fun shooting pictures of my kids because the shutter speed is so quick and I don't miss the shot.
