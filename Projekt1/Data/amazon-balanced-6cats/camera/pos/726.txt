Combine the high ISO, low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light AND MOVING SUBJECTS. This is what only Fuji can offer to you on compact camera class.

The F31fd doesn't have IS (Image stabilized lenses or a CCD shift sensor), which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking. But this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom, for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact P&S you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results.

IS also can't prevent blur from moving subjects. With a High ISO like on F31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too. 

Fuji Super CCD sensor provides the lowest noise on High ISO you will find on 2007's compact cameras, the quality is only comparable to the big DSLR professional cameras.

Ah, and the Face Detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal... it's really great, specially if someone who doesn't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you, with F31fd they will not miss the shot
