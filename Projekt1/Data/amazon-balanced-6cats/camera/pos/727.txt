I got a pair of these for Christmas. Initially, I was skeptical about the quality of an inexpensive roof-prism optic, and this isn't my favorite brand name either. But contrary to my expectations, I've been extremely impressed with them so far.

Good brightness, contrast, sharpness, field of view, and close focus all exceeded my expectations for a binocular at this price point. Feel, fit and finish are all very good.

I wear eyeglasses, and these binoculars still deliver a nice wide view through the eyepiece. The twist-down eyecups are quick to extend / retract if you are sharing these with someone who doesn't wear glasses.

They come with a decent carry case, and relative to porro-prism types, the weight and compactness are both a little bit better.

If you are looking for a good binocular for birding or general use, I highly recommend you take a look through these in addition to the other popular models. I think these really hit the sweet spot for price / size / weight / performance, and I'm very happy with them
