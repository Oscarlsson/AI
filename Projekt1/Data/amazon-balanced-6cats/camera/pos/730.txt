My bother-in-law and I went to Africa on safari last year. We had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting. The optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states. Our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt. They were so impressed by the IS and price that we left a pair with our hunter. He used them for the entire season last year, and when he visited "The States" last month, he reported that they are still doing well
