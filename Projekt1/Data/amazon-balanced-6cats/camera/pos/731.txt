The ergonomics: Perfect. The D200 is not completely rubber-encased. There's rubber where your hands need to hold it, and plastic where your hands rarely touch it. The hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in.

The battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic, and hinge-pinned. A simple slide latch opens the battery door....and some have warned the latch could be easily (accidentally) tripped. The memory card door latch, however, uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch.

USB 2 and Video Out/DC-in doors are made of flexible rubber, and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves.

The English language operating manual is a work of art. Each operating concept is alpha' & numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram, and to the page where the function is explained in perfect English. The reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized. 

I like the depth of field preview, the mirror lock-up, and the multiple-exposure capability. 

The continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object. 

If you have the old manual-focus, film-based Nikon SLR lenses from the '70's and '80's, except for a few rare exceptions, will fit on the D200.

All these positive attributes remind me of the best, most highly-evolved film camera SLR's. No wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media.
