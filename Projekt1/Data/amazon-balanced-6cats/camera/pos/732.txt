I have the white one (black was unavailable at the time of purchase)

1.  The camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet. It is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle.

2.  Durable. No scrapes or scratches in 7 months.

3.  Haven't missed the belt clip option, its small enough to fit in my pocket

4.  Well constructed/durable.  People think its some sort of iPod case/holder
