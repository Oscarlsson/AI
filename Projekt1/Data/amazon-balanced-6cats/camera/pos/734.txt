The picture is fine at this price.

I bought the Panasonic VDR-D100 for my daughter because she usually doesn't want to do anything with the computer like edit video. When we gave it to her the first thing she asked was, "can I edit the movies?" 

I did a quick test to make sure the DVDs would finalize and work on another DVD player with success on 3 computers and 3 DVD players. I didn't find anything the disc wouldn't play on.

Then I started up Vegas Movie Studio Platinum which I use to edit my miniDV movies. I selected IMPORT from DVD and it went straight to the miniDVD and loaded in the files where I was able to edit and add titles, music, sound effects and a voice over if I wanted to. 

Since I already bought DVD-R/W discs she will be able to reuse them if she ever edits the movies because you can unfinalize the discs and reformat them.
