I agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb, but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things, and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise, but an excellent compromise--the VR is an added boost--
I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back, because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--I don't want to keep changing lenses
