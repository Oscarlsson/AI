Pros: Compact and complete, this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it's reversible backdrop (gray/blue). I also have used the black back panel for some shots as well. Construction quality is good ( I found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel, which is fabric and held in place with Velcro tabs), sturdy enough for its intended purpose. I like the output of the lights--seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight.

Cons: Only one complaint: The output of the lights could be stronger. Requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture
