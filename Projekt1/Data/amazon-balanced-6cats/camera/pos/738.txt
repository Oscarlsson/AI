The Bushnell Perma Focus 7x50 Wide Angle Binoculars were the ideal choice for my recent trip to Tanzania and the Serengeti. They worked perfectly for the application needed. A really happy surprise on just how well these worked. As we bounced around on dirt roads and cross country in Land Rovers, the Perma Focus feature was outstanding and made things simple and easy! :-) The magnification level was perfect for almost every scenario we came across. Anything that was outside of about 80 feet came through in crystal clear vivid color and clarity. It really made for up close and personal viewing of all the animals we saw. By far, these were the best investment I made before the trip! I can't imagine being without them now on such an expedition. Really fantastic performance and a great value to boot!!!! The vendor was fast & flawless in the transaction too. In my opinion you won't be disappointed with these binoculars. Troy :-)
