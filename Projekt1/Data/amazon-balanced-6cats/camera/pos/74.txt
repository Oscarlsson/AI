I had the Tokina 12-24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens. This Canon focuses faster and is wider. If you're worried about full frame in the future don't be. Just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images. It light, fast and sharp. "L" quality pictures. The build could be better but I don't see any problems down the road.
