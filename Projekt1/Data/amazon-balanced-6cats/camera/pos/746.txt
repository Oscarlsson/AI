I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago.
I love using it.
It has lots of function to play with. It is easy to use.
I didnt have trouble taking good pictures in zoom mode outdoor.
Indoor, I had to use tripod if i use zoom.
However, i cant really think of any occasion that i have to use zoom indoor other than my testing last week.
Besides, it gives great pictures and I loved the price. I kind of considered DSLR camera but I gave it up becasue lenses were more expensive than camera itself. I considered one wide angle lense and one zoom lense. It would have cost me almost 2000 dollars
So far, I love this camera.
If this helps to anyone considering buying this camera, Id give two thumbs up.
