To All,

I just purchased the SP-550UZ after searching for the best camera bang for the buck - Olympus fills the bill..... 3/3/07 was my first day of use and I decided to check ALL the features - with the batteries supplied - still in use and a 2GB card - I took off for the outdoors and began shooting pictures at a local park - 300 pictures - including several 15 FPS and 30 FPS shoots and  three videos - 15, 30 and 45 seconds in length.

I am not a pro and will be using this camera for Sports, vacations and every day family events.

No Cons yets - I love the "SCN" feature - just select how you want to take the picture and the camera setups the camera - all you have to do is take the picture
