I got this camera for my birthday present in January and I'm extremely satisfied.  I'm very new to the entire "photography world", however this camera makes it easy to get into.  The camera is smaller than I expected, however it takes great pictures.  I use it often for pictures while we are on trips.  The picture quality is great, however screen quality isn't up-to-par with other brands.  This is a great value and I really like it.  My only complaint is that the Easyshare software is bad.  It's slow, outdated, and doesn't work well overall.  I recommend getting a 1 GB SD card.  I have 3 of them
