I've been using 35mm SLR cameras for over 30 years. For the last 9 or 10 years I have gone through several under $400 digital cameras as the technology has improved. This Kodak Z710 is a very economical compromise.  The built-in 10X optical zoom is a great feature.  
The Z710 does not have image stabilization (IS)as do some of the more expensive models but if you have a moderately steady hand and you press the shutter button rather than pound it (and the whole camera!) that's not really a problem.  
Another feature of this camera that I really appreciate is the manual settings position which allows much more creative control of a shot. Check out the Kodak web site for more information on this.  
I bought this camera from an Amazon dealer for less than $200 shipped to me.  That's cheaper than a reconditioned unit (same model!) recently sold on eBay
