I've been using the Sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and I am very pleased. At such a wide angle, you will most like need to "de-fish" your final shot which can be remedied with CS2 or some other image processing software. At 10-20mm, the range is almost too wide, but after further usage, I got used to it. I'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to. The only drawbacks I know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare (despite the marketing by Sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length. It is not a fixed aperture lens. I also find that this lens is at it's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and I wouldn't go beyond that because I started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens. But other than that, I've been pretty satisfied for the price I paid for this ultra wide angle lens. I still would prefer Nikon's 12-24mm, but I'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens. Sigma's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable
