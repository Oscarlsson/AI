Shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways, but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability, which, to me, is absolutely awful!

Personally, I hate zoom lenses. I've got a full set of Nikon primes. And while I'd prefer a prime lens, these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr.

I like this lens because it goes WIDE on digital. I suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives.

For anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end, unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time, 2mm is a SIGNIFICANT difference in field of view on short lenses. As the focal length increases (eg, from 400mm to 600mm), the difference in angle of view is not very large. But the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though "only 2mm" is no laughing matter, and if you don't believe me, you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself.

If you end up deciding to get a 12mm, you want to buy the sigma 12mm (I think it is 12-24mm?) because that lens covers full 35mm frame (and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing)!

Also, if Sigma or Nikon reads this review, please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime!

And if Sigma reads this review, I want some f1.2 or f1.0 AFD primes! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length! I would definitely buy (full frame coverage of course) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele! Neither Nikon nor Canon makes anything like that (well, canon kind of does/did), so you'd have the market segment dominated
