I have been shooting away for the last few weeks.  The Olympus 720 is a gem.  I must have filled up my card 3-4 times so far.  Being new to the digital camera era, I am finding that it is not as hard as I thought it would be.  Shoot, pop the card into the card reader, copy to computer, upload to Walmart's photo service, and I have my prints mailed to my house in a few days.  I am happy that everything was included with the kit.  I would have never known what I needed and it basically has everything covered
