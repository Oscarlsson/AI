This is a cool implimentation of a much needed device for those with D200s. The camera loves batteries. Having two is good!  Having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there's another on standbye is a fine feeling. Knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better! For a full day of shooting, you need this and some serious memory. Highly recommended. Also handles AAs... always good in field conditions
