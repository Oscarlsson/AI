I have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting. When up close, the image is excellent, but not so good for far away (more than 100-200 ft). Very easy to use, and the fact that it's waterproof is a plus (haven't dropped it in the ocean yet!). You can't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area, but out on the beach, with the moonlight, it rocks. Most of the time I don't even need the IR illuminator. To save power, turn it off, and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes. If you're looking to see things that are far away, this scope won't work well, but for things that are close by (say, from one end of the backyard to the other) it's a good deal. I put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case, since it gets bounced around on the ATV, and haven't had a problem yet
