I just bought this for about $190 at the local PX.  I am impressed so far.  I was going to buy the GS180, but for the sale price I would be crazy to pass this up.
SO far the low light is much better than a single CCD.  The video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape.  
I plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale.  
I will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around Europe.  I look froward to using this camcorder a lot
