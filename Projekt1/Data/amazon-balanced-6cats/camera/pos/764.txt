I bought this rangefinder for golf. It is small enough that I could keep it in my pocket. It really helps me with the approach shots to the greens. It takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag. I usually use a person on the green as my target. After I got an approximate read, I use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag. Be careful with the tiny battery cover. It came loose and I lost it on the golf course. Fortunately, I recovered it amongst the green grass. The cover is also green. I now put a tape over it to secure the cover.
