This rangefinder is great! Much lighter than the big bulky other units. Has all the great features that is needed. This is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it's too big.  I tested this against some of my buddies' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy. Great scan mode. Best buy.  Should be sold for about ($) more than asked for
