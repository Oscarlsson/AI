I bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it. It has all the basic functions her older Coolpix had abut more and they're a bit more user friendly. 
Pros: Compact and easy to Hold. I've had a few other Point and Shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand. This one feels pretty good. 
Cons: Before buying I read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be. I will agree. That is the cameras only real big down fall. Though my girlfriend may not notice it so much, to me it's a little more aparant.
For the most part, overall I really like this little guy..
