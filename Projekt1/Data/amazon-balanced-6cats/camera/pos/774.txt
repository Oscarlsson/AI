This is a really nice compact camera from Canon. The picture quality is excellent. I have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great. The zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for. The build quality is excellent and I really love the 3" display. I find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it. The camera is very compact but I never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand. The images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp. I would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original Canon battery and its available on Amazon. The accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original Canon parts especially the extra battery. Also get a SD card with large enough memory. What comes with the camera (32MB) is really a waste. Still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card. But overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results
