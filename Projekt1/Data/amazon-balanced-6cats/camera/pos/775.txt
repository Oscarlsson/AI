Takes great pics and the 3" screen is REALLY nice. Wall plug in recharger is nice also. I have taken pics outside in sunny, overcast, & rainy conditions. Indoors at sporting events and around the house. In all settings the pics have been truly wonderful. A few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics.

However, as Canon's top of the line Powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom. 3x isnt enough when other, cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom. Also Image Stabilzation should be included
