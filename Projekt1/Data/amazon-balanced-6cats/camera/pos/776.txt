Works better than I could have hoped.  I have used it for about a month and it is very simple to execute -- but you have to be able to hold somewhat steady which is not a problem for me.  If you are someone who has the shakes -- may be a problem.
  I have compared the accuracy to gps devices with guys playing with me.  This is better since it gives you the actual yardage to the pin.  Also, you can get yardage to another golfer in the field, and yardage to any object, bunker, tree etc., which the gps can't.  
   A lot of courses are not marked correctly, and, of course, yardage changes depending on how far off to the side of the fairway -- or even out of the fairway -- you are.  This is where it is especially nice.  There are times when without this device you are just flat out guessing.
   This is an awesome piece of technology.  It was well worth the price for me.
