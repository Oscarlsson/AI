This digital camera is the best.  I cannot complain about any aspect of it.  It has a huge amount of modes and settings and additional features to add to pictures as you are taking them.  It's small enough to fit into your pocket and not think about it (it's smaller than a wallet).  It takes excellent pictures that come out looking great, all very high quality.  The huge screen makes it easy to view what you are looking at and has great image quality.  The videos are equally good, with great sound and good picture.  It looks better than just about any other digital camera that I have seen.  Even though I said I cannot complain, there are a few things that slightly annoy me occasionally.  The first is that it flashes twice.  Remember to tell this to people before taking their picture!  After the first flash, people tend to look away, and by the time the second flash comes and the picture is taken, the moment is lost.  This only occurs when the camera is set to "AUTO" mode.  I usually press the menu button and choose a mode.  When you do this, the flashes occur very quickly (you barely notice a gap between them).  Some of the features are very useful.  I use the "backlight" mode quite often.  It allows you to take a picture of something even if there is a bright light in the background.  My only other complaint is for those of us with large fingers, the circular button that operates pretty much every feature can be difficult to use (sometimes I push 2 buttons at once, or the complete wrong one).  But everything else that this camera can do cancels it out.  This camera has more features and better quality than many larger and more expensive cameras out there
