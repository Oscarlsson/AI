Slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the S(40,45,50,...) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras.  Seems to charge in about the same time.  Feels a bit more substantial, but that's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy.  I can't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras (which I lost)
