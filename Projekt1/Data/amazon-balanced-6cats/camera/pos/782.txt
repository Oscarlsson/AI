I haven't used it much but the few photos I have taken are excellent. I'm not a photography expert so I'll leave the technicalities to others.  Telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount.  The high quality of this lens, as with the wide-angle, is obvious.  Comes with caps and a storage bag
