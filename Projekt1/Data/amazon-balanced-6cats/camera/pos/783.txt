Was pleased to receive the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants. I do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the KODAK P712. The Kodak P712 is a great camera and takes excellent pictures. By adding the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens to the P712, it makes already great pictures even better, and what clarity. I recommend this product to everyone!
