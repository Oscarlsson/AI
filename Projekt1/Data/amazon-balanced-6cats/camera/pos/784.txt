The picture and dimensions are incorrect.  It is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue.  The correct dimensions are 2.9"x4.2"x1.8" (WxHxD).

It also fits the Fujifilm v10 camera which I bought it for.  Amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture.  I am keeping this one, it is a perfect fit
