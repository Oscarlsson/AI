I bought this as a present for my wife.  I was looking for something that she could carry in her purse.  the automatic functions are easy and functional.  It is not an enthusiasts camera:  too hard to get into the menus.  The screen is easy to turn off(this sucks battery power).  and it even has an optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately)  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are excellent.  The drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg.  The wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary(read that as expensive if you lose it
