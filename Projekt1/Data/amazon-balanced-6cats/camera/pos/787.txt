I purchased a Nikon L5 from Costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on Saturday after I saw the LZ-7.  The LZ-7 is way better in all aspects than the Nikon L5, save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode.

PROS:  Takes great pictures; optical image stabilization; 6X zoom; and, great price.  It is also made in Japan, not China as the Nikon L5 is.

Cons:  Fixed zoom while in movie mode; no on-board camera speakers
