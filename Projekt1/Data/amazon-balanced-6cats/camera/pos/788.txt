Fall through Spring I always carry my R817 in coat pocket when I go out. This jacket fits my camera like a glove. Allows access to all controls and LCD display through clear, heavy duty plastic film, once flap is opened. Open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera. Only time I  zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery, otherwise, I just leave jacket on camera at all times.
