I bought this lens to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I absolutely love this lens.  I got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well.  With some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot.  
I read the other reviews and must say that I have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before.  And I have taken countless insect shots with this lens.  It is a bit louder than the other lenses I have but I don't see it to be a problem.  The one problem I do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower.  When this happens I just flip it to manual and focus that way.  No big deal.
Overall, great lens for an even greater price.  Definitely worth it.  (I submitted a photo of a bee that I took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.)
