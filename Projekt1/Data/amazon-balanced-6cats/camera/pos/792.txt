Upgrading to the TZ3 from a 4yr old Canon 3.2 megapixel. Waited a few months to purchase when I heard the TZ1 was being updated. With the TZ3, Panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the TZ1 which were: No build in lens cover, noisy images at higher ISO speeds. IMO, the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the TZ1. 

As others have said, this camera has a great build quality, easy operation, and a high-quality look. I ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. It has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera, which is cool. The chrome (or polished stainless steel, cant tell), is first rate and looks great with the matte black case. The LCD is huge and bright. The camera's "Simple Mode" does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable. The zoom is fantastic, but you need a really steady hand at full zoom, even with Optical Stabilization turned on. I did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as I came across a herd of deer. Shot to shot speed is really great, unless you are using the flash. The red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera I have used. Overall, I am extremely pleased. If you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor, you should seriously consider the DMC-TZ3
