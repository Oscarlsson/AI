I shot my second feature (Flying Tiger) on the DVX and took it to the Cannes Film Fest market and no one could tell it wasn't film.  This camera is fantastic if you shoot right.  I suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models.  We have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite.  The JVC is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas, true, but for the money, the DVX, if you shoot properly with it, will get you amazing results.  

For proof, you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site.  

We had the best luck in natural light, with simple chimera diffusers.  If you're honest with yourself and don't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon (getting a real distribution deal/full 35mm blowup) and you need a good looking film for fests or DVD, there is no way you should shoot on film, or another camera.  We shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers, all because of the look this camera gave us.  I'm planning on using it again for my next film.  !Viva la revolucion!  Put the DVX in 24p Advanced mode and rip the knob off
