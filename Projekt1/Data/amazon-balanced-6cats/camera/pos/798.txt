When I first opened up the "Super Quick Charger" I was a bit put off... it's small, it's cheap looking... compared to the old NiCd charger I used to have it was very unimpressive. Then I plugged it in. 

Say what you will about this barebones solution, it works amazingly well. It charges the batteries quickly and the batteries last a really long time in between charges. It does exactly what I was looking for. 

If I could improve anything it would be to implement some sort of cover on the battery slots. While it's not essential to the process by any means, it would look a lot better, and the batteries would be less prone to being jostled out of their positions in mid-charge by a curious cat.
