I love this battery charger!  I used to use store bought AA batteries for my Olympus digital camera, but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week, the batteries were drained of power.  For some reason, this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if I am just storing my camera.  Highly recommended
