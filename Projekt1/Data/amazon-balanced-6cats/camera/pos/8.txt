The controls are a little complicated to get used to, especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable.  After I bought it, I took the D10 to Budapest, Hungary.  I had a great view of the Danube and set my camera up for night shots.  It did a brilliant job.  How about this:  take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible), use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through Shutterfly.com. Image remained amazingly sharp. Colors were fantastic.  The camera made it easy to look like a pro. The only gripe I have with this camera is that I wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive Canon digitals, but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue.  The price is great, it has a magnesium body (vs. the Rebel's plastic body).  You get a lot of the D1/D20/D30, without the cost
