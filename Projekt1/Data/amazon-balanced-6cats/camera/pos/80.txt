I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static "Warhammer models" with my 10D.  I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were "too long" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot.

The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose.  Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting.

As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in "startled" subjects and missed shots.

The same also applies for non-macro shots as well.  Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well
