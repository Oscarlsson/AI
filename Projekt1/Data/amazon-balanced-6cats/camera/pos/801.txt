I own the stylus 710 that I have had since september of last year, and love it to pieces.  Little did I know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later.  It has all of the features and software of the 710 model, with digital image stabilization, but 
5x optical/5.6x digital/28x total zoom , an upgrade from 15x total zoom (3x optical and 5x digital).  The price is about the same, and actually an excellent deal here on amazon. The 2.5" color LCD monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810, and the 1000 series, and I have not problem with it, I think it is comparable to all models in this range (panasonic, fuji, kodac, hp).  I the bright sun, no LCD is going to be really great. I have captured many fun moments with this camera (2 weddings, 2 vacations) and love it. The diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense, but that is well worth the sacrifice, because having more optical zoom = better picture.  I know, I tested this side by side with my 710.  Pick this up, you will not be dissapointed. Also, look at the 750 and the 760 models, both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization, but alter the zooms a bit.  Compare, and see what meets your needs. 

Also, the Olympus Mastersoftware is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand. Both ways, this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time.
