I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.  It is a great investment for anyone that doesn't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos
