Looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads "Panasonic", not "Lumix". Fits the camera perfectly. No extra room for memory cards, spare battery, charger, etc. It's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down. The belt loop won't fit most belts. No straps. However, the camera's strap is good enough. Good protection
