I just got this camera recently along with the printer. Setting up was very simple. The only problem I came across was putting the ribbon in the printer. You have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it's not that easy. When you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon. It takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer. The pictures come out very nice and print even better. I washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless. This camera is a value and shouldn't be passed up. The screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too. If you have any further questions feel free to comment them and I'll reply as possible
