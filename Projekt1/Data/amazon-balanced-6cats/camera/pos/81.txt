This is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier Canon Digital Elph that I lost several years ago. The 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures. In fact the digital zoom also works great - just make sure the camera is steady (I purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome). Although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have, you can't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes. The Canon SD500 is a great little camera
