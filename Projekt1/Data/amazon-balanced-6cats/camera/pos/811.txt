 I bought this sweet little thing because I am planning a day in NYC and don't want to bring along my regular camera, which is bulky. This camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket. It has 5 MP and a 3X optical zoom which is great for the price. The pictures I took outside turned out outstanding. Inside pics were a bit pixelated, but I may have had the settings wrong. The camera is easy to use right out of the box.

Perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case
