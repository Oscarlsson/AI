I have received this camera for serveral weeks. It's a good long zoom digital camera. I can use it for 18x optical zoom when I set its photo size less than 3M EZ. the photo isn't blur as I use image stabilized. The picture is sharp. Image quality is good. However I have to set the ISO at 100 or 200. When the ISO is 400 or above, I can see the noise, and the picture lose detail. But every camera has its own defect. Overall, I am satified with this camera, and I am enjoying using it to take pictures.
