I bought this camera six months ago for my 12 year old daughter.  It was her (and ours) first digital camera.  I read so many reviews prior to selecting this model.  The reviews for this camera were so helpful.  This camera has been so easy to use and it takes excellent pictures.  Rechargeable batteries are definitely a must! This camera is the best camera for this price, no doubt about it.  We have taken still shots and videos.  It is so fun to have the option to take a video.  We have some great clips.  All I can say is we are so happy with the camera.  We would definitely choose it again
