This camera is an exelent camara. It has plenty of effects, plenty of modes, plenty of scenery options. The image quality is 3.2 megapixel, but its quite good. The pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury, where as if you take it with the flash, it comes out exelent. And sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash, and sometimes it happens imediatly. But all these flaws are only with my version.

But if you are looking for a good camera with a great price, this is your best option
