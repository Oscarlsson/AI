I purchase this lens for the Digital Rebel XT body I also purchased through Amazon.  So far the lens has performed as expected.  It is solid and well built.  Sticks slightly, when zooming through 200mm.  Images are crisp and focus is sharp.  Working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod.  Shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick. 
Overall, good lens for  $200.  If you have more money, then a lens with Image Stabilization (IS) would be the way to go.
