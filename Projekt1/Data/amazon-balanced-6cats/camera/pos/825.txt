This is a great product. I wish I had not waited so long to purchase it. You must be aware that it only works with L type batteries. I though that it would work with P or M types, which is what I have for 2 Sony camcorders. I had to then purchase an L battery (NP-F970). My old camcorder that uses P batteries is able to charge L batteries as well. Do your homework with the batteries
