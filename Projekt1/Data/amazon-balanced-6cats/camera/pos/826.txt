My Sony FX1 has great low light capability, 3 lux, but eventually you WILL need extra light. Using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess, no matter which camera you use.

I'm so glad I bought it.  Used it for my birthday party. Though the overhead light was good, dark corners of the room require more light. If you consider yourself advanced, semi-pro, or a pro videographer, you MUST HAVE a light.

My only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts. No variable for 5, or 15.  It is worth getting a long life battery like the NP-970. Independent power source (battery) is a plus. But no outlet plug adaptor that I know of
