I purchased an off brand to use with my FXF-10 when this case was on back order.  It was terrrible, so I ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased.  The camera fits perfectly into the case and, although it is described as a "soft case," it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk
