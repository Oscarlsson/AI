This lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it, the fact is the FZ7 and the FZ30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it.  If I can I'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens. The camera I have is a FZ7.  Because I want as large an image as possible of my focus I am very happy
