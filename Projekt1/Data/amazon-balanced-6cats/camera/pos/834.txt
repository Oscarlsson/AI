I have sticked with Sony since I got my first digital camera 4 years ago and Sony camera has been the moneys worth! This one DSC-T10 is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change. It fits in my purse and still have space for more, the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery(for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere) you need that one when you don't thing you need an extra battery, you always run out at the wrong time.
I recommend this one
