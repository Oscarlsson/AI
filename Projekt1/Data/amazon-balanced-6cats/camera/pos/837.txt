This case is great for the quick day outings.  It is rugged and keeps the camera safe.  My wife can throw it in her purse and I don't have to worry about it getting banged up and she doesn't have to worry about it being too bulky.  Everyone should have two batteries with any of the Canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead.
