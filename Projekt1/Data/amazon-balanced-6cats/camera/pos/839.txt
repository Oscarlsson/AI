Due to a canoe accident on vacation, mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds. But - only a trickle of water got inside. Once that dried out, much to my surprise, both the AF and VR functions worked fine. All that's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens (Okavango Delta water is clean!).

Don't try this at home. Next time I'm even near a canoe, I'll have everything in dry bags.
