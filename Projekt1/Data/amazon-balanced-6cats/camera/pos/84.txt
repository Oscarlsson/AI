I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption.

I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep).

Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)
