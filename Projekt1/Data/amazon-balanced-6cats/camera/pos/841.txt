I would like to add to the reviews already posted, especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 VR.  This is one of the only times I can remember when I have had the money to buy a Nikon lens, but have not been able to bring myself to do it.  The 80-400 is 6 years old, uses ancient mechanical (slow) focus, and has yet to be updated with VRII technology.  All that, and it still costs more than the pro-quality Canon 100-400 IS, which has Canon's AF-S equivalent too!  That said, I like long yet portable lenses, and after giving myself fits decided to "settle" for the 70-300 because it has VRII and AF-S.  If you are in the same boat then buy this lens, it is a gem for its intended purpose.  I get sharp results wide open at 300, and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures.  I would have LOVED this lens if it was an f/3.5, but even at 4.5-5.6 I have really been surprised at the results.  Save the $1000+ until Nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur
