This digital camera is awesome. I have no problem with the batteries.  I made sure I put the good batteries in (no cheap ones).  I looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price.  I purchased this camera with the 1GB card with it.  I can't wait to start using it when I go to San Diego in March.....  Awesome digital camera......  You won't be sorry on this purchase...
