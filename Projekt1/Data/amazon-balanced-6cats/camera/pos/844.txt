This is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball, as far as I can tell. If you follow the directions, and are as close to the action as possible, and at a "straight on" angle, it looks like its correct in the + - 1 mph statement. However, this is a cool gadget, but if you are serious about "speed" and would like more versatility, then your going to have to go with the official MLB JUGS gun...but at a much higher price.

good luck
