Bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting. Easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights, with the crank, make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope, no matter how tall they are. Compact and lite to carry, makes it easy to transport to and from the range
