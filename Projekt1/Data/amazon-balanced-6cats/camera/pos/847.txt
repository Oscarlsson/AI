I bought this camera to replace a high MP Sony pocket camera, and I am thrilled with it.  The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous in any lighting.  The red eye reduction really works, and gets rid of the red-eye before it ever gets to the memory card.  It has a compact flash card memory system, which is great because big compact flash cards are much more afforadable than the other types of cards.  This camera is better than my brother's Canon SLR in terms of picture quality, but not nearly as bulky and cumbersome.  The battery life is fantastic.  One other nice feature is the screen at the top of the camera which lets you see how many pictures you have, and the batter life, mode, etc without opening the screen.  The only drawbacks to this camera are (1) not the biggest zoom lens, but plenty enough for the typical photographer, (2) the screen could be bigger, but still acceptable, and (3) when you have the screen open, you can't use the viewfinder, which is a little annoying, but not a big deal.  I have owned 4 other high-end digital cameras and this is by far the best one I have ever used.
