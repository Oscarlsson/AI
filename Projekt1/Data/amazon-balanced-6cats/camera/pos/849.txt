For the price, you get a lot out of this camera. 6X zoom Stabilized,  the images comes out great at full zoom (2 stabilization mode).  The aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture.  The multiple program modes, just about lets you take a great picture under different situation! Controls are easy to use and get to. In all definitely a great buy for the price.  The down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the DMC-LZ5 or a camcorder.
