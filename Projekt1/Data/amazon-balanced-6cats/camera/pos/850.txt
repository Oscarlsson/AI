Easy to learn, takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you DO need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't that great. Very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash, though, and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots, even though it touts a "sports" mode). It's a good beginner's camera, a good pocket-style camera, but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit.
