set the diffusion to 'stun' when you don't want your flash to 'kill' with harsh, sharp, shadowy edges. yes, you need this if you have an sb-600. why? nikon doesn't make a diffuser for that model. basically, it fits snugly on the tip of the flash, slides off and on easy, will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks, like that macro shot of the benihana chefs. here's what it does: diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments. simple, Sherlock. the omni-bounce (what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic) performs as expected, no real cons, except shipping adds almost 50% to the price, so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering
