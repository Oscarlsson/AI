This diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the Nikon SB 800 flash.  It is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro.  This is made to fit the SB 600 perfectly.  It snaps on and off easily.  Angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill. I use it on the SB 600 set up as a slave with the SB 800 for fill and back lighting.  It should have been included by Nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective.  Much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser
