We love this camcorder!  We bought it because our other bulky, digital video that uses tapes, which we would have to copy onto VHS/DVD, stopped working.  We didn't want to spend a lot of money.  We loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it (which is very simple to do, and you do not have to download any software.)  I have to admit I was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great, and only 60 minutes concerned me, but the pictures is great and I haven't ran out of time yet.  We have used this indoors, outdoors and have no problems.  We have recorded our son's basketball games and it worked great.  We read where the batteries didn't last very long, but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have.  This is a must for those who have children or grandchildren
