I really enjoy my Photosmart R725.  It's small, easy portable, takes wonderful photos, and is very versatile in terms of settings.  I just have one thing I don't like about it, and that's the fact that there is no viewfinder.  There is an LCD screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder, but it's hard to see in bright sunlight, and I'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use.  For now, it's great but I'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run.  At the same time, it's not spendy, so it might be worth it
