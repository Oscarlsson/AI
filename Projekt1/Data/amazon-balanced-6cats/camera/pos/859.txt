Outstanding camera in every respect. I've owned several digital cameras in recent years (Sony & Nikon). The N2's giant 3" LCD, the touch screen features, lens optics, and overall ease of use top any of my previous cameras. I use it for both land and underwater photography and it performs flawlessly. Good job Sony
