I won the Kodak printer at a scrapbook convention & then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price. Purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest & beat out anything I could find in the local stores. It is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store's website, wait a few days, go there & pick it up, etc. Great value
