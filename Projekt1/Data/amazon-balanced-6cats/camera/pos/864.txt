This flash is the perfect back-up for a studio, or Main/flash fill for an amateur studio.  I use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of Dollars.  I like that they are light and easy to pack and transport.  They are reasonably priced.  They have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles.  The SUNPAK has auto/f-stop and manual.  If you are a real photographer, you will know how to use them.  The down side is that if your SUNPAK is plugged into a wall, it takes far too long to recharge (sometimes 3-5 seconds).  Rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes.
