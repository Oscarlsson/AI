I enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera.  My Minolta Dimage X (about 15% small in size than this camera) had reached the end of its useful life, having been around for about 5 years.  The Minolta had a 3/4" screen on the back.  (this one has a 2.5" screen- great colors)

The best feature I liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens.  I don't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty.  Therefore, I was excited that this camera had an internal zoom.

Tonight I was at a Bulls game, in the 300 section (nose bleed), and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of Kirk Hinrich.  The 3x optical zoom is incredible, but more so incredible is the digital zoom.  I was also able to zoom into the jumbotron, and it looked as crisp as if I was taking the photo directly. 

Action shots are GREAT. Low light shots are GREAT!  

It is exactly what I was looking for
