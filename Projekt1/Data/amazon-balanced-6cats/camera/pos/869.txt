I bought this camera around the beginning of July and have used it several times already.  I've upgrade from a Nikon Coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller, sleaker size and more megapixels.  This camera takes excellent pictures, in broad daylight as well as in the dark.  Red eye reduction is wonderful, however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times.  It's not broken... it's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch.  Overall, I think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation!
