It was time to upgrade my 2.0 MP Canon PowerShot S200 which is more than three years old (ancient in a digital world) to a camera which takes higher quality pictures. The newer Canon cameras had a larger screen, but it was basically the same camera. After a month, I am still pleased that I purchased the Nikon CoolPix S6:

+ push button to switch between camera versus play modes (versus a toggle slide which is hard on the nails)
+ easy-to-navigate mode and menu options with flywheel like an iPod
+ no telescopic lens = no annoying zoom sound during focus, on/off, less wear-and-tear on the most vulnerable component
