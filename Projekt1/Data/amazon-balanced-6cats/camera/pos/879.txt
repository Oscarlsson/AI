I love this camcorder. It is very easy to use, the piture quality is great. You can record wide screen or full screen. Light weight, fits in the palm of your hand which is more stable and less shaky when taping. The controls are within easy reach while taping. It is so easy to use that both of my kids have even been using it and they are only 9 and 6. It is also a great price. Can't wait for all our summer vacations to start taping. 

I bought this camcorder two weeks ago from best buy. I just wrote my review and then read the others and I had to add this in, there were comments being made that you can hear the tape while recording and then in the play back. I slightly hear the noise when I am taping, but I cannot hear it when I am playing it on my dvd player. To hear the noise while taping you have to have it right next to your ear. But not noticable on the playback on computer or through the dvd player
