I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.
