  I am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit. I bought the Canon because it has facilities for an external mike. I am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another. First on the matter of tape drive noise: yes I can hear it if I put the unit up to my ear. But no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer. Second, they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer. What they don't tell you is that you need a Firewire card and cable (about $70.00 total at Best Buy). You cannot simply hook up through the available computer USB port. Fortunately, Microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the XP OS and minimal capture software called "Moviemaker". 

 I am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit, I think it is a bargain. Finally, I have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out. Your thumb easily controls on/off and tape transport functions. It is really easy to use, at least for right handed users. All considered, I am satisfied with the product. Of course, if it dies next week, I will have a different opinion
