I am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera. Probably below average. I started trying to use 100% Sony electronic products because my computer was a Sony and Sony-Sony linkages make for easy use. Given that, here is what I think of the product:

1. It is amazing how much camera you can get for the money. Compared to just 6 months ago, or a year ago, this is a lot of camera for the money. It is very small, fits easily in your pocket, but takes great pictures. Also, it is very easy to use and recharge. 

2. A visit to the Sony website, suggests that Sony has new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras that are very similar.  This makes it hard to compare cameras, even within the Sony brand, and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it.

3. A problem with this camera, given it is so small -- do not shake. Your pictures will be blurry. I am a typical guy, with very little fine motor control. My hands have trouble holding small objects. Holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture -- well the results are not pleasant.

4. I tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras. I guess if you really want to zoom in, then you have to go to a big camera. But it still seems like the small cameras could offer more.

5. Having said all of that, in the end, this camera is small and easy to carry, light weight, durable, and it is also easy to use. When you look at it, it looks well made. I ended up giving the camera to my in-laws, because they lost theirs. My in-laws tend to be technologically challenged. I said to them, just leave the dial set to the little green camera, and snap away. I have to say - they love this camera. 

Overall. For the money, a great purchase, technology is amazing. Just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than I have.
