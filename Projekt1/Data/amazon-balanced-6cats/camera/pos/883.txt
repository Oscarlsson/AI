This lens hood designed specificaly for the Coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory.  It does more than just protecting the lens, which it certainly does, esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid.  (Don't forget Murphy's Law.)

But the lens hood can also improve your picture quality.  As with SLR lenses, the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture.  This is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused (scattered).  Just use this all the time (see exception below) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best (all other factors being equal, of course).

The only times you should *NOT* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700, esp. indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source.  The hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject.  Even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light, you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure.
