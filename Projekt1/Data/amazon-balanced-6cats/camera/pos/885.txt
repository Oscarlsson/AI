We bought this camera because our other digital camera (SONY DSC-H1) was too large to carry around a lot of the time. We took it skiing with us (Whistler, BC) and it took some outstanding pictures, both of persons and of landscape/scenery. It is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere, anytime. Others may disagree, but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive. Fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed (or better yet, use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers, that doesn't leave any marks on the screen). To summarize: this is an excellent camera, very small size but with a large 3" LED display, takes EXCELLENT pictures, and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive. Most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it. The only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder, but unless you have very bright sun at your back this isn't too much of a problem.
