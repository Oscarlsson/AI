This is a camera that is very very easy to use. I was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light. I took a movie at my nephew's theater play and I am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect. The zoom is also very clear and crisp. Putting it onto my iMovie was also a piece of cake. 
The only down point is that the still image mode is worthless, but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot.
I highly recommend this camer
