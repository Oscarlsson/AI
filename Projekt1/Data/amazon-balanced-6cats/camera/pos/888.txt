I bought this for my mother...she loves it! Its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view.  The print quality is excellent.  I got more (merchandise and quality) with this HP brand than I would had with any other brand.  The price was excellent too.  Good job Hewlett Packard for making me a "smart" person
