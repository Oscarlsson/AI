This lens has gotten some bad reviews, I think, partly because it is starting to show it's age.  This was the first USM IS lens, and the technology has REALLY grown since then.  If Canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 USM IS lens, man, it would blow everything away.  

That being said, yes, this lens IS a little slow to focus.  But, if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games, you should be okay.  It also could use an extra stop (or two, or three!) because when you are handholding, you need that aperture to be as open as it can be. 

All of this aside, I really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens.  It lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for.  If you have asteady hand and plently of availible light, you can get some really nice shots.  If you are in a low light situation... you will need a tripod.  The IS of lens works... pretty good, but I have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that wouldn't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with. 

All in all, its a good starter telephoto lens, especially for digital SLRS since it really extends the zoom on those.  Its great for the price, and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon L beauties, just sell it
