I have had several digital cameras and this tops them all!!!!  Everything they say about it, is true.  I love not even having to think about batteries, I didn't believe what people said about the battery life, and I was just happy I didn't need to think about batteries, but I just got married and my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures with this camera and her pictures are almost as good as the photographer I hired and yes the camera battery lasted all day and thru the next 4 days on our honeymoon with another 200 pictures taken, no low battery light!!!!!  I even going to buy my parents one.  Also, one more note I love how fast you can take pictures, no wait 4 seconds between shots.  I had a Kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old and hated it, I hated the download procedure, it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive, but in it's own little cubbyhole and trying to attach them to your email was absolutely a nightmare, you'd have to identify the picture copy it to your desktop, remember what you called it and then attach it your email.  This is the main reason why I purchased this camera.  I will never own anything else, especially a Kodak.
