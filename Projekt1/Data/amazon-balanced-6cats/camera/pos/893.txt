I bough this waterproof case for a trip to St. Thomas over Christmas.
The photographs that we took came out perfect.  The flash diffuser worked well, by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras.  Make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance.  
The only problem that I had was since it is so compact, I often accidently would move the switch to movie mode.  This ruined a few photographs, but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air. 
I know that it was expensive, but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having X-ray machines fog up the pictures
