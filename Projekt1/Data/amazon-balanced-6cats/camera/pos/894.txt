I bought this underwater housing in anticipation of a trip to the Galapagos.  It worked perfectly, and I obtained some really incredible shots, both still and video.  The combination of the Canon SD550 and this housing were amazing.  I did make sure to lubricate the primary o-ring each time I opened the housing.  But the need to do so was reduced by using a larger, 1GB memory card - both card and battery would last a little over two dives, before I need to change one or the other
