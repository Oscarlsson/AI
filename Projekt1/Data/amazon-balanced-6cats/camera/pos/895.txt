I'm a long time Canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade.  I can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera, the pictures are fuzzy.  Take a look at one of the newer Canons with image stabilization and I think you'll be happier.
