I dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and won't close. After some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place, I finally was able to close the lens. 

Besides that, it is an awesome camera. I am able to pick out a color (ex. red) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white. No photoshop needed
