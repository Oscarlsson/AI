Kodak V705 Black: Small, can carry in pocket. Wide Angle Lens,great for group photos. Fast start up time. Video mode is easy, built in mic picks up all the sounds.Camera can stitch 3 photos together-great for vistas. I am happy with this camera. Bought another  V705 in silver for my friend and she loves it.Kodak makes easy to take photos.
Weak flash- try  not to be more than 6-8 feet away-or use photoshop on photos
