I bought a spare battery for my D70s and charged it up one time. Since then, I have been waiting to use my spare but the original (charged hundreds of pictures ago) has been going strong for, literally, months.

Follow the directions. Don't use it until your fully charge and don't recharge until it's run down. This will help maintain battery life.

Good product from a great company
