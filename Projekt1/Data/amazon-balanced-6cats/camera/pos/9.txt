This is one of the four cameras, the only digital camera, I used to learn portrait photography.  The class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera. I wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because I wanted an SLR film camera also.  I got the Canon Rebel Ti packed with two lenses. It made sense to me to purchase a Canon digital to interchange lenses. My original choice was the Canon Digital Rebel, however, in my  WEB search, I found the EOS 10D for $750 with no catch.  There were no required additional purchases scam when I called.  This allowed me to spend the extra money I would have spent on the camera on accessories.  

Since it's digital, I am not shy about trying out the features.     When I first got the camera, some of the photos were dark or very light. After tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means I don't get that anymore. 

The 10D is more camera than I need that I'm sure I will have it for a long time.
