Pros: Compact, lightweight, portability, easy to use, big screen, good reproduction

Cons: Microphone sensitive to wind, getting used to not having a viewfinder, bad low light performance.

Summary: I picked this camera as an upgrade for my old Canon ZR10. The first reason I chose it was the small size and portability. With a good light conditions, this little beast do its best shots, but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me (specially compared with mi old ZR10). Please don't buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution. 

The included handycam station have all the ports (Firewire, USB, power, video) you need to conect it. 

The big touch screen is a must, because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls (besides some of them in the edge of the screen). 

You can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price, but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini DV format
