I purchased this camera to use with my previous church's media ministry, based on my trial use of the VX2000.  That was three years ago.  This camera is STILL running as well as it did when I bought it. I use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and DVD production, plus, I get great digital audio recordings when I plug directly into my current church's sound system.  The ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible.  Now that I am creating a multimedia team for our church, I've convinced the church to buy one for themselves
