Reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools.  An imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer.  I am not a master, but I do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are.  When you use ISO settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise.  I think it is a great little camera and I have used it a lot on my latest photo project.  Keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size.  This also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability.  There is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it.
