The Nikon S3 has proven to be a good buy.  It is affordable yet takes a quality photo.  In addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket.  This camera has the ranging ability to take both a simple aim and shoot photo, and at the same time complex skill shots that is complemented by computer editing and redeye reduction.  My only complaint is as a result of the user.  If the camera does not have time to focus, then the picture quality suffers immensely. This camera has only been in use for about two months but has not let me down yet!
My rating: 9/10
