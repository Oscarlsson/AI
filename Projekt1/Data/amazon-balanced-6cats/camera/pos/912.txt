This is my first digital picture frame, so I do not have anything to compare it against.  I am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use, and I am happy with the resolution and the picture quality. 

The only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all, and as one other reviewer noted, I had to learn how to do things by trial and error.  I also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images, it is not "saved" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time.  

However, I like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next Christmas
