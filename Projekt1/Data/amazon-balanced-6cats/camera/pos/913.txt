My husband is away (military) and I was looking for the perfect, small but clear, pictures for him.  I didn't care about the frame, only the small white digital system.  I was hesitant, as my MIL has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible.  I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an SD card and transferring pictures from the computer.  I love that I can use either batteries or the included plug.  Everything was soooo easy that I did not even need to read the instructions to begin.  I also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later.  This is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable.  Perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are!  Then, when he comes home, it's great for a portable album to carry anywhere
