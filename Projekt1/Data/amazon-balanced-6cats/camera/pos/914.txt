Good product, like the price.  This is much less expensive than the current pinseeker 1500 models, I bought it on ebay used for $150 so you may be able to find it for less (look under hunting AND golf rangefinders for this model).  This does not have the pinseeker feature of the newer models but normal mode and scan mode work perfectly for ranging flags that have no reflectors (although you may need to try more than one time and have relatively stable hands).  I was able to range a flag at 270 yards, and was able to range the top of a telephone pole at 375 yards (but it was windy so the flag was straight out and a little cloudy).  I would estimate that this will work for ranging flags on a calm sunny day (these don't work as well on a sunny day because the laser used is a visible light laser and gets a little interference from sunlight) at 215-230 yards for a flag (which is what I need it for).  Less expensive alternative than the pinseeker, and I really like the performance, very impressed.
