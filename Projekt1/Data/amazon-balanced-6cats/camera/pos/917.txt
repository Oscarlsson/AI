I bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because I knew that if she was going to try digital photography, it had to be EASY ! The printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends.   I have used the older CX-7300,( very similar camera) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions. The lack of optical zoom is a plus for me; less to break. The C530 is more compact, has better resolution, and still has the option of using AA batteries when the rechargables die. If you want simple digital snapshots, you will love this little camera
