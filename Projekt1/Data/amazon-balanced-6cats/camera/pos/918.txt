For an all-purpose color film, I nearly always shoot Fuji's 200 speed.  It has the cooler tones that I prefer in my images and a good saturation level.  The only drawback that I've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over-priced!  The only place that I've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets.  Any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less, and you won't have to wait for it to ship
