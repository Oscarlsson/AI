The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility.
The stabilization aspect is a great help, although it doesn't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions.
Highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the Canon Rebel XT
