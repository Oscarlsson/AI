This is a pretty good camera, loaded with lots of features.  The pros include the 10x optical zoom, use of SD card, and battery consumption.  Also, with this camera you have the ability to buy add-ons such as zoom lenses and such - makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience.

There are a couple of cons that I've found, the most important being the picture quality.  Although it does have the capability to take great photos, you have to make sure and wait several seconds between shots to ensure that they'll come out looking great (in my opinion, anyway).  The size is okay, although it is kinda bulky for being so small.  I prefer something that size to also be slim - it's not so easy to carry around because of this.

Overall, this camera is very easy to use
