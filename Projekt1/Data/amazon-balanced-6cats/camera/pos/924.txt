Have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities. Do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens; for the price it is a nice lens.  I tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor's roof using 200 mm telephoto.  When you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name!  Without the image stabilizer, it is a blur.  I did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting. Without image stabilizer the title is blurred; with the image stabilizer it is sharp. A very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save, or use filters to make them BW, soft, more bright, or with different color tones.  

People report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash.  This is true.  However, you can use the P mode, which is like an auto mode, reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice!.  Great low light capabilities with image stabilizer.

If you are into action photography, this may not be the camera for you.  It has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay.  Other camers react faster and have larger capacity.  

Do reset default from bright to natural tone.  You can do this in some modes, but not all.  Read the manual, it really will empower you with many nice capabilities.  Newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically
