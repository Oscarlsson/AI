I'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera, the Aiptek Zoom DV-6 MP Image Stabilizing Camcorder w/3x Optical Zoom.  I see the claim that it has 3x OPTICAL zoom and cannot help but question this because I am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since July 30th, 2006.  Am wondering what gives with that?  

Please someone, post a review of this model and hopefully, some picture results too.  Let us know about this 3x optical zoom, please!    

I had to pick a rating, so the four star rating was based on the MPVR version of this camera -- which I own and find to be a very decent gadget.  Mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model.  MP3's sound terrific.  I convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and... "wow" for its quality.  I have recorded sounds and more.  Very decent!  Just drag and drop my files from my PC to the SD card and I can switch out movies and MP3's.  I am happy with that model, but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital.  Still get pretty good pix tho, just use the various settings...  My little homemade movies are good, very decent, but without additional lighting, indoor movies will be dark.  This camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - I use an umbrella over my cam as I film.  Big diff.  

So, is this newer model really all that much better?  Can't wait to know!  3x optical sounds good..
