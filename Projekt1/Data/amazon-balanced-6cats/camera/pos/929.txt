After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth. Bottom line: no complaints with it
