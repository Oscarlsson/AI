I bought a Canon Powershot A70. They say your best camera is the one you use most, and man I use it. I'm a high schooler, so I dont have much money, but with the A70, I can attach this adapter (LA-DC52C) to my camera, and I can have more photographic freedom with lenses, for alot less money. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ADAPTER FIRST. Then any lense which fits (most), can be used... GOOD IDEA CANON!!!
