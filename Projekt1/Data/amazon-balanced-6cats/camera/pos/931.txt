I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received
