yes this is a very good first camcorder. i am a first time user of any cam corder. 

i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting. 

but the software is harder to use that movie maker.

but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20GB is engough to use..

but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film!!!

it is just fantastic.

enjoy..
