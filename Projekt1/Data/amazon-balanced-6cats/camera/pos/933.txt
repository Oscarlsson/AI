Well, this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots, but if you don't have good lighting, you end up with pictures that are worthless.  I suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the DX6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless.  Best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash.  Plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures.  Also remember that because you can't use the flash option, you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots.  Otherwise, this lens is excellent.  It fits easily into my camera bag, is simple to attach (with the lens converter of course) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect.  Other than the inability to use my flash with the lens, I think it is great
