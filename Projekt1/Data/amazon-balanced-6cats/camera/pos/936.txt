This cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you can't say which company it belongs to. I have used a lot of sony products and I feel it is not up to the standard of sony. 
It works great had no problems so far. It is flexible kinds so you don't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your TV.
