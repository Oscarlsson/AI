So far, I really love this camera.  It's very user friendly and gives you the option to put it in a VERY BASIC mode or normal mode.  What attracted me to purchasing this camera was because of the long battery life and because of the picture quality.  It has a large viewing area which is nice and it's very clear.  I recommend this camera
