I've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best I think, I shots very quick, flash is brighty, and even soft flash for more natural shots.

can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera, is light tiny and slim.

one of the best cameras.

I don't find a negative feature on it.  I love it
