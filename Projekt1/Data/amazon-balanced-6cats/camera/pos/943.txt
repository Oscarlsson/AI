I've had this digital camera for almost a year. It's the fourth camera I've owned. I spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that I could carry everywhere. Being an amateur photographer (and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others), I didn't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera. It fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse (for formal nights out). The size and weight of this camera is its best feature, and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera, too. 

This has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery. My pictures have always turned out beautifully, with wonderful color and crispness. I have discovered that the "automatic" lighting feature is not always the most ideal, but you can re-program just about anything on this camera.  

It's really quite a good camera, and given its price these days with the newer generations out there, it's a steal
