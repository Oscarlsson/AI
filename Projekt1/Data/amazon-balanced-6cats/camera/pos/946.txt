I don't think anybody is going to pretend that the little Casio Exilim EX-Z600 6.0 mega pixel camera is the best camera ever built or takes the best pictures in the world.  But for under $[...], it's hard to beat and does everything advertised.

The size is perfect, one of the smallest, slimmest cameras made, easily fitting into one's [...] pocket, even when enclosed in a small case.  The viewing screen is probably the biggest and brightest you'll find, so aiming and shooting is easy as it can be.  The range of modifications (size, contrast, sharpness, saturation, etc.) to taking and managing pictures seems almost endless, yet the various menus the camera offers are simple to navigate.  And the camera's docking stand makes downloading pictures to one's computer as well as charging up the camera a snap.  Moreover, according to Casio, a single charge will afford one up to 500 or more snaps.

Picture quality?  It's perhaps not as absolutely clear and well defined, even at its maximum six mega pixels, as the best cameras; although, to be fair, the best cameras often cost three-to-four times as much as this one.  So, as far as I'm concerned, I've no complaints, and the pictures I've been taking are a delight to the eye.  The Z600 makes picture-taking fun again
