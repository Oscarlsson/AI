This camera case is great.  It's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly.  There is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries (but the batteries make it tight).  I originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600, but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you aren't careful.  This camera case does not come with a strap like the other, but that is something I would never use.  I highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera.
