This camera was a great investment. the photos turn out wonderfully. better than a regular film camera and I have kept an eye out on simular cameras...price wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price. the only problem I have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but I think all digital cameras have that problem. this is a  great camera
