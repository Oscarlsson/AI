I bought this camera just before a trip to CA and then a cruise!  It is very easy to operate (even for a techno-retard like me) and the pictures turned out great!  I have started to use the filming feature recently as my Video Recorder is with my son @ college and I want to film my daughter's Drill Team performances!  I really like the fact that it doesn't turn on while in my purse!!!  My old camera did that a couple of times, and I ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse - anyone want one? (LOL) All in all, a great buy!  8 months later and the LCD display is gone!  Literally, GONE!  Don't know what happened - took pictures/movies of daughter's drill team performance, and when I got it out again to take pictures before Sadie Hawkins, it would still take pictures (I just downloaded them) but since the display looks like "a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side" I don't know what I'm taking a picture of!  Need to replace soon!  I'm (now) bummed
