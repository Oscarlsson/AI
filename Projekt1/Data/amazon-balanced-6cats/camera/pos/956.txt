Celestron's tool is easy to carry, easy to use, and (at least in my case!) gives me quick, precision collimation with my Newtonian.  Why pay for a laser collimator (which needs to be calibrated) when you can use this?

Collimation is the most important part of your setup; without good mirror alignment, all you'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights.  This combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless, and also fairly fast.  Highly recommended for any level of observer
