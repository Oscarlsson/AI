Very good camera. This was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera. She picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit. Directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger. Takes some getting used to. Zoom lense works great and takes good pictures. Where the on-off button is so close to the shutter, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally shut the camera off. She is very satisfied with it.
