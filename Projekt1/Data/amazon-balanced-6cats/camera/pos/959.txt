I'm pleased with the purchase. I bought this camera just under two years ago when I was getting ready for a trip abroad.

I spent six months in England, with five weeks travelling around Europe with this camera in its case on my belt. It's very sturdy if nothing else, between the trains, planes, hostels, and general bustle I'm very pleased with how well it held up. Nothing on it broke.

I probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip, if not more. Sure I've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years I've had it, but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well.

The zoom on this camera is very nice. It's one of the better zooms I've seen on a simple camera of this type, or at least it was back when I bought it.

It also has several features that older film cameras do not, such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture, or settings to take "Portraits" or "Night shots."

I know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras, I know that it doesn't have all the frills of the new digital cameras, and I am not trying to compare it to those. I'm not a professional photographer, so I don't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot. I don't want a digital for personal and professional reasons. For a traditional film camera, this one is the best I've ever used.

BOTTOM LINE: Good quality photos, a sturdy build, excellent zoom lens, useful and easy to use features, and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks
