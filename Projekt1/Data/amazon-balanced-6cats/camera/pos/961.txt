After setting booby traps for Zombies, I like to whip out my Bushnell Waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in.  This scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof.  It is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail!!
