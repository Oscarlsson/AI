Proving that there's life in the old dog yet, Bushnell have come up with this, the successor to the out-dated, poor-performing Trophy Splashproof Spotting Scope, and I have to say, it's a fantastic improvement. As soon as I took it out of the box I was impressed with its styling, shape, colour, and of course, waterproofness. I set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going, and they were oblivious to my surveillance. It's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you're laughing. Any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing, as water really does roll off it like, erm, water off a duck's back. Stunning
