This adapter is the only one available for the HD1 and while it does a good job of protecting the 1st lense with whichever 49 mm one you attach, there is a problem when you use the flash for pictures of things within 10 feet. There will be a dark semicircle on the bottom of your pictures where the flash was blocked by the adapter. I've gotten around this by using the adapter with attached lens and lens cap and having that attached to the string on the camera. whenever I need to take a picture with the flash of something up close (within 10 feet) I pop off the whole setup and take the picture as if the entire piece was a giant lens cap for the regular camera. Hope that helps
