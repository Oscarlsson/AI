I liked this lens. I used it, for the first time, while traveling through Peru. It was light-weight and easy to use. At 200mm, most of my pictures turned out great, especially when I was on steady ground (taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge!). I've printed some 8x10's of close-ups I took using this lens and I was quite impressed with the quality. It was also in my price range. Overall, I'd say it was a "good bang for the buck.
