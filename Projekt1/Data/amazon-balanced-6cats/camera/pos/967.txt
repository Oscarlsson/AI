I enjoy all the features of this item.

The main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure. You can open it without worrying about your camera falling off.

The back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear. The slot for memory cards 1-4 (depends on the card type), batteries (roomy for four AA), and cables can fit in it.

The shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy. It's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good. The belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width.

It can even handle the worst environment ever. Hot, dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops. It has protected my dig. camera very well
