After springing for the Cybershot in August so I could have a compact camera I would actually TAKE places, I've been very, very pleased. 

The last camera I had was an older Sony DSC that was quite bulky, ran on batteries, and had shutter problems--but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect, so I thought I would go for the DSCT5, since it avoids ALL of those problems. Only a tiny battery to charge, no sticky shutter... and it's sexy as hell. The screen is huge and very bright. 

I hate taking pictures with flash in general, and I find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera. (And the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything) However! You can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments. They come out surprisingly well and blur-free
