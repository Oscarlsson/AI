I deal in major brand cameras and Panasonic cameras are my personal favorite! I've seen people whine about the "noise" they make many times but have never found it to be a problem. I own the FZ10 and the FX01 for my personal cameras. The FX01 is a very fast camera and takes great pics! I love the 28mm wide lens. Compared to most cameras I've used the FX01 does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images. 

I love Panasonic's solid build and reliability. They may not be as popular as Canon or Sony but in my opinion are every bit as good.
