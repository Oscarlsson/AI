The Casio Exilim EX-S770RD is a great camera for the price.  Camera is the smallest on the market and will fit in any pocket.  LCD Sreen is large and very clear.  7.2 MP produces great picture quality and the functions are easily accessed.  As this is my first Casio purchase, I am very pleased with the quality
