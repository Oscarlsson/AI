I have own this camcorder for 6 month
it's a good camcorder, esay to use, easy to bring
As it's design purpose, PC-55 is enough for home use
Only one thing I want to mention here, before I buy this camcorder, I thought that I can record video on MS duo in mepg format, and it's easy for post-edit on PC, you know, tansfer a MiniDV tape to computer may need a huge space to save.
However, when I replay the video which stored on MS, the sreen was full of mosaic
fortunately, when use DV type to record, this situation never happens. good quality.
The one press photo button also becomes useless because the bad quality
