Great camera . . . one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack,  but beware . .. . this camera does NOT come with a lens cap, and NO remote control.  other sources state that this camera does NOT have a Leica lens.  This camera does NOT have A/V input.  No flash, no hot accessory shoe (though it has one which has no power).  No widescreen LCD.  It does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen.
