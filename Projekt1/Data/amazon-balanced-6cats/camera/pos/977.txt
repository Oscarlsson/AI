I checked the 3CCD from Panasonic and the Canon camcorders. In that price range this is the best I found (if you have the extra money, the new HDV camcorder from Sony might be your best bet!).

IMPORTANT:The CCD issues referred in other user comments are REAL (although I don't know if it will also apply to this new model). It actually happened on my previous Sony. I purchased a 5 years warranty from Sony for my DCR-HC90. 5 years is a good product life so I will take the risk of CCD failure after that period and ENJOY this GREAT product until then!

Great features are: small but feels solid, 3 megapixel pictures (impressive quality for camcorder), incredible low light performance, nice touch screen, great features. Battery life is actually not too bad from original battery but you might need an extra.

What I did not like: CANNOT take full size pictures in camera mode (only in memory mode), limited zoom compared to most new camcorders and lots of required extra (SVideo cable, ILink cable, video light, decent size memory stick, extended warranty). I am still giving this a 5-stars overall.
