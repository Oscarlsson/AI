The optical x6 zoom on the Canon A710 IS is already better than cameras in it s range (i.e. non SLR). However, the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size; the tele converter lens really does make a difference. 

Firstly, if there are any negatives, they are very minor; the lens and adapter are black - would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera. Erm, that's it!

The main quality of Canon is the lens, which they always do well. The clarity of this lens is very good, with very little fuzziness at the edge. It also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected. The electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment. The tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want.
