I ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did. I have a Stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade, an extra battery, and an extra picture card. There are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover. In the main compartment, a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money. (It won't fit much more than that, though.) It's compact, stylish and functional--I'm glad I bought it
