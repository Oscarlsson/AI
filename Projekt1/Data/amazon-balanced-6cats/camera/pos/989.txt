I've been waiting for this technology for years.  So when I found out JVC was planning on coming out with their 4 GB microdrive version, I had to have one.  The $1500 price tag was too much though.  Then I found out the GZ-MG50 was coming out, and would be about a $1000.  I thought it was still a little pricey, but I couldn't wait any longer.

So far, the camera has performed great.  It's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to DVD.  However, the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap, but it gets the job done.  Maybe the next gen version will be an improvement.

The movie quality is very good.  I won't give it a "Great" because I occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned DVDs. 

Don't bother taking pictures with this, unless you only plan on emailing them.  The quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments.

I recommend getting an additional battery (the three hour model).  The one hour battery just doesn't cut it, especially if you want to review your scenes while you're out shooting. 

If JVC gave the camcorder a larger CCD and included better software, I would have given this a 5 star rating, otherwise I think they are on the right track, and in a few years, the MiniDV may be as forgotten as the eight-track.
