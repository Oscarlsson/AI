Other than the months of waiting for Nikon to deliver them to Amazon for shipping, the battery itself in a good deal.  They work well, charge up easy and hold their charge nicely.  Priced well, they cost less than the same type battery than Canon or Sony.  I bought them for a D80 and the older En-EL3a would not fit.  Of course I had 10 of the older batteries for my D70s and was rather surprised when they didn't fit the D80.  Basically the same size and shape, but keyed differently.  I was also surprised to find the 3e WOULD fit in the D70s, meaning they are backward compatable.
