I went the (thinking it was cheaper) eBay route- for about $10 more  I got a new one here and it WORKS. eBay is nice, but when it comes to stuff like this I learned my lesson. I've never gone wrong ordering from Amazon, in fact I just ordered an OEM NB-3L battery for my SD500; tried the Radio Slop route and it won't go over 20 pictures. Again, shame on me for trying to go cheap
