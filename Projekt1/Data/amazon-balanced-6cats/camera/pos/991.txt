I have looked everywhere for this charger.  Everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that MIGHT work.  It was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera.  It's just the right size and plugs right into the wall.  The prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry-on bag.  THANKS so much for having this item available
