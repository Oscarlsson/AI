I waited a long time for Canon to come out with image-stabilized binoculars in a 100% waterproof design.  These were worth the wait.  I bought mine specifically for a cruise up Alaska's Inside Passage.  One of our sight-seeing excursions was on a 45-foot boat in heavy seas.  A fellow on this trip had a massive set of Fujinon 16x40 Gyro-Stabilized binoculars that sell for nearly $6,000.  We spent time comparing my Canon binoculars to his Fujinons.  Optically there is NO comparison.  The Canons, while not as superb optically as the best Leica binoculars, are awfully good.  They are far brighter, much sharper, and more accurate in their color rendition than the Fujinons.  The ONLY reason to spend an extra $4,500+ on the Fujinons is if you require the absolute best image stabilization that money can buy.  If you are using binoculars in very severe conditions (high seas, etc.) you will get better performance with the gyro-stabilization in the Fujinons.  In 99% of applications you will get far better results with the Canons.  Though the Fujinons are higher in their rated magnification the only time you'll see a difference is under conditions where motion is severe.  In calmer seas (not calm, just not severe) you will be better off with the Canons; the Fuji's are so much dimmer and lacking in clarity that the Canons make up the magnification difference fairly quickly.

Finally, the waterproof aspect of these binoculars really is worth having.  On the above-mentioned trip we were buffeted by rain and spray from the waves.  The Canons functioned flawlessly without a hitch, and cleaned up nicely afterwards.  These are one of the best products I've ever used, and lived up to their performance claims in every regard.

One point to note: if you want the maximum battery life it is well worth buying lithium AA batteries to use with these binoculars; this will greatly extend your battery life, particularly in cold weather
