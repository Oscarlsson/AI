i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it. first of all is's very easy to operate with the joystick, the use in the still image function is allways available, even while shooting a video (nice feature but as all camcorders - low quality pitures) the stabalizer (one of the reason why i'd preffered that cam over the other) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos. the large zoom (X32) is also very nice. overall i think this is great value for my money....
