Loved this! It is awesome because it is BOTH land and sea camera, so you need just one! You can get tons of accessories and flashes for it. It is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections INCLUDING making your photos MORE in focus in case you shot them blurry!

I cannot wait to use it again, well UNDERWATER for diving I mean
