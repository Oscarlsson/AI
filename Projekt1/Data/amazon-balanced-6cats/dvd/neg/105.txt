DENNIS LEARY IS HAILED AS SOME GREAT ANGRY YOUNG MAN WHO IS TRYING TO BRING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS. PERSONALLY I PREFER BILL HICKS. AT LEAST WHEN BILL DID IT HE WAS BEING ORIGINAL!!!!!!! DENNIS LEARY HAS IN MY OPINION NICKED BILL HICKS ACT IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW I FEEL ABOUT JOSS STONE COMPARED TO PROPER SOUL ARTISTS. SITTING IN FRONT OF A FEW LIVE VIDEOS OF A GREAT MAN AND TAKING NOTES DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL EVER BE ONE DENNIS!
DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS COVERS BANDS...STICK TO THE ACTING DENNIS
