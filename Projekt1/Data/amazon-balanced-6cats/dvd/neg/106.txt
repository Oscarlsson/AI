I was GREATLY disappointed in this DVD. Here's why:

1. It's basically 60 minutes of warming up
2. The level 3 (advanced) is not THAT HARD.
3. The annoying "inhale, exhale" chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center.' I just wanted to tell her SHUT UP
4. I didn't break a sweat once. 
5. I used it twice and never plan to use it again. I mean, c'mon, I don't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won't get me results. 

I must say the ONLY THING positive about this DVD is the landscape. 

In short, rent this from Blockbuster or buy it used. Don't waste any more than 5 bucks on this. It's not worth it.
