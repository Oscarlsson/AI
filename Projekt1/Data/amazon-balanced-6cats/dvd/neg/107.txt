There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this "movie" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is "touched" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more?
The plot, the "humor," the dialogues, and the music are way beyond "below average."
There is next to no nudity and there are no, I mean 0 as in ZERO beautiful girls, in this film!
As for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...
School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad... 
Rent or buy (ha ha ha) at your own risk.  You have been warned!
