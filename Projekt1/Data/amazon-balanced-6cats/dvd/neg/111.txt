     My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model.
