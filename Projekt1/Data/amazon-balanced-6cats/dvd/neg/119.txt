This movie has a good plot, great acting, and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life. I did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other, but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos, the profanity, the undermining of parental authority, and the lack of closure concerning Landon's journey to faith. It is evedent that this movie is directed to a less-than-mature-audience. I saw more bad in it than good, which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie
