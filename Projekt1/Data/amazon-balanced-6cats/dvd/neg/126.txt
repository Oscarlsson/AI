The reviewer who called this a Disney "bait & switch" hit the nail right on the head! I, too, remember seeing all these episodes on TV as a kid, then later on Disney Channel, and was awaiting these to be released on DVD, as I have already purchased the Davy Crockett and Tomorrowland sets and loved them both; but imagine my overt disappointment when I read the actual details of this slapped together, third rate offering!
I never cared for the Elfego Baca story, I had been known to go to my room and VOLUNTARILY do my homework on Sunday nights when these episodes played, but I would have GLADLY paid the price for this set if it had included ALL of the "Swamp Fox" episodes!
Above and beyond the fact that I am proud to have Francis Marion as a distant relative, and that I hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the Revolutionary War, who, with his compatriots, probably contributed as much as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or any of the other Founding Fathers to win us our freedom, I really loved this story just for itself!
Not only have I decided NOT to waste my money on this incomplete set, I have even gone as far as removing it from my "Wish List" to save the funds of my family and friends, as well! I shall wait to see, hopefully, if Disney will ever release the entire "Swamp Fox" story in a complete set, for which I would GLADLY pay their somewhat exorbitant price
