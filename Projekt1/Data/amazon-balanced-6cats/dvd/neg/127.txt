After watching Spirited Away I was excited to watch other movies by the same director. Unfortunately every movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic "it's bad to hate" message.
What the creators of Princess Mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive, disgusting things of the world. Yes, hate can become overly consuming, just as any other emotion can overcome us, or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one's,(just as loving that which is evil wouldn't be a good thing)  but placed in its proper context at the proper time, at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems.
And the people who claim that hate is all-evil themselves hate the "haters", which I find comical.
   The movie also has strong pro feminist/anti man messages. 
   I wanted to like this film but I don't appreciate being duped into listening to people rant and rave about nonsense
