I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.  The teenagers didn't even want to check it out after that scene.  They also loved "The RM".  If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it
