It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others.
The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.  
The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.  
Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful!
Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland.
Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on.
As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all.
Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE!
Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here.
If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man.
