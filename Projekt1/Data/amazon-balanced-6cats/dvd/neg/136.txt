I don't like her routine in this DVD at all.  I don't like the strechie.  It's a completely waste and it won't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball.  I solde the DVD the 2nd day I bought it.  However, I do like her 'Shrink Your Female Fat Zone,' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body, lower body and abs
