If you have read Harmon's acting resume online, then you know she has talent, she has the training, and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along.  But being a mild conservative (Angie is a Republican) in Liberal Hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at.  Good Advice was Bad advice for her.  It is miscast with two annoying stars; Sheen and Richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie.  It has no redeaming values at all and Angie deserves better roles then this.  This movie was made by Artiscan Films, which recently went into bankruptcy and is now Lions Gate Films, their films are still bad no matter the name change, and I still wait to see a better movie come to Angie Harmon
