I enjoy this genre of film, but found this one dull. It carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief, but fall short of both aims.  I actually groaned in response to the predictability, and shuttered at the stereotypes, which were mentioned in another review.  At best, stereotypes of ignorant, aggressively dangerous, and perpetually struggling African and Hispanic American students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable, blue eyed, blonde-haired European American belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive.  At worst, these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring.  This movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both. Further, it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial, societal, and economic issues, which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for.
