This movie was only slightly better than your basic horror cliche; the nuclear testing/mutant premise seemed promising, but all the main characters were stupid/annoying.  Seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters, the script-writers/director threw in lots of unnecessary gore.  For the most part, though, the special effects were at least well-done; however, a few of the effects were somewhat misguided.  For instance, blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red; wouldn't it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat??  Acting was mediocre.  I've never seen the original, so I cannot say whether this is better or worse.  The movie is not for the faint-of-heart simply because of the gore, but it definitely wasn't very scary.  Two stars
