I look at the average raiting for this movie. # stars, now thats supposed to mean its ok. Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get. 
Oh, and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil, just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing. I really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made. But that was untill I saw reptillian. Which is kinda depressingly awfull
