It has been a long time since I read the novel upon which this book is based, but I do clearly remember it making sense.  This movie doesn't even make sense (to quote a chicken I know).  Marlon Brando somnambulizes his way through the film and, instead of coming off as sinister, menacing, and dominating, he makes Dr. Moreau into a joke.  Val Kilmer's portrayal is vacuous and silly.  Is the character supposed to be under the influence?  I guess he wanted it portrayed that way.  The script?  Is there one?  Moreau talks about having almost reached his goal.  Where?  His one "son" and his "daughter" do have some fine traits, but both are also pretty ineffectual.

Several reviews have mentioned the special effects.  I actually saw very few special effects.  The rat-people on the boat were creepy and well-done, and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves, but mostly I saw people in very elaborate, well-done costumes, using well-distorted voices.

The central character, played by David Thewlis, should have been the focus of the movie, as he is the narrator.  He kept getting lost in the shuffle, and I kept waiting for him to see things that I saw, and to ask the questions that I would have asked.  I like him as an actor, but this is certainly not a memorably good performance.  It is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid horror here, but is the werewolf in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."

The film does create a sense of the nightmare.  Several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness, most notably Ron Perlman's preacher, but then he's well-practiced, from his "Beauty and the Beast" television series.  That was what (barely) earned this film its second star.  Let's vote them all off the island, and start over.  Robert Duvall as Moreau?  Replace Kilmer with Matt Damon?  Casey Affleck replacing David Thewlis
