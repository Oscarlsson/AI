I saw this at a friends house--so thank God I didn't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy.  I can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film!  The guys are not hot...not even lukewarm for that matter.  The acting is terrible.  Please...anyone who had anything to do with this, don't continue in the film industry.  If it was possible to assign negative stars, I would do so for this awful experience.  Run away
