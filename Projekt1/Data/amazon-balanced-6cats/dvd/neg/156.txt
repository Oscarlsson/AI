Saw this on the box last night. I sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve - it didn't. I kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film. The dialogue is wooden, the plot is pathetic, the whole set-up is unconvincing. It looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole &quot;Vegas&quot; craze - which ranges from CSI to &quot;The Cooler&quot;. (Incidentally, &quot;The Cooler&quot; is another one to avoid.)
 I would give this zero stars if I could
