I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed.

This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat.  Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying.

The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout.  I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.  

I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not.
