This could have been one of the best films of the 80's. All of the components are there. Ford gives the best acting of his career. The production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today's standards. Two things however really bring this movie down. 

The major negative here I believe is Polanski's insistence on starring Emmanuelle Seigner. This is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen grace a film, but it is the understatement of the year to say that she can't act at all. In fact, I think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance I have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys Ford's performance. When the film was over I thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here. The first half is dynamite; the second with Seigner is a totally different beast, your average stupid kid thriller. Watch this film and dare contradict my statement here. Get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part. It's so bad that  Ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in.

OK, the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up. There is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where Ford and Seigner would be time and time again. It really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot. They were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story.

I am really kind of mad with Polanski here. He destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made. And this statement comes from one who worships the ground Polanski walks on.
