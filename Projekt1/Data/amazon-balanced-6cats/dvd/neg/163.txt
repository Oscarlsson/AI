The ab portion of the DVD is good, although I fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether. The buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set. The last one is a step-type exercise so if you don't have something you can step up on, you can't do it. The DVD itself is not very professionally done. Tamilee miscounts, doesn't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words. Abs of steel maybe, buns of steel, no way
