I idiotilcy got this DVD because of Colin Firth, and, as you can see, it sucks. BTW, this is not "Prasadjonnalagadda" but rather his daughter, he just comes to buy crap, but NEVER reads the reviwes. Anyways, I had better time watching a syndicated Simpsons' episode than watching this bomb. At first, I thought that this movie might've had some potential because of the suberb stars: Colin Firth and Minnie Driver ( Good Will Hunting, Won an Oscar for it) I did not yet know Heather Grahm, but after this movie, I hate her NOW! I will admit, she was alright up until she got drunk in the car. That. Was. Annying beyond reason.

  Other than that, the film's set up is absolutly horrible, starting off with Colin coming to a town just because it's called Hope? And falling in love with someone only after a couple of days? And there is also the horrible music that doesn't fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene. Pepole, I originnaly gave this a 2 star for Colin and Minnie, but Heather is responsible for everything else.
