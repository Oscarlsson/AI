I love the History Channel, have infinite respect for the AVG, love John Wayne films, and lived two years in the part of China where Flying Tigers is set.  So, you'd think I might adore this film?  I had hoped so, but unfortunately Republic pictures made this opus on the cheap.

John Wayne plays a fictional commander of the American Volunteer Group, somewhere between Claire Chennault and Pappy Boygnton.  He does his best to carry the film, and does OK, but he can't carry it alone.  Bad effects, cheap stock footage, flimsy sets, and bad script all plague TIGERS.

Republic made little effort to hide the California filming location and even used the WRONG PLANES!  There is little mention of the OSS-AVG connection, and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the AVG, even if it were accurate.

The heroes of the AVG deserve better than TIGERS; this film isn't a tribute to them, it's a sloppy, propaganda film that does them little service
