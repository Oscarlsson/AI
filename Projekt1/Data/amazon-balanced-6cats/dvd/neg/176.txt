this has to be the worst thing they could do.. if you really believe in the Lord DO NOT BUT THIS MOVIE... it is based on many lies first off noah didnt save lot and his wife from sodom and gomorrah abraham did. and it was at least 350 years after the flood that this happen and after the tower of babel. but they have noah in sodom and gomorrah and then moving on and building the ark after its destruction. they also show a pedlar in a boat coming up to the ark once  everything is flooded and they have Lot on a ship attacking noah for his ark.. it is a half truth and in my opinion a MOCKERY and i will never buy anything again that has the name hallmark on it. how dare they sell such a lie to peopl
