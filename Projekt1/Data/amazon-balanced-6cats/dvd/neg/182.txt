This DVD skips quite a bit, making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie.  Also, the plastic covering on the DVD casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off.  I've never had a movie do that before.  I would think twice in the future before buying movies from Amazon.com
