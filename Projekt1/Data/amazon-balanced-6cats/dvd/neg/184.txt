The so-called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic.  It is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor.  A three year old will laugh at anything.  Every turn of the plot is stupid.  This is in the running for the worst movie ever made.  I don't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure.  I hope that Bruce Willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now.  I think he is a very good actor.  It's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in, to get his career going
