Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise, and I really enjoyed the ride.   The second season, however, doesn't live up to the quality of the first.  Instead of one large mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve.  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another would pop right up without any resolution for the first.  Many episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and asking, "Is that it?  Where's the rest of it?"  This happened quite a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring.  Are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist?  That's totally out of character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear about the incident again.
     That type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up.  The "major" villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer, and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable.    Because of the all the loose ends, go-nowhere plots, and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline, I'm giving Season 2 a 2 star rating.  Season 2 of Veronica Mars still has some funny dialogue, and some clever episodes, but it doesn't deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews I've seen.  I'll continue to watch, however, as Veronica Mars has a lot of promise.  Hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3
