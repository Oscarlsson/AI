Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of "King Solomons Mines". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic "Prisoner Of Zenda". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution.
