As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who "ruined" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.

Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).

Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see
