I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast
