This film is among the worst, most pointless, and most inane garbage that I've ever had the misfortune to view. Contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was CREEPY! The little boy was extremely annoying, and his relationship with the alien made me ill! Actually it made me more than ill, it was down right disturbing! His bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing I have ever had to witness, and the kids family was just obnoixious. By the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore. You are just relieved that the film is finally over. Watch it only to say that you've seen this.
