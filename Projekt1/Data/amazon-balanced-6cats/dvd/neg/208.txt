I'm sure such a movie would be approached with much hostility if some other group or religion would be the laughing target.  To imply that Christians are typically mean and narrow-minded is pure racism;this is just as evil as implying that all Jews are rich or that all African-Americans have rhythem.  What has Jesus Himself done to warrant such Christian-bashing out of Hollywood?  The man has suffered enough on the cross; LEAVE HIM ALONE
