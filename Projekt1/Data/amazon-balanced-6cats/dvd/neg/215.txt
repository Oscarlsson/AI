With so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been willing to look past that had I been entertained.
Special features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy featurette's. A rainy night rental movie
