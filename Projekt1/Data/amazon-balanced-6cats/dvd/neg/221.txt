Zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on Mafia, and on this tour.  Its really hard to take, and I'm glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on Shot To Hell.

BLS are a great group, but Zakk's persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles Blessed Hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the CDs.  Stoned and Drunk and Funeral Bell are critically altered to the point where I had to skip them.

I'm actually starting to suspect that Zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect, because I can't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way.

A few tunes sung this way I can handle, buts its total overkill on this DVD.

The behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because Zakk is a funny guy
