Those of you who remember Ryan Starr from American Idol know why she quickly became "has been" material for VH1's the Surreal Life. Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials.  The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time.  Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression & emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails.  That is all I can say, I would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again
