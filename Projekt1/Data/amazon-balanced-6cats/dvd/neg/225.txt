What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The Black Pearl but was admittedly  nervous about a sequel. As it turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original, major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but, unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say.

Depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often, haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or not. And don't get me started on the cannibals!

Any way, I think this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good.

And, as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it entirely. It simply was unnecessary.
