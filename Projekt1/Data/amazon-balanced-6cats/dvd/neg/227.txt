... for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the "next Riverdance". The dancers are all talented, if self-consciously hip, and in great shape. But the numbers that focus more on T & A than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess
