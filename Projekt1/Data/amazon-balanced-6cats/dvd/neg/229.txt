 
Pushing the envelope for explicit, over the counter home videos, 9 SONGS (Tartan) is about one year of sex and rock'n roll in the life of two lovers.  

Matt is a young glaciologist.  He meets Lisa at a London rock concert.  That night they start an affair.  In between attending more concerts, they make passionate love.  It's for real and explicit.  Nine live-concert song footage is intercut with their coke-snorting, sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship.  And finally, all this takes place in the memory of Matt as he flies across the vast frozen wastelands of the South Pole.  

This unscripted film is part musical, part drama, part documentary and part performance.  It raises questions about the difference between pornography and art. Controversial and much buzzed about, this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for what it could have been.  And of course the sex.  A special feature eliminates everything but the concert performances.
