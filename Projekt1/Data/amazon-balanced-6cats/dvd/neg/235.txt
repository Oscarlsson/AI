If I'm not mistaken, the ONLY difference between the standard 50th anniversary edition and the "Ultimate Collector's Edition" is

1) Collectible Robby the Robot replica
2) Forbidden Planet and The Invisible Boy reproduction lobby cards portfolio
3) Forbidden Planet original theatrical poster mail-in offer
4) Metal Alloy Collector's Case 

In that case, the "Ultimate Collector's Edition", at more than TWICE the price of the standard edition, is a rip-off!

The "Robby the Robot replica" is much smaller and much less detailed than the one depicted in the ad

The mail in offer for the "free" poster requires a $3.50 shipping and handling fee.

The "Metal Alloy Collectors Case" is made of very thin metal and arrived dented.  Not that it would take much to dent it.

Save $21.00 and buy the standard version
