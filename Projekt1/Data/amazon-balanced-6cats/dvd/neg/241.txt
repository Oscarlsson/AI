I didn't even want to see this movie, but my brother read the book and wanted to see it.  (We were unaware of the fact that this wasn't meant to follow the book...)

Everything was poorly done in this movie.  Even Hans Zimmer's score didn't save it.  I've mentioned that I'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars, and if I could, I'd give it negative ten
