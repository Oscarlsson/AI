How could Mr. Cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody?

The production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos, but the script and dialogue are so banal, the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another. (Including Leo, who was so good in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" in 1993 when I didn't yet know who he was, I thought he was really a cute little retarded kid... yet in "Titanic", there's just nothing there--- or nothing permitted). 

Talk about a SHIP wreck!!

Only the two studio-backed block voting resulted in the record-tying Oscar wins/nominations.
