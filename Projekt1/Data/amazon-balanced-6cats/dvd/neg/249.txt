If you love well written stories, great plots and captivating acting then this movie IS NOT for you.

I don't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie, however there it is!

It was SO BORING and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes I had to turn it off. I don't even want to know how it ended.

The cast line up was great! That's the only 'positive' comment I can make with regards to this movie.

DO NOT watch it. DO NOT hire it. DO NOT believe anybody who thinks it is good.

The two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly; get this, it was done in the missionary position!

Avoid this movie
