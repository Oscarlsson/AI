This was a hugely disappointing film. I did not see it on stage nor do I want to if it is ever resurrected. It trivializes illness, death, God, heaven, range of human emotion and love in all forms. I have grown up in a post-AIDS world and can see so many problems far worse than AIDS.I am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits. While America focuses on such banal subject matter, larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality
