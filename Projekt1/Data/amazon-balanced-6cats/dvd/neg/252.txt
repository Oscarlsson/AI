I saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on HBO and was interested enough to purchase the DVD.  Too bad I didn't watch the movie first when it was free!  James Earl Jone's acting abilities were wasted on this movie, and I won't comment on the others.
I'm glad that our armed forces are not as inept as portrayed
in this film.  Sorry I can't be more complimentary, but.....
