Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all.
