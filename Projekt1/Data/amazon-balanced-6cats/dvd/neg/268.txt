My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004.

It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and  domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.

I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!

As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence
