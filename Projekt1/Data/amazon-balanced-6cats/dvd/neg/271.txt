With the $70-million that was spent on the 2005 video-game-inspired film "Doom", you'd think that director Andrzej Bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly.  On second thought, given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of "shoot the mutants", it's pretty clear that Mr. Bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment.  As to the film's plot, it can be summarized in a single sentence:  a group of �ber-soldiers lead by their "Sarge" (played by The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig.  So, there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of "The Sphere".  Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include Karl Urban (�ber-soldier John Grimm) and Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam).  Why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in "Doom" defies logic.

To anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1-star film in a theater, you have my deepest sympathy.  To anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of "Doom" on DVD, please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price.  That alone should tell you how "good" this film is
