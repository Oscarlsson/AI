DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!!
