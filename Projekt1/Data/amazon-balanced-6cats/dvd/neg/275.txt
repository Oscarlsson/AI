This DVD was the first one released by Michael Buble, and I bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances.  There are segments of performances, but the editing and fast, wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect.  The performances get largely lost.  What remains is a LOT of footage of Michael and his original bandmembers drinking, clubbing, gambling, womanizing, and generally acting like rowdy frat boys.

If you really want to be wowed and experience what a live Buble concert is like, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND "Caught in the Act".  This DVD lives up to it's name as part of the PBS Great Performances series produced by David Foster.  "Caught in the Act" is slick, glossy, flashy, enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience.  I've seen Buble perform live twice, and I can attest that "Caught in the Act" is just about as good as being there
