I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK!
After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL.
I FEEL CHEATED!
