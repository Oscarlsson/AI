Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift. 

There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds. Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD.  

This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have some interest. 

For worse, is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out. Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City 1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song. Im talking about 'Until The End Of The World'. In case you dont know, THERES an actual video clip from that song. Rather, they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here.

Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage. 

Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour). Cheers
