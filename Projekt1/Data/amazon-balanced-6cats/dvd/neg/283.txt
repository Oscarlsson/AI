I bought this DVD because I really adore the Strokes.  Good music, good people, good style...not so good documentary.  Whoever made this video should not make anymore at all!  The strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures & 10 second clips of them & the "exclusive interviews" were not that exclusive.  No sound from any of the strokes & no interviews with them...I can go on.  I mean c'mon...a documentary of the Strokes should at least have the Strokes in it, right
