I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all
