What a HUGE disappointment this release is.  I was suspecting that it wouldn't be all that great when I saw that the studio that originally produced this show, 20th Century Fox, was the same video company releasing it.  Well, the first season looks horrible.  The source material is all 16mm dupe prints, some parts of which are out of focus, scratched and dirty.  In all cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm.  Compared to what Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is nothing short of a disgrace.  We should be given pristine 35mm source material, and we're not.  I suspect Fox wouldn't release the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial fee.  Anyway, season one of DANIEL BOONE isn't worth buying.  I haven't seen season two, when the show started filming in color, but I'm now afraid to look
