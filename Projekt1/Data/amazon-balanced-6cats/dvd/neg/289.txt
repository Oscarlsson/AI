I'm a big fan of The Sopranos so obviously the F word doesn't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the F word and MF. The stories and characters are superficial, boring and unintelligent.
   People who like this show are the same people who think that what makes The Sopranos a great show is because people get "whacked" a lot.
