The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho
