Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people.  But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day.  The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism).  The film appeals to naive youth
