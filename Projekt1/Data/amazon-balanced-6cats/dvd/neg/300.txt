Guess I'm in the minority about this, but this PLAY (NOT a MOVIE) left me thinking that I wasted my money.  I enjoyed Madea, she is a great character.  I never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems. For me the only thing funny about it was when Madea took the stage, the rest of it was simply boring
