This movie is a rehash of the first, but it is a crappy, unconvincing, emotionally uninspiring movie. 

Let me guess what part 3 will be about: A guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time, does not alter that timeline the way he wants (i.e. always worst case scenario) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else
