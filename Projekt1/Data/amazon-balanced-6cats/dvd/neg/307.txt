JS CONCERT WAS THE MOST BORING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON DVD! MY CAT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING IT THEN I WAS, AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF JESSICA'S FRILLY COSTUMES! THE SOUND SYSTEM STANK! I WAS EXPECTING HER VOICE TO ECHO LIKE CRAZY. ALL OF JESSICA'S SONGS WERE ABOUT EXPRESSING HER LOVE FOR NICK. THIS DVD IS SO BORING I'M FALLING ASLEEP JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT.  OH YEAH...HER VOCALS WERE TOO BREATHY, THAT PINK THING SHE WORE LOOKED LIKE A FLAMINGO CAUGHT IN A SHREDDER, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE LEFT TAKE MY BREATH AWAY ALONE!  NICK DIDN'T TAKE HER BREATH AWAY SHE TOOK HIS WHEN SHE DECIDED TO WALK OUT OF THEIR MARRIAGE! NICK WILL BE SINIGING I'M TAKING HALF AWAY!, AND JESSICA WILL BE SINGING I SHOULD HAVE PRENUP
