This product was a bad choice for me. It was a poorly done product. It was washed out, the quality, both audio and video was terrible. It was not enjoyable to watch. The packaging was cheap quality. I should have known better. Pay more and get a nice set, and a better product. Don't try and save a few dollars if you want something to enjoy. Paper sleeves make for a cheap copy.
