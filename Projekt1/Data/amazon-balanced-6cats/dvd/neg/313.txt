Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story.

Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine
