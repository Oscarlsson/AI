I love David Cross's comedy,  I love his stand up, I love Mr. Show. But this dvd is not kinda boring, it is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  There may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd -- there is no accounting for taste. But 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released
