The most simple definition of [...] is sexual gratuitousness. Sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on, not providing anything pertinent to the plot.

You can't help but get a porno feel while watching Bully. And to think I was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully; but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in.

Was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl's crotch while she's driving a car? Was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes? You can't help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story. The very first scene is of a guy having phone sex.

Several things about this movie other than the [...] made me mad:

1. You're planning to kill somebody, then proceed to tell everybody, including the waitress at Pizza Hut what you're planning.

2. After you kill, you're so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting VERY strange and telling even MORE people what you did.

3. Which makes more sense? To decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend, or, to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh-ore. Bobby never put a gun to the guy's head to make him hang out with him, yet murder was the only option?

4. I can't believe Mr. Wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy's throat while he's staring him blankly in the face begging for his life.

5. All of the characters
