I'm a huge Orson Welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge - but I hated this film. I was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that I just didn't get it. The photography was classic Welles - the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum. Don't get caught up in having to like it, just because it's Welles - it's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world - this movie blows
