When I received this DVD, I played it on my iMac. When doing this, I discovered that there were Chinese characters showing at the top of the screen. The quality of the DVD images were dark and grainy. I reported to Amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated DVD, and I was saddened to not have a response from Amazon other than refunding my costs. Copyright is not only a law to protect publishers; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products. I feel that I can no longer depend on Amazon to provide my DVD orders.
