The Book from Alex Haley when I read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color, and everyone should read it, yes even conservatives, manditory.  

however, this movie something just wasnt good.   to long?  the over all acting?  

Spike, you make some great movies, Summer of Sam is one of your best, Do the Right Thing. Spike has a gift for cinematography, however 

Spike Lee Interview on ESPN? The interview said, 

interviewer: 
"Kanye West said that Bush doesn't care about black people. Would you agree with that? 

Lee: 
"Yes, I agree with that, BUT I'll go one step further and say that Bush doesn't care about people who don't have any money (whether they're black or white.) I guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on Long Island or let's say The Hamptons, you would have had an entirley different response from FEMA and his administration." 

But you should have seen how he said it, it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face. The dude is bold man, I'll give him that and I applaude him. 

Spike said either black, white, Mexican, or asian. 
But what he DIDN'T say was Italians!! 

That dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of Italians in his movies, they call him a racist all the time. 

HERE WAS HIS CHANCE to say something, and he blew it. 

just didn't happen to say Italians? 

NO 
So HE is a racist too. 

And so are the Africans in Africa, they never have liked white people either, so what about that Spike? Try going over their and applying for a job! 

And while I am at, the African Americans in even Baton Rouge don't want the blacks from N.O. coming up their! How come spike never said anything about that? 

Fkn whiners, so many the world over! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on TV and let the world see it for the fools they are. 

And ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling Da Truth
