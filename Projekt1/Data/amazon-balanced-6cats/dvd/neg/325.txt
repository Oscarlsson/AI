AFTER VIEWING THE AVENGERS WITH EMMA PEEL, WHICH I DO EVERY EVENING AFTER THE DREADFUL NEWS, ENJOYING REPEATS AND REPEATS AS WELL, WITH RELUCTANCE I PLAYED THE HOSPITAL DVD.

I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE. THE DIAGOGUE IDIOTIC.

I COULD NOT HELP BUT LAUGH WHEN SCOTT ATTACKED DIANA.  EMMA PEEL WOULD HAVE THROWN HIM ACROSS THE ROOM.

I HAD TO PLAY A FEW EPISODES OF EMMA PEEL IN THE AVENGERS SERIES TO CLEANSE ME OF THIS DISAPPOINTING AND TERRIBLE HOSPITAL DVD.

THE LOVELY DIANA RIGG IS A GREAT ACTRESS AND AN EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT WOMAN, AND I WAS SADDENED THAT DIANA AFTER ALL THOSE WONDERFUL AND EXCITING AVENGERS COLLECTION, WITH HER UNRIVALED BEAUTY AND POSSESSING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND ABLE TO DO HER  OWN STUNTS TOOK ON THIS DISMAL ROLE IN THE HOSPITAL DVD.

I SEE THAT THIS DVD WAS DATED 1971, THIS WAS ONLY 4 YEARS AFTER HER LAST AVENGER EPISODES DATED 1967.  IN HOSPITAL, I BELIEVE SHE WAS 33 YEARS OLD.

OH WELL, I WILL CLEANSE MYSELF OF THIS HOSPITAL DVD AND DEVOTE AN EVENINGR TO A FEW EPISODES OF THE AVENGERS WITH THE LOVELY DIANA RIGG AS EMMA PEEL.

FINALL, JOHN STEED WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOCKED TO SEE HOW EMMA REACTED TO GEORGE SCOTT THE DOCTOR. CAN YOU IMAGDINE IF JOHN STEED APPEARED IN THE HOSPITAL DVD TO COLLECT DIANA RIGG AND RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET AS THEY DO AFTER AN AVENGER EPISODE.

PERHAPS THEY WILL ISSUE HOSPITAL 11, AND BRINGR IN JOHN STEED AND A FEW OTHER GREAT ACTORS OF THAT SERIES.
