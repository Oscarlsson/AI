I owned the original VHS version...I quickly gave it to a friend of mine, free of charge.

Eric Johnson may be considered a guitar great (I don't get it), but he has the personailty of a shoelace and it is aptly demonstrated in this instructional video. Some people just aren't good teachers, no matter how great a guitarist they are. 

As an added bonus, his guitar is drenched in reverb throught the entire video, even during specific examples & demos! Say what?

Finally, the length of the video was way too long (or at least it felt that way. It took repeated viewings for me to get therough from start to finish).

Throw in a mind-numbing finale/lecture about patch cables, cable length, pick gauge, strings, theories on physics and you get Eric Johnson: Total Electric Guitar - Agonizing to watch & absolutely God-awful. 

Stick w/ Brian Setzer (THE rockabilly instructional bible), James Burton (Hello.....Elvis' guitarist!), Yngwie J.(THE only instructional video you need for precision shredding), Danny Gatton (1 & 2: encyclopidias of all styles) or B.B. King: Bluesmaster (extremely in-depth analysis/demos of B.B.'s style by B.B.) Instructional videos/DVDs. Even if it's not your style, these are highly informative, educational & entertaining. I highly recommend these
