Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie.
1. It is incredibly beautiful animation
2. The music is amazing
3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series
The Things I don't like about the movie:
1. The characters are not developed at all
2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread
3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.

Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series
