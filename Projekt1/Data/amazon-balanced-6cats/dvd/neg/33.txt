 I was pleased at the methods used to train your dogs from puppy to mature dogs.  IT covers several different styles of training, clicker and others. I would highly recommend it as a excellent resource in your inventory of training methods.  I am using it on my 9 week old rat terrier and he will fetch, come sit and down with a little help and yes even shake hands
