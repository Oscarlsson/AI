Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film.  It's so aggravating.  I want to chew my own leg off half way into it.  I know part of it is everyone is a "talker" of a various sort.  They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell.  I just don't think it works.  Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived.  The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves.  It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name.  Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen.
