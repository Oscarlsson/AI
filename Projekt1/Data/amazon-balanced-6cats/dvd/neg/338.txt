I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.  

The lack of quality control is too bad, because Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects, then you are really in for a treat.  Bruce Timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on Batman: The Animated Series.  Of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series.  It finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume 3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale.  I felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series
