uhmm....yah... this is a low budget "film", but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck.  i've seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art.  it's impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing Sideline Secrets; for even untrained actors this is bad, it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie, and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there wasn't supposed to be someone in the backgroung.  i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom & a garage into what was supposed to be a club - and at the end of the home movie, i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive (quite so too!) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever-so-hard to be a soft-core porn\thriller.  in all seriousness, this thing gave me a horrible migraine.  if you are stupid enough to actually buy this (thankfully my roommate rented it) invest in either a bottle of Advil or a sledge hammer - you'll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins...
