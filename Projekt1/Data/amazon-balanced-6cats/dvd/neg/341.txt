I understand that some fans would like to see more of their loved characters (this series is one of the best as far as I'm concerned), and I can understand the need in filling in a gap especually if the show hasn't been aired in a while on TV: but I cannot understand ANYONE who buys this DVD for ANY reason.

You do not need this DVD to "fill the gap in your collection." They did the same thing with Chobits in episode 7, another damn recap. There's no point in watching it. The series is great, stick to the episodes both before and after this DVD. 

Trust me, I know how tempting it is to either rent this episode, get it on NetFlix, or go out and buy it outright... but don't. You'll only be sorry. There are a myriad of reasons why the company made this DVD (posted elsewhere) but what's important is that it is a waste of time and money.

Great series (A+), This DVD = F.
