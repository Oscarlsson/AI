I really wish Amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars. This movie is nothing but anti-gun propaganda. I have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this, but it was like watching a train wreck...I just had to stay for the end. You know, for those of you who don't know...firearms SAVE far more innocent lives than they take every year, and mine was one of them. This movie CD might make a good coaster, but beyond that it is trash.

Some less than truthful "NRA member" (yeah right) wrote..."I really liked and enjoyed this movie. The acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention. It will keep yours too, just give it a chance. Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more responsible. I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching. However, I may add this to my collection!"

HORSE HOCKEY. Member of the NRA? More like member of the Micheal Moore fan club. This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. They even had to LIE to get you in the theater, as nothing was mentioned about it being anti-gun in the trailers! And saying that it was "a little bit slanted" is like saying Micheal Moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie!!
