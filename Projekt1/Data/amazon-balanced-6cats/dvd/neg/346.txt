Leary is a hack. He wasn't "influenced" by Bill Hicks, he STOLE material. That makes him a hack. How can you Leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack? Take it up with Webster's Dictionary. 

The exact bits Leary stole are described in the book AMERICAN SCREAM on pages 201-202. Bill Hicks was incensed when he heard Leary's tape. 

On behalf of Bill's memory, give credit to the original.
