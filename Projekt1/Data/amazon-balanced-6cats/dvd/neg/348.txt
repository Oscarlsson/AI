Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version.

The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials. 

The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has "deleted scenes," which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time. 

So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety.

So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why.
