Man did I want to like this movie.
Hackman is the best and the possibility of finding a mid-70s Gem was really tantalizing, but...this film is really, really mediocre.
First we have sub-plot city going on, bad mid life crisis stuff with Susan Clark and Hackman "Trying to communicate" about their failing relationship. It's tough on Hackmans character "Harry" see 'cause he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech. 
Don't get me wrong, this is no "MegaForce", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable.
This is just...mediocre. Buy "Harper" with Paul Newman instead
