My husband and I are both history and literature buffs, so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to DVD. We aren't typically hard people to please, but this film was one of the most boring movies that I've seen to date. It's not that I don't appreciate artistic, visually stimulating movies - that have a point. Perhaps, assuming we all knew the story already, the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass, water, trees...and more trees. Apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever (though I will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there), this movie represents revisionist history at its worst. Here we are presented with an idyllic, practically un-fallen and un-corrupted view of the Noble Savage juxtaposed against the muddy, disgusting, conniving white man. Perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some Native American life like scalping, or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs. It's fair to say, as the Post-Colonial talk goes, that Native Americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years. But by shifting to the other extreme, don't we fall prey to the same false stereotyping - just going the opposite direction
