The kit was not worth its price. The spatial effect is poor. I've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red-blue paper glasses.  No, I don't have visual problem, and I rigged up everything correctly.

The DVDs itself were not interesting. My kids were not impressed much. It were not made me happier with the pack.

Sorry this review seems against the others, but it is my truth. I've stored it back into the box.

I don't recommend this for you
