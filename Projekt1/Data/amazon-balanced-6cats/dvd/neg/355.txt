After enjoying "Cowboy Bebop" and "Samurai Champloo", someone recommended checking out "FLCL" aka "Fooly Cooly." If you enjoyed those previous titles, I would suggest steering clear of this particular anime. The art is interesting enough but the story is simply lacking, the characters are completely and utterly undeveloped. It almost seems like they are making fun of you for watching their anime. This the second dvd of three and has 40 minutes of programming. I read somewhere that this was not even a real show and that they threw it together to test out new animation techniques-- if you've seen all 6 episodes and are still wondering "what the heck was that" this does not seem to be untrue. Please I strongly suggest you skip watching this program because it is, simply put, garbage.
