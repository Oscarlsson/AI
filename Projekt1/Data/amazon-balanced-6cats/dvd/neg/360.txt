OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you
