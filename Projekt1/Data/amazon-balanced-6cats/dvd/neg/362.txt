I would often rush to see all Arnold Schwarzenegger films, i adore his bad acting "it must be the muscles" i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch, i can't believe how terrible an actor this man was "IS"  and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap, wow! talk about the American dream, i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time,trend, maybe the era, but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no! no! for me, this movie had it's moments! for a 8 year old maybe! for an adult you have to have a strong stomach, you i would never say this about Bruce Willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh! i couldn't care less do with this what you will i won't recommend it later folks
