Jennifer Jason...Can someone PUHLeeze tell me why she ALWAYS plays the same role! ANd why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution!The so called ~Bostonish...or upper crust--east coast accent does Not include..slurring your words as if a consonant was too much WORK.  It as if her upper lip is never engaged at all..Not even to smirk!  Does she have a BOTOX complex..USE YOUR FACE..Including your upper lip...
But then again...Maybe she was acting JUST like Dorothy Parker..WHo ahem..happens to be dead..!  ( no disrespect intended..)

Jennifer Beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance..WHY didn't she play Parker..I believed her character!  Gwyneth..Love her..!  Bit part..but she added a much needed warmth to the film..

I cared for one character..And the best part was his bit giving a financial report..I thought that was BRILLIANT..! BRavo..But Mr. Benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character..THANK YOU..

WIll someone Please make this film over..And Do it right..!  And don't just call up your buds..for a tupperware party and say..HEY..Lets make a movie..!  Dorothy Parker deserves MUCH MUCH better..I can't EVEN imagine the biting remarks she would print..How about..  'It's all about me..And I hated it..!But the costumes were nice..
