Unlike many of the reviewers here, I'm not a biblical expert and really don't care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible. I would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally.

The biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play.

There were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary "spice" (it didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story).

I'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals. This type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad.

To the movie's credit, the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie doesn't work.
