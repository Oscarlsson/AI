Die hard fans of writer-director David Cronenberg may find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in this sci-fi horror tale. That accounts for so many 5 star ratings by other reviewers. That was not my reaction to this film.  It was slow, uninteresting and the ending was a disappointment. I give it only 2 stars.

The characters stumble through a virtual role playing game and pretend they are... gamers. Duh. Cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film, he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles.  William Defoe is completely miscast as a gas station attendant. Jennifer Jason Leigh's wardrobe looks like retro-1980's. Jude Law does well except for a couple of unexplained accent changes. 

Beware of the tag line that says eXistenZ "makes the Matrix look like child's play." This film is no where near the caliber of the Matrix. If you are not a Cronenberg fan, I recommend that you pass on this dull film
