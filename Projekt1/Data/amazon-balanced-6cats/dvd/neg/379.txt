When I 1st watched Requiem From The Darkness I had high hopes for an anime show I heard that could actually by scary. To my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime. This show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people. The strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing. Also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered. This show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other. I recommend this show to no one and I believe Geneon has made a mistake licensing it. If you don't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a DVD not worth a penny (I wouldn't take it for free)
