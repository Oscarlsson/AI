This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out.
