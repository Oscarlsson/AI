This movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage I have ever seen.  Aniston's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him.  That is total nonsense.  I expected them to get back together in the end.  Real people do not behave like this.  Or maybe they do... it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country
