I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated.

She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.

However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the "outlaw" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny.
