obviously, the music featured here is of high-quality.  hardly sign of the times transcendent, but nonetheless very exciting (as was typical of prince's 2002 tour).  unfortunately the director does his/her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub-bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound, hamfisted camera angle switches, bizarre washed-out colors, some horribly cheesy effects and cuts.  for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity, it's a shame the director clearly hasn't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber.  hey prince, just so you know....your DIY "NPGMC" approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you'd been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you.  if it looks this amateurish then you just look, well...amateurish.  and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur-level presentation.  the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this.   i mean really, you re-shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam/antwerp footage was not up to par: i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this.
  
hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this, but casual fans (especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert) should definitely avoid.
