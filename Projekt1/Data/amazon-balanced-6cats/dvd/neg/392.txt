Warner Bros is putting out a series of "Signature Collections".  They are nothing of the sort.  They are studio collections. The word signature implies the best of the best. A signature collection of Hitch's work would not include several of these titles. The rarely seen Foreign Correspondent and I Confess. The failed comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The experimental Dial M for Murder and The Wrong Man.  The middling Stage Fright. Only Strangers on a Train and North By Northwest are signature Hitchcock.  Where are Psycho,  Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, Rebecca, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and, purhaps even, The Lodger?  A signature collection would include all or most of these titles with North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train.  Of course this would oblidge the different studios to cooperate with each other. God forbid. Warner Bros is developing a reputation for shortchanging and lying to its customers.  You're much better off buying your favorite Hitchcock titles individually new or used
