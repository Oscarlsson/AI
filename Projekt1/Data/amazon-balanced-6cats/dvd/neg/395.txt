There are just some trilogy's that should not be made - and the Wild Things trilogy is one of them. This is not really a trilogy per se, since each of the films carries with it the same story, with the same twists. If you have seen the first, you have basically seen each of the sequels... except the sequels are both much worse. Take out the big name actors and make a direct-to-DVD release... and you have Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough.

I am sure you all know the story by now, but here is a brief synopsis... "Things get steamy in Blue Bay, Florida, when Marie, a 17-year-old beauty, gets caught in a tangle of deceit and double-crossing after meeting the promiscuous Elena, the new girl at school. Will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme?

If you have seen one of the Wild Things films, you have seen them all. This film lacks the quality of the original - mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come. This disc does look great, and sounds pretty good, but the film takes away from the overall DVD presentation. If you want your Wild Things fix, the original version is the one to watch
