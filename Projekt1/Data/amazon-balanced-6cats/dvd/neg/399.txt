I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.

If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.

If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot
