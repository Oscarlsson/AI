The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the "comics" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring. 

Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.

Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it
