I had high hopes for this series when I started watching it, though I guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover.  Shandala is truly a wonderful character, pure and good, and the characterization of her is very tender, so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting.  Oh, how wrong of me to think so, because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings, the message of "hope" the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain's demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the "truth" is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent, good woman is the only way to save the world!  Spare me.  And if you think that I am disgusted by this message, just imagine what the Muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the Koran and the Muslim character's final opinions.  Although the story is technically good, I'm only giving it one star for the message of despair.
