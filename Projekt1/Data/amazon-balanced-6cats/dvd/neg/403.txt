Don't buy the directors cut.

Badder Santa is absolutely hysterical.  For some strange reason the director decided to make a "director's cut" that is a neutered version of "badder santa".

I bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from Billy Bob in the first scene was missing.  The celebration in the bar after the first mall "heist", where Billy Bob proclaims he's giving up drinking, was missing.  The next scene where Billy Bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing.

That was enough for me.  I immediately shut it off and Best Buy agreed to let me swap it for "Badder Santa" due to the false impression of a "longer and fuller" cut than it's predecessor, as is the industry standard.  

I was duped.  Please buy "Badder Santa" instead.  

This is a watered down/Walmart version of a classic, not an extended cut
