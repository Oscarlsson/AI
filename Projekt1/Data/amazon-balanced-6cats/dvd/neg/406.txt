Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of "global warming" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely.
