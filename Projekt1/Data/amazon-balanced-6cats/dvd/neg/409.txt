My boyfriend and I went to this movie we both hated it.  It was really pathetic.  Perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it.  Yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people.  It is pathetic.  I would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with.  Low self esteem.  Do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this.  Perhaps it is funny, but just do not be around one of these people in reality.  It is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are.  Not all men are virgins like this man, but some might as well be because they have no clue about women.  they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand.
