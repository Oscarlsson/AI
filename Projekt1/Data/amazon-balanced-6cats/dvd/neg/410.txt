This movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying 
the Gospel of John beautifully through the movie - and slapping Yahushua/Jesus
and serious scholars in the face with the other hand.  The so-called "scholarly"
comments, for example about how the Gospel was written 200 years after the events, are by and large
intellectually dishonest and quite simply
inaccurate.  Even the lowliest of Bible scholars, if honest, will realize this.
It is very sad to see people making a buck off the Bible, while trying to tear
it down at the same time.  The worst examples of Scripture put downs are in the 3rd
DVD.  I gave the movie to a relative without that add on
