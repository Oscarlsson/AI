A style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality - if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women, this movie is for you

Elliot's love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy, contrived and lame narrative - clealry it's about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback setting

It's alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthy

If anything, this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy.

Sadly it's been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are 'camp' and therefore funny, indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp (go read Susan Sontag boys) and how low 'gay culture' as plummeted.

There are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia, and a secondary racist commentary about Thai women 'entrapping' Aussie men

Trashy and not in a good way. A must have for no brainer gay men.
