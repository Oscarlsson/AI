For those of you looking for more Eva action after seeing the original series take heed. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The Death part of the DVD, part 1, is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season, and the second half, Rebirth, part 2, is new stuff, very good, BUT! If you buy 'The End of Evangelion' you get Rebirth AND a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material. So, don't buy 'Death&Rebirth'. Buy 'The End of Evangelion' instead
