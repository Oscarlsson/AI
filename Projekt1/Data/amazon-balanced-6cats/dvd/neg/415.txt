I admit that my expectations were totally wrong concerning this film. I was expecting a Spanish reworking of Noel Coward's famous play about the dead returning to humorously haunt the living. The advertising for Volver in the local media certainly led me to have this expectation. Maybe this is why I found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing. But even on it's own terms I found Volver a difficult movie to enjoy. Others see a celebration of strong women. I see a movie about murder, incest, deceit and theft. Every main character here is a criminal. Raimunda, her mother, her daughter, all commit one crime or another, some truly monstrous. Who is there to admire? This is empowerment? I'm trying to avoid spoilers here but suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this whole film.

Aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a director as experienced as Almodovar should have produced a tighter work than this. There are numerous loose plot threads here. The whole subplot concerning the Jerry Springer-like tv show didn't really make any sense. The restaurant owner seems to like Raimunda but nothing comes of this. In fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out, with no resolution. When the movie ended my first thought was "What, that's it? It's over?". People might say "Well, life has loose ends" but this is a movie, not life. It should have an ending. 

I know I'm definitely in the minority concerning Volver. My wife thinks I'm nuts for not liking this film but I really think the emperor has no clothes here
