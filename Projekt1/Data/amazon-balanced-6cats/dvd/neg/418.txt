I've always been a fan of Roger Moore's James Bond, but what I've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his Bond movies were, like, actually good.  "The Spy Who Loved Me" is not one of them.  Oh, sure, it's fun -- almost ALL of the Bond flicks are fun -- but it's basically just a kid's movie, and that's not necessarily a good thing.

(1)  Stromberg is a lame villain.  Yes, his underwater lair is well-designed, but it's silly.  Not as silly as that ice palace in "Die Another Day," but pretty silly.
(2)  Barbara Bach is one of the very worst Bond girls.  She's not an ugly woman, to be sure, but she was a terrible actress; she sounds like she's reading -- poorly -- from a cue card in ever single scene she's in.
(3)  Jaws is a stupid character.  Having metal teeth wouldn't actually make you capable of biting through metal.  The metal you were biting would resist, and you'd end up just tearing up your gums.  I don't expect realism from 007 movies, but I also expect them to not be outright idiotic.  (That said, Jaws is effectively used, and Richard Kiel was excellent in the role.)
(4)  The disco score is terrible.  TERRIBLE.
(5)  The plot is nothing more than a rehash of "you Only Live Twice," but on the ocean rather than in space.  Certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies!  Embarrassing.

I love Bond, but this is not one of the highlights.

The DVD is good, with a couple of fine documentaries, but the commentary track grates, because the director and other commentators spend WAY too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did.  Even if that were true, it'd be annoying
