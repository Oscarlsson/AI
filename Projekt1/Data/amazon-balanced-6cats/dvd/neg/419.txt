Do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer.  On many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible. 

On several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television.  

Don't make the mistake I made.  In hindsight, I would only purchase this collection if I found it in a dollar bin sale, which is most likely where these Mill Creek collections will be in a year or so.
