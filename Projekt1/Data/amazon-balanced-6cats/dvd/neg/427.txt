I'm not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the Season 1 & 2 box sets, which is how you're better off seeing them (at least they're in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes).  Instead I will be focusing on the bonus features.  Not the Violent Femmes music video, because that too can be found on the Season 1 box set, but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features.  I love the interviews and the "in studio" voice recording re-enactments, but I *HATE* how EVERY piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame.  You can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen, and even then it isn't clear as there's a bubble "shine" over it.  I'd love for Paramount/Nick to include all of the original, non-bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set, even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2
