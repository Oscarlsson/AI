I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video "easy to master".  I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.  I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing
