I watched the first half hour of this and couldn't get through it. I dislike Michael Moore as much as anybody, but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school. It's an amateurish, whining documentary made more for spite (and those 15 minutes we all want) than anything else. Getting called down by Michael Moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside (people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night) doesn't prove that Michael Moore followers are all waffling malcontents, dude. Overall, I rate this film FAIL
