This movie was just plain bad. It doesn't just stink, it reeks. If I was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment.

 I can't believe that the other reviews were so complimentary. It's the reason why I purchased the movie and I regret my decision. 

I should have read the reviews more closely. Some of the reviewers hadn't acutally seen the film while I am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film. 

Everything about this movie is sup-par. The script was horrible. The sets amateurish. The dialogue stilted. (And not in the funny style reminiscent of the TV series - which I loved). There are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink.

First the only footage they used was from the Batman movie. Not the TV series. I have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the TV series realized that this movie was so bad they didn't want to associate themselves with it. They didn't use the original Batmobile but a cheap rip off. I could continue by why make you suffer.

The chemistry between Adam West and Burt Ward is non-existent. And the chemistry between the `actors' playing Adam West and Burt Ward in the `flashback' scenes is substandard at best. 

This movie is beyond dreadful. There are cameos from a few villains from the original TV show but they're dreadful too. Not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad. I wish I could say I laughed. I wish I could say that I at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all I can say is that I watched this movie in dead silence. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVI
