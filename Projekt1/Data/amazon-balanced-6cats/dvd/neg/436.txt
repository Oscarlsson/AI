I grew up watching Sesame Street and truly love the Muppets. However, I have to say this video was not what I expected. There were some great vintage clips, but not enough muppets/monsters for me. This video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing. I would recommend you pass on this one and get "123 Count With Me" instead.
