My god. This was the most idiotic horror film since Blair Witch. All the character were utterly retarded. They had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all. Duh!!!!!! So the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons. And the ending...made no sense WHATSOEVER!!! The Ben guy is tried for their deaths. Sure that makes sense. It's not as though they couldn't find the mine where the ACTUAL murderer was and get a crudload of DNA evidence and dead bodies. Not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that EXACT place. Total piece of junk. A wasted opportunity for all involve
