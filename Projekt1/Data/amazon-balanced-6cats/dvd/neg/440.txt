This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards  corruption. To make the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story  with lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers, and  plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because there is no  option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of Euro sex queen Laura  Gemser will find this one a total bore
