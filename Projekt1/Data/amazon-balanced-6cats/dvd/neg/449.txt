Okay, I gave a pretty bad review of this dvd originally because it didn't play right.  But after viewing it without the technical problems, I would like to say that it is a pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter, a good addition to any collection.  Ancient muscle conditioning?  Not many dvd's out there on the subject.  I've edited my original review and it won't allow me to give it more stars, but I'd give it 4.  Sorry, Mr. Keen, if I cost you sales on this.  I commend you for putting this out
