Someone named "NDB" (and I'm willing to bet a princely sum of money that he goes by "NDBoston" in certain other online venues...ahem) hit it right on the head.  There is no curse.  There never was.  Glad that the phantasm of a curse managed to put Dan Shaughnessy's kids through college OK, but the Red Sox have had damned good reasons why they've lost over the years, and none of them has to do with ghosts, specters, curses or other figments of the imagination.

None of which takes away from the unbridled joy that we all feel in Red Sox Nation at this wonderful, beautiful championship.  

(By the way, NDB, Shank is still gonna prime that pump.  Check this site for enthralling details of the windy-titled "Legend of the Curse of the Bambino," due to hit stores in May, and deep-discount racks in July or August at the latest.)
