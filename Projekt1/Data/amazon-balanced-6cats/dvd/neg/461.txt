Well not to bad a deal.Most of the movies here aren't too bad(The Inspector General,A Farewell to Arms,A Star is Born etc;)and have basically clear picture and sound quality.It's true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good.There is a problem with this set however,after you've watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and I discovered this when we wanted to watch "The Flying Deuces" for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue.My advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale VERY cheap,and to just rent some of the better ones.We did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered Buster Keaton,W.C.Fields and Charlie Chaplin because of this for instance,(and after we liked Father's Litle Dividend we decided to watch Father of the Bride which was even better)so I have decided to give it an extra star just for that
