Ok, this is by far the most pathetic taping of a show (although Sweeney Todd comes to a close second).  Where is the show?!  They cut out the "Glory" battle scene and just had the actors come out and look happy instead of creepy like they should when they do the slow-mo battle scene (that was not in the movie...).  Also, where is "I Guess I'll Miss the Man?"  That's a BEAUTIFUL song that was cut from the movie why?  Also what about "Prayer for a Duck" and MANY others!!!  This is by far the worst ladies and gentlemen and completely ruins the show created by Stephen Schwartz and the great Bob Fosse!

Oh yeah, and Chita Rivera's "Spread a Little Sunshine" was pathetic, and the Players did not convince me that they were creepy and really wanted Pippin to do the "grand finale."

I was in this show and it was the greatest show I've ever done, but this DVD is pathetic.  Don't waste your money on the costly price of $19.99, it should be $7.99 because of how many great songs and scenes that were cut from this show
