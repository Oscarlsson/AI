King Vidor's rather contrived adaptation of Tolstoy's epic riddled with miscast actors, a boring script, and a hurried screenplay.  In short, another one of those 50-year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into Hollywood's vaults of oblivion.

The story follows the main characters of Tolstoy's novel such as Natasha (Audrey Hepburn), Prince Andrei (Mel Ferrer), and Pierre (Henry Fonda.)  The film is too short for the novel and the acting stinks: particularly that of Henry Fonda as Pierre.  Henry Fonda is as stiff as fossilized wood in this film; his pondering stare and preaching voice reminds me of a bad Charleton Heston film.  As far as the battle scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer, they are as sparse as they are realistic.  All of the costumes and props in this film are horribly fake.

In short, the only thing that remains impressive about this film is the fact that Hollywood bothered to put it on DVD.  Apart from that, the acting is as worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue.  Don't buy this film
