Where to begin?  Cliched. Pretentious. Flat. Static. Maudlin. Melodramatic. Homophobic. And finally, just plain BORING.  Start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute Patsy Cline young drag queen arriving the big city, pile on cardboard "colorful" characters like typical AIDS patient, porno star, and loud-mouthed Latina hot mamna, and whaddya get?  An amateur film populated with some of the most UNLIKABLE, UNATTRACTIVE characters ever, all spewing some of the unbelievably BAD dialogue ever written - and to think the (formerly talented) director made THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD also with D'Onofrio? Go figure.  Nice cover art, though
