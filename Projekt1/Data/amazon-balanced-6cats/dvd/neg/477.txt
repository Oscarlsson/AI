I was purchasing Rockin' Wheels (the one with the train and fire truck) for my son, and the Truck Adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together.  We borrowed the Rockin' Wheels DVD from the library and he liked it so much, I thought it would be good to have two different ones. However, the Truck Adventures is not as good, and my son doesn't even ask to watch it.  The songs are lame and so is the narrator.  Don't bother
