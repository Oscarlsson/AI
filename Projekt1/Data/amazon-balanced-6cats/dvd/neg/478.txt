My boys have grown up with Dave Hood playing all sort of characters like Busdriver Dave, Pilot Dave and Fireman dave. I was excited to get this new DVD as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks.  Unfortunately, there's a new Dave (kind of like the change that took place in Blues Clues) and it's just not the same.  The new Dave is not bad perse, but after years of Dave Hood's cheesy grin, I can't say that we watch this one much if at all
