Someone wanted to make Indiana Jones part 4, starring Tom Hanks and created a such puzzled labyrinth that I think the book author wouldn't be able to tell the whole story without looking into his notes. After watching this movie it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that you have vaisted 2 hours on nonsense.  5 Stars for special effects
