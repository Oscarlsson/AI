The basic pilates mat exercises are performed, which are okay; however, the cardio segment of this video is truly lame!  The instructor runs the viewer through marching, marching and stretching one's arm at the same time and, finally, marching and kicking back one's leg.  That's it.  How incredibly dull!  What's worse, the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched-tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration.  "Pilates for Dummies" is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates (do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio).  I wouldn't waste your time w/ this video.
