I gotta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea, Swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him. What's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain's character. Swain's Character is a hillbilly who like's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with, I never really got why Swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie. This movie puts a bad taste in my mouth, it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie. (Do not buy)
