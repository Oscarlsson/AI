I bought this movie for my husband because its one of his faves.  When we received it we found out it was a Blu Ray edition and our DVD player doesn't accept Blu Ray DVD's.  So I basically bought a movie I can't watch.  It should have been put in the description that this a Blu Ray edition for those of us who don't have Blu Ray compatible dvd players
