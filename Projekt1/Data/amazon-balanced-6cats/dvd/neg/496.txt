Men of a certain age will remember how, when we were kids and this was played on TV in the early 80s, we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed, and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops.  But those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for it.  

The other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable, especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter, and atop a parking structure, both of whom were in "can't miss" positions and missed anyway.  

Moreover, if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly.  It involves Eastwood being sent from Phoenix to Las Vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to Arizona for a trial.  The witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the Phoenix police commissioner, and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup.  Assuming a material witness can be extradited, which I doubt, the crime appears to have been committed in Vegas, so it would tried in Vegas, not Phoenix.  And if the ADA prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner, he could just dismiss the case, and there would be no need to murder the witness.  The idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous.  

In sum, the plot and the action were both absurd,and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus.  But those two scenes probably can't carry the entire movie for the average viewer.
