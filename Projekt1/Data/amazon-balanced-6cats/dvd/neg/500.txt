To say this film is self-indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement. Almost every joke in this movie that didn't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of Smiths other movies. Maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that, but if you have only made 4 other films (very poor ones too by cinematic standards) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego.

The film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid, although the humor really dosen't reach even that level. Here is a recap of the types of humor in this film. Making fun of fans, fart jokes, scatological jokes, profanity (yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself), making fun of miramax, making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film (I swear I am not making this up), and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew.

This movie comes across as crass, tasteless, profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects. 

Thank God I borrowed this movie and didn't pay anything to rent it. I won't be watching another Kevin Smith movie anytime soon
