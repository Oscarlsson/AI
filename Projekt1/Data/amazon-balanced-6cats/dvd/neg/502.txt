I really enjoyed the first urban legends movie, but this one I was not impress by at all.  I wish I would have taken these reviews more seriously that I read before buying this dvd.  This was an awful cheapo urban legends movie.  Theres nothing here to come close of where the first urban legends was.  I see now theres a third urban legends movie out, im not sure if that ones good or bad, like this one.  If you have a couple of bucks to blow, go ahead and get this one.  If you seriously want a good atleast kinda scary movie, look else where.

P.S. No wonder this dvd is only $9.00 bucks
