I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted.
