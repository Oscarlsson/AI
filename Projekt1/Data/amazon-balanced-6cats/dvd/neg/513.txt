It's been 30 years since I've seen this film on cable.  I decided to re-visit this obscure film and see if I missed anything in the initial viewing.  As it turned out, I didn't miss anything.  It's pretty much the same, routine Sam Peckinpah film, filled with lots of blood, guts, bullets and slow-motion action.  It's also a long, tedious film that is not one of his best, but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra-violence in their movies
