I take this title form the video store thinking in Wynton Marsalis.
When I was watching the DVD I can appreciate that the image is very good (not great, and I have a 720p tube TV) and the sound is very good also(not great, I have a reference equipment).
But the show is so boring¡ Look, you just desire this man stop to blow. The drum's solo is just awesome, but the rest of the show is to forgive about it
