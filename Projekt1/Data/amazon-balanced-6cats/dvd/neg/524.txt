    While the story may be entertaining in its own right, and ANY chance to see Donald O'Conner dance is worth it, this can be a very disappointing film to Porter buffs.  The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality. 
    The best examples I can give is the fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song "Anything Goes" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus (with horrific word changes) and "Blow Gabriel Blow" becomes a finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line.
    If you haven't seen it on stage it's pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a major disappointment
