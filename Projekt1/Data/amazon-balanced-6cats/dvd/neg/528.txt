Another film in the never-ending series of "Giant Animated Snake Eats People" films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade.  The creators of a maximum-security prison in the Antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile.

There's nothing more to this film than that.  "Boa" (also known as "New Alcatraz") actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness, which I don't think was a smart idea.  The technical team - photography, production design-set decoration, etc. - create a fairly effective, chilling atmosphere, but everything else about "Boa" is strictly routine.
Dean Cain does a job I would describe as tolerable, although Elizabeth Lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife, and the supporting cast (Mark Sheppard, Grand L. Bush, Craig Wasson) is just a touch more professional.

The film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can't see just how fake it looks.

I don't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with; other, similar titles include "Python" 1 and 2, "Anaconda" (the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997) and "Anaconda: Search for the Blood Orchid", and the inevitable "Boa Vs. Python".

The DVD includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors.
