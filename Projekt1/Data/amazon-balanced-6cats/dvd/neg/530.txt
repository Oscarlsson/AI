I have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this.
Even my old tapes from TV were 500% better.  The picture was faded, the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words, so looking away from the movie did not help.  It is also one hour long--but seemed like three-probably a copy of a TV movie as it also had cuts for commercials though I could not find any place that said this. It was advertised as a 2 Hour DVD-and it is--I guess, but I could not see any more of it.  At the end of one hour, it just showed credits and it was over. I am returning it-and it is the first copy of a DVD that I have ever returned for picture and sound quality
