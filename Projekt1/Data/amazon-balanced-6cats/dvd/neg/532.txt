While "Scary Movie 4" does work in getting out a couple of laughs, it certainly does not live up to the past three.  Many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly, are getting pretty old.  Although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as The Grudge, Saw, and War of the Worlds, it misses the funny mark just by a bit.  Personally, I felt they could have done a LOT more in terms of parodying these films, particularily with The Grudge.  The writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier.  And really, was it necessary to spoof films such as Brokeback Mountain and Millionaire Dollar Baby, both of which are not horror films?

I believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience, and is vastly different from what Scary Movies 1 & 2 offered (which I found to be extremely hilarious).  If you're looking for over the top funny, look towards the other Scary Movies
