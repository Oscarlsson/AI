This film, like most of his early work, is for Hitchcock aficionados only. I am an admirer of Hitchcock and also enjoy old British films, but I still found this movie tough going, not least because of the 110 mins running  time. The picture quality of this Laserlight DVD is not perfect, but it is  perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you'd expect for the  price. The musical score is also okay, but nothing to write home about.  Laserlight do however pose a mystery that Hitch himself would have been  proud of. This DVD has no commentary, no documentary and no trailer, not  even one of those awful Tony Curtis intros. So why do Laserlight describe  this DVD as a 'Special Edition'
