The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory.

The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends.  I would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst (yes even worse than this!)
