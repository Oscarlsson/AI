I don't consider myself a hardocre 50 Cent fan, but I went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of XXL.  It wasn't all that entertaining.  The documentary doesn't really tell the people anything that we don't already know.  We've seen all these videos before, but the video for &quot;Heat&quot; is straight wack.  The street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny.  The Show In Detroit isn't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that's being said.  The sessions @ AOL are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 Mile DVD trailer?  The DVD borders on corny, but the CD isn't that bad.  These are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs, but I had not been able to find the &quot;8 Mile Road (G Unit Remix)&quot; ever since I lost my underground CD.  Lloyd Banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this CD / DVD release.  If you're a Young Buck fan, you should know that he's nowhere to be found on this release.  Overall, The New Breed isn't completely terrible, but it loses its novelty after one or two uses.  The three songs on the CD are decent, but you probably have them already.  I would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 Cent / G Unit fans
