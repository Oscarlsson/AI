The only reason I gave this DVD set 2 stars, instead of the 5 that I would rate the show itself, is because there are absolutely NO extras on this DVD set.  No featurettes, no cast interviews, not even any episode commentaries.  While I appreciate the studios putting the season sets out in such a timely manner, I'd prefer they take a little longer and give us some fun extras to go along with the wonderful episodes
