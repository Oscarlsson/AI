Overproduction and heavy use of repetitive "special" effects (such as Rothbart's enlarged and projected image "flying" over the heads of Siegfried and Odette) make this version of Swan Lake funny.  Anorexia "survivor" Evelyn Hart's role as Odette/Odile makes watching the video painful.  She is horribly gaunt and looks too fragile to be dancing:  I was plagued with worries that she would collapse at any second. 

Not worth the money, in my opinion
