This is one of the worst edited documentary I have ever seen.
You can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes, slow motion, and unnecessary digital FX. 
I have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min MTV music clip or a TV add. But on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick.
If fine edited, all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours.
Each episode has a more than 2 min introduction... 
During the episodes you see some shots more than ten times.

By the way, I am a very long time aviation enthousiast
