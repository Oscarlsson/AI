When we tried to play the item on our DVD player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it.  We ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer, which worked properly.  I am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded.  I can see deducting shipping and handling.  But, a restocking charge -- that is outrageous!  The merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it!  Please remind me not to buy from amazon.com
