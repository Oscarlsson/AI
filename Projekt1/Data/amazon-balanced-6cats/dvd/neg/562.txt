This Scooby-Doo VHS is ABSOULTY HORRIBLE!! It lacks exciting adventures and silly antics of the Scooby-Doo team too drawn out and serous not anough scary monsters or surprises...too much boring details not anough silly actions that kids like....Plus its higher cost I paid 9.95 TRUST ME BUY Scooby-Doo 2 or Scooby-Doo Cyber Chase Those keep the kids glued to the T.V. very exciting Just the way we want Scooby Doo to be!!
