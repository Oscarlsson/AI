I was so excited when this DVD came out hoping to get the four Pittsburgh Steelers highlight films from the '70s.  98% of all this material is already included in the Super Bowl Collection Sets put out last year on DVD.  Why won't NFL Films step up and give us more??? This should be a STEELER-SPECIFIC box set, not some rehash of the entire season for all teams...

Come On Steve Sabol; give us what we want!!
