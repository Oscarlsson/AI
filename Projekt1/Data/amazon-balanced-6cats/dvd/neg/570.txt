The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points.  The wrong movie was delivered.  I ordered Honeymoon in Vegas and received Leaving Las Vegas.  And it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for Christmas.  So that was bad
