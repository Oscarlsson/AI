What a horrendous experiment in comedy...if you like Jerry Lewis, I guess you'll love this travesty of a film.  If you are a film snob, you will love it.  Personally, as neither, I am grossly disappointed and just really didn't get &quot;the joke.&quot;  It was trite and dull....there was no point....the plot...technology encroaching on humanity....well, good try, but again not for me.  If I am looking for a laugh, I will watch a good Coen brothers film
