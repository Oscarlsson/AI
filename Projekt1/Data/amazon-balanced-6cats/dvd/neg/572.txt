This could have been an excellent documentary, but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a "feminist wonderland," but that's exactly what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as: "Fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother." Yeah right! Unless of course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians.
