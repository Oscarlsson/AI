I bought the DVD for my collection after watching the film on TCM.  The musical perfomances are terrific.  Upon receiving the DVD, I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD production.  The DVD states Digital sound, but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on TCM.
