there's nothing you can tell clearly about this movie, because from the very beginning to the end, i've just heard lota f words; f....this, f....that, typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks. and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid, and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked, and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness, or if they thought by simply using this big F word and they could kill thy kingdom come, then america might not look like what we're seeing now. maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world, maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what? they're just using that word to kill each other. or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big F word to talk the talk? i don't have any clue, man
