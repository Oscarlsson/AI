This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!).  It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.  

The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing.  Save your money!
