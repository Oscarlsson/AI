Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.

It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.

You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project. 

Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed
