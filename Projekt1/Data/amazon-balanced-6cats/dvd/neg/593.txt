I was also disappointed with this DVD, as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers.  I think the title, "Yoga for Beginners" is misleading, as this DVD contains many advanced yoga routines.  Also, on the back of the DVD it said it contained a "Core Workout 20 Min." but no such workout is actually on the DVD!

I purchase the "Pilates for Inflexible People" at the same time as this DVD, and I much prefer it.  Although, I wish I'd known that two of the workouts from the pilates DVD were on the yoga DVD before I bought them both.
