I did not like this DVD at all.  It requires too many props such as bricks, belts, towels, blankets, chairs, etc... Each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations.  As a beginner I find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention.  I feel it was a waste of money and don't recommend it
