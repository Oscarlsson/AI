What a great cast!  I mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie, right?  After it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it, although you are shaking your head in disbelief!  Stunning!  You've never seen anything quite like it!  If you are a fan of the campy awful, you may see it as a masterpiece, if not you will still have a unique viewing experience.
Proceed at your own risk!  Borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it.
Did I mention the great cast?  So many of my favorites...even Goodman can't save this clunker
