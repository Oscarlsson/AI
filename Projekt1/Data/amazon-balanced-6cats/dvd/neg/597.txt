Sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie, but Peter Sellers did many better films than this. "Dr. Strangelove" was the masterpiece.  "Being There" is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in Washington.  "The World of Henry Orient" (AT LAST on DVD!)is priceless but virtually unknown, with delicious performances from Sellers and especially his teenage tormentors.  Finally, the "Pink Panther" series is much better slapstick than "After the Fox," which has many famous, talented participants but is mostly silly, unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as Clouseau & Co. One irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations, as if we might not notice them otherwise. I agree with other reviewers that Victor Mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted, and Martin Balsam does okay with his stuff, too. When watching this film, I kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant -- I could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money
