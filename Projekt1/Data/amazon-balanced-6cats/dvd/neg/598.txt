I had not realized what great performers Michael Flatley, Colin Dunne and Jean Butler were until I watched this version of Riverdance. The lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions. What made Riverdance great for me was the precision, timing, and dancers dancing togeather in the Irish dance numbers. It is all gone here. Try "Riverdance: Live from New York City" or the video tape "Riverdance: The Show" instead. This version should not have been released
