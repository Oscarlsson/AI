This is a godawful movie, a waste of several million bucks by Universal and whoever else was responsible.  They could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the "sexy" health club craze of the 80s. Actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make.  Lucas or Spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so.
