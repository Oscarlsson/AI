$23 for the Chinese version and the English subtitles are mad.   The English subtitles available on American cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable.  I don't regret this purchase because I think drama sets SHOULD be $25 tops and the camera is so CLEAR on this dvd compared to what is seen on American cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are.  It made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for ME when I didn't really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable. 

So what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series?  I don't get the appeal of this show at all.  I thought it was really slow.  My favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise I felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk, breath in, breathe out, and ponder ponder.  I think the phenomenon of the show's popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring.  Just thinking about this show, strips another layer of elasticity from my heart. It's so boring. 

p.s. This drama got a 20% rating domestically but Sam Soon and Jang Geum scored 50%.  Hahaha
