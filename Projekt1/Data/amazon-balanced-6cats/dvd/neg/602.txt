Holly played by Kristen Miller (She Spies, Man of the Year) has a nice career as a journalist with her friend played by Brooke Burns (Baywatch, Death of the Supermodels). The 2 of them fight over the owner of a restaurant named Zucas (I think thats close enough) runned by actor Tod Babcock (Guard Dogs, Poor White Trash). When Holly gets pissed off at her friend because she slept with Mr. Babcock she tries to find a new place to live and low and behold she finds a new shy roommate Tess, played by Allison Lange (The Hillside Strangler, Roswell). Holly becomes close to Tess and they seem to hit it off real well, until Holly finds out some things about Tess that makes her think that maybe this wasnt such a good idea. Well, in 1992, Jennifer Jason Leigh did this to Bridget Fonda and now they make a sequel about it, wow, they must of went threw tons of scripts just to get to this one. Pretty much the young girls on screen are eye candy and the acting is pretty bad plus the twists and thrills arent that great. This can go down with Basic Instinct 2....in the trash can or the skeet shoot, one of the two. Also starring Francois Giroday (Carpool Guy, Framed), Tracey McCall (Not Another Teen Movie, Second Degree), Rif Hutton (Osmosis Jones, Halfway Decent) and Kyme (School Daze, Geppetto).
