2 1/2 stars.
This is a very good concert teaming up a pre-"grammy" Santana with Wayne Shorter of Weather Report fame. great rhythm section, drums, conga, timbale. top notch musicians, first rate performance, very entertaining. my big problem comes with the quality of the DVD. I don't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states DD 2.0, DD 5.1 and DTS, the menus are showing something else (DD2.0, DTS 2.0 and DTS 5.1) but neither DTS stream seem to be working. only DD stereo works. I own close to 200 DVD's and all work fine, DTS and all. Bought it directly from amazon, I had it replaced and the new one is the same. This is not part of the great Live at Montreux series productions which are all great, no matter how old the concert is.
So the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star DVD quality.
