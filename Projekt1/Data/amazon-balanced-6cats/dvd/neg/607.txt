My HD-DVD also does not work on the 360 add on. I tried the press OK and everything else I could think of. This disk just freezes right after the production logo when it should be going to the menu. This is the only HD-DVD disk that I've had a problem with and I have about 10 of them. I didn't purchase the Chicago disk as I already have it and didn't think it was worth the HD purchase. I did purchase the Eagles HD-DVD and it is excellent. That one also has a trick to it. It defaults to a PCM stereo file so you have to triger it to the DTS ON mode and then it is amazing. I hope its true that microsoft is working on a patch for Heart. I saw them last year and they were fantastic. Not as good as the old days but neither am I. They still surprised me that they sounded sooo good.
**** UPDATE**** Since Amazon doesn't have acceptible response.

Dear Dave
Thank you for you inquiry. We apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing with our product, but the problem is not with the software. This issue is isolated to the Xbox add-on, as our product plays as intended on all stand-alone players. Our replicator initially found this problem and has been working directly with Microsoft and they are close to resolving this issue. We remain in communication with both the replicator and Microsoft and we believe that an announcement will be made as soon as a firmware upgrade is available, after which time, your disc will play as intended.
Again, we apologize for this temporary inconvenience. 
Thank you
