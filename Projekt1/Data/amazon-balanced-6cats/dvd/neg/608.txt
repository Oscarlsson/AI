This has a run down of the colts season from game one to the Super Bowl.Thats it.Do not expect the Super Bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is.Very disappointing.The AFC championship game of the week is just a post game show.I would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game.It was better then the Super Bowl.The only good things where the few extras with Manning and Harrison wired for sound.I hope there is a better one come'n cause this is not worth much
