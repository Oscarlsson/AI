Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it.
I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better.

DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic.
Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better
