Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself
