Okay, the rating above is not going to be liked but I have to be truthful.

The only good thing going for this movie was the return of "Snake Plissken".

This film's plot was essentially a rehash of the original "Escape From New York"...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make this a better movie)... 

When I go to a sequel I expect to get what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters.

Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them.
 
Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President, Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene - Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the mission)  to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict.

I guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling..

I also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer...
"Carpenter....Russell! " Please don't tell me "money" caused you to revisit a "cult figure"! 

Some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of  Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier.  Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!

Sorry, Snake...."I don't love L.A."

The-Big-Green-Pointy-Eared-One!
