Even though Amanda is quite attractive, the camera work is bad, the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga DVD a bitter disappointment. There are few close-ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window. A bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better. If you are looking for an accidentally soft focus DVD of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost, this is for you
