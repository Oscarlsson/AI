Avril's music is ok but I hate this DVD. She's trying to be "gothic" or whatever and it doesn't work. It looks like she shopped at Hot Topic or something. Avril, quit being goth! You have no reason too! And you aren't gothic. Therefore, get singing lessons, and make a CD...because girl sorry you can't sing. But yeah, Avril plays the guitar so it's ok but 1 star for this goth imitation DVD
