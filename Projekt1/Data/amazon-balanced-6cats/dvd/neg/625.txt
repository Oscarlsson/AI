A woman who lives in an apartment in NYC and can't cook and doesn't have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about. (She writes a very popular domestic advice column.) She succeeds, until a Navy hero wins the opportunity to spend Christmas with her in her house in Connecticut, enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby. Problem is, she doesn't have any of those things. She borrows the house (from a man who wants to marry her), she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house, and she even borrows a baby. The unmaking beings when she tells the Navy man her child is a boy, and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it's really a girl. Then the mother of the baby takes it back, and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one. Then the woman is falling in love with the Navy man (and he with her) while the man from whom she's borrowed the house still believes she's going to marry him, and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding.  

It's a delightful movie. Very funny, and rich in both plot and character development.  Unfortunately, what probably makes it not a classic by today's standards, it is a bit plodding.  It does not move at the same pace as, for example, the movie Casablanca, with which it shares some of the same supporting actors
