After seeing Match Point, which I loved, I figured I had to see Scoop. All I can say is "Oh my GAWD!"
Scoop is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Woody Allen really should stay out of his own movies. And the rest of it, the story, acting, editing etc, were just painful to watch. 
    I can't believe he went from Match Point to this dribble
