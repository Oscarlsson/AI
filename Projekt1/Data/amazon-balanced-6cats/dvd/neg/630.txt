First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad. 

I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face.
