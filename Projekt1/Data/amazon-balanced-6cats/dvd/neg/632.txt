stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes' and steven seagal's. they are brain-dead movies with brain-dead screenplays, bad directors, bad everythings. this movie, like other viewers' said, drove me nuts. i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys' movies, otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration. amazon.com should also stay away from selling this crappy movie. god help us.
