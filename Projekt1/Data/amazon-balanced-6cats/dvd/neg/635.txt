I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!!
