The movie had potential: good cast and interesting plot.  Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't.  I did not find it all that funny or romanic.  It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing.  I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie.  Their relationship is not developed well at all.  As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort.  For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not.  I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute.  There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for.  My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful.  Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater
