Is Larry an actual redneck, or is it all really a joke inside "Larry's" mind?  I sometimes think that Dan Whitney (Larry's real name) knows what he's doing.  I think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him.  He is openly mocking them, and when they might get a tad uncomfortable, but then he'll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine, and they love him again.  Dan/Larry started out as a "normal" comedian (there's footage of him on youtube before his Larry incarnation), and wasn't really getting anywhere with that.  So he became a redneck, and is a multi-millionare now.  But all his redneck fans think of Larry as a "regular guy", despite the fact that Larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only NYCers live in (for the record, NYCers don't all live in fancy houses.  There's a lot of working class people in NYC who live in regular houses and regular apartments).  So Larry is taking advantage of illiterate, easily amused rednecks.  Just put on a flannel shirt, fart, wear a Confederate flag, and say you hate liberals, then fleece the rednecks!  I don't think Larry really has a redneck mentality (even though he's originally from Nebraska, so he has some hillbilly cred, so to speak).  I think he's just making a ton of money off of easily amused people.
