Git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as Larry the cable guy. Larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head, but end up doubling you over with laughter. His preformance will definitely torque your brain, so be prepared. There are a couple instances where Larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure. One such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun. I was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that Larry was just messing with me because we all know girls don't fart, they don't even have buttholes. He then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out EVER. Unless you are an idiot, you know you can't look like him without a strict training regiment, nice try Larry. He finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-Hillary Clinton piece. This was the icing on the cake for me because when I think of intelligent political commentary, I think Larry the cable guy!!!!
