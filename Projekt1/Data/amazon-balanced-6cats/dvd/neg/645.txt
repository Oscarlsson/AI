I got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it.  I bought season two and was pretty dissappointed.  The show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one.  I loved the ideas for episodes, but didn't care much for how they played out.  Bill got soft.  Cuddles and Dan got mean.  Buttons and Rocko stayed about the same, but it wasn't enough.  Great show, but stick with season one
