I have tried for years & years to get it. I still don't! This being the one Bergman film I seem never to get around to seeing, I made sure I saw it this time @ a Bergman retrospective @ my local art house theatre. Well @ least I sat thru it. During the show, no less than 5 people got up & just walked out. So I guess it's not just me! I personally found it to be mediocre at best. I don't get why folks think this is such an incredible film? The storyline is just so banal, as are the continuous close-ups of faces centered mid-screen. DATED TO SAY THE LEAST! I don't think it holds up-period! I have said it before & I still believe that if you want to see what Bergman was attempting thru-out his career, GO SEE "INTERIORS" BY WOODY ALLEN! He does Bergman BETTER THAN Bergman! And don't even get me started on Liv Ulman---ugh!!!!!
