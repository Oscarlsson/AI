This animated perversion of Star Wars is an insult to one of the best Sci-Fi epics of all times. The characters are utterly rediculus (seriously, if the jedi were that actually powerful, why did they need the clones?), there is no plotline to speak of, and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting. If you want a good build-up to Episode III, I suggest playing Star Wars: Republic Commando and reading Labyrinth of Evil and the other Clone Wars novels. Don't wast your money on this, it's not worth it
