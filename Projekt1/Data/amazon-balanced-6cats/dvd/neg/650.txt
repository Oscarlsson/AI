i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here,so i was upset when i watched this sad movie. gary graham(t.v.'s alien nation) is a robot jox,which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought! the f/x are not very good and the story is paper thin,only the acting is good,but it can't save this one from being just a let down. skip it
