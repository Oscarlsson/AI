I was just using this tape and ended it half-way through to write a review.  The cueing stinks and is frustrating.  I am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using Firm tapes on and off for about 15 years.  This one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing.  Stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is SO FRUSTRATING.  You want a work out where you actually work - not waste your time trying to read the instructor's mind and falling all over the bench!
