These 2 guys playing Harry and Lloyd were so disastrous. They didn't even know how to act corny when they're supposed to. 

Jim Carrey might be crazy at times but I don't think he's this bad. The whole thing looked like monkeys flying around the screen. Nevertheless, it has some funny moments like when Jessica's parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet.

The whole idea of a 'special class' was just so stupid. Nothing made sense. I didn't see a single point of the whole plot in the first place just to get a little extra cash.

The first one was a lot better than this one. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were a lot dumber and a lot funnier. These 2 were worse than dumb and weren't even funny at all.

I guess 'Dumb and Dumberer' would be better if it were still Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels starring but nooo, it had to be these 2 who I don't even know. 

Please don't watch it guys. It may be funny for some guys but it's mostly corny like kindergarteners gone wild. Watch the first one!!!
