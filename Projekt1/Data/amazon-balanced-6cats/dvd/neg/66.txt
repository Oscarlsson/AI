 I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks.
