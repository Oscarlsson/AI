The first time I put this workout DVD on, I expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs.  What I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD.  I kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs, but it never did!  The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet.  Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off.  All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid.  I turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy Blanks TaeBo on instead.  MUCH BETTER!!!
