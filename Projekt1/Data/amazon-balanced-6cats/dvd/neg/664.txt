This was the word used by one reviewer, and it just about sums up the film. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto-biographical and introspective pieces of work. Usually these are binned, as the person matures. Asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well-heeled to let her have her way on film, instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority. But good art is more than self-expression, self-promotion, self-pity and self-indulgence. It should have a satisfying underlying form, say something new to its audience, expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity. Art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know, especially if it's told in a semi-familiar way. Most of what Asia says in this film we do already know, if we are half-aware of what goes on around us. Still, the girl has a cute face, and she's put a lot of effort into this performance. Something more may come with time.
