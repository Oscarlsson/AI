Colorado's San Juan Mountains from Durango to Silverton to Ouray is my 
favorite place to vacation in the USA.  So when I saw the preview of 
Durango Kids on another DVD, I decided to rent it on Netflix.  It is 
one of those movies where villains are cartoonish, and the kids, while
cute, outsmart all the stupid adults.  The first 30 minutes showed some
nice locations in and around Durango, including the steam train (that's
why I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time travel to save
Ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore,
intended for young and undemanding children.  Don't bother unless you
love Durango as much as I do
