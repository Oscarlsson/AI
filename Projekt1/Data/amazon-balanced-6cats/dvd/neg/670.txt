This edition of the film sucks and sucks again. The wide screen version of this is a Masterpiece - without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that Bava intended.  Each shot was carefully composed(and not intended to be butchered) - this edition is a travesty -- especially when it's purported to be put out by fans - do you're homework. There are also scenes missing from this print, scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience. Hey I thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts -- instead its just sloppy and self indulgent. Look for the earlier laser disc edition ........... as for the extras do we really need the - it's great because I used it in my video slop .... and it's great because I did a bad homage/rip-off slop. The documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that's what was great about it. Then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image! Strikes me a total scumminess. All in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted ... by a few lazy lard-asses with a quick-fix mentality.
