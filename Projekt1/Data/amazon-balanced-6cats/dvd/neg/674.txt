The film seems to focus on 70's punk exclusively.  Anything post-1980 is glossed over, clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this "documentary".  I think the film does well documenting the roots of punk, seeing as how Letts was steeped in the scene at that time (although The Misfits weren't mentioned, which I found odd).  The interviews with Henry Rollins and Jello Biafra were great as well.  However, in order to claim to be a documentary, the evolution of punk rock is just as integral (perhaps more so) as its origins.  I think, basically, Letts based the film on his own opinions, likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk.  I was disapointed.
