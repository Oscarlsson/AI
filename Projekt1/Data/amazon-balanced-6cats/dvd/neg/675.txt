What was John Singleton thinking.  I know he produces good films but this is far worse.  The Shaft from the 70s was sexier, cooler, more aggressive, and classer than Jackson.  This was a watered down verison where Parks and Roundtree made cameos.  It's almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character.  No love making and ect.  Don't even waist your time! If you want to see it, check it out on cable tv or something.  Save your money
