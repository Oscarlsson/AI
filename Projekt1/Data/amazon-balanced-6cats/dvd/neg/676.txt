I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so.

Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not.

The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal.

AARO
