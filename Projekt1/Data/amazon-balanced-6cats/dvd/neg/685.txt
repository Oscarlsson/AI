 ( DaviD 1930's MOBSTER)...... This movie is based on the year 1935, The Dutchman's last year of life. It doesn't paint the real picture of the Dutchman or his orginazation. ( Dutch Schultz was a ruthless hot head who didn't entertain a thing. Billy Bathgate was supposed to be Dutch's Protege but was merly an errand boy (No gun play at all). There was almost no gun fights in this movie or the showing of daily operations which was still going on in 1935. There was a apperance by Lucky Luciano which was good but nothing shown of the Commission which Dutch was a part of. The best Dutch Schultz I have seen on Film is (HOODLUM). If your like me and want the real 1930's & 40's minus the watered down or mis leading facts, D your homework before you buy or rent. Or read the review and look for David 1930's mobster)
