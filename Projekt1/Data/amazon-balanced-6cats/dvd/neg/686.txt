This film starts out so promising.  It could have been a punchy dramatic piece about the nature of belief, and the legitimacy of the concept of free will.  Instead, the characters dribble into infantile sexuality, and the film becomes a travelog.  I can't believe this film found financing...a real waste of obvious talent.  The effect of the ending is to trivialise the opening premise, hence the film winds up being an exercise in meaninglessness with an unpleasant aftertaste
