I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.
