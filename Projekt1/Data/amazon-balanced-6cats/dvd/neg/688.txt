No reviews available pre-purchase.  Set was Totally useless.  Laughably out-of-date. Poor color.  Two disks had flasws at the ends.  I wanted to use them for a Bible study group, but wound up throwing the three dvd set in the trash.  The cost and trouble of returning for credit were not worth the effort.  -- Zero stars but one star was the lowest rating accepted. -- I exopected better of Amazon
