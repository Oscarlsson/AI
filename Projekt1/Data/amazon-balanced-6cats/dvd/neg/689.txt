I couldn't watch this till the end. Bad production values, gimmicky, desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the énnui. 

If you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken - both intelectually and viscerally - try something like Miike's "Ichi the Killer". Makes this movie look so, so needless.

The leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute. 2 stars for the eye candy
