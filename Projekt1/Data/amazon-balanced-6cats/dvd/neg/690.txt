I can't believe how many people gave this awful movie good reviews. The premise is absurd: namely, that anybody would even THINK about giving up three or six years of their lives to live in a hideous torture cell just so some friend that they barely knew in the first place won't hang - preposterous in itself - for smoking some hash.
My advice to Joaquin Phoenix would have been: Sorry, pal, but get a better lawyer.
A ridiculous storyline that wasted some fine acting talent.
