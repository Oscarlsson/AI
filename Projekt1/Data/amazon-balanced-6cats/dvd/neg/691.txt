I was disappointed in this video.  I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos.  In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series.

With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me.  It is the religious Catholic.  Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it.  I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion.  I don't enjoy worshipping the "Holy Father", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard.

If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video.  If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed.

And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not
