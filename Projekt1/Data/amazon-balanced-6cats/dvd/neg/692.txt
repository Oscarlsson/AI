With the phenomenal success of "The Poseidon Adventure", the first disaster movie of its kind, the sequel was sure to be a hit.  Not so.  A plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great.  Having a leading lady (Sally Fields) fresh from an Oscar win and a few veteran actors (Michael Caine, Karl Malden), might also sound promising.  Unfortunately, the magic of the set production of the original is not even close.  Instead of upside ballrooms, barber shops, kitchens and bathrooms, the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes.  The rest of the cast is comprised of television actors, who are as wooden as the script.  There's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous, you won't even laugh in disbelief.  Irwin Allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel.  Considering the original, that's a terrible shame
