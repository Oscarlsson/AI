I enjoy Greek Mythology and I love this story. Although there was alot of bad acting especially from the lead character Jason, who acted like he was stoned throughout the film. I was expecting the Hydra guarding the golden fleece but got a oversized Komoto Dragon(Lost me there) This Film had potential but the director went off on some wierd drug indused trip.  Overall I was dissappointed and was expecting more.  Sorry
