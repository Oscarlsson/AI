The animation ... Excellent.  The characters ... Excellent.  The premise ... Excellent.  Laugh lines ... plenty of them and well executed.

This is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on.

THE PROBLEM IS ... as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future.

For kids, they don't see a lesson in putting your past to rest, they see - If you don't like something - put IT to rest ... as is R.I.P. - DEAD!

After the crotchety old man (doesn't every haunted house need one to heighten the tension) identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows ... there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off (again).

Also shame on the producers of this movie... a KIDS movie ... there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour (babysitter getting it on with boyfriend, boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids, etc) -- it is just not necessary to tell this story. 

I wouldn't let any relative of mine, under 14, see this otherwise excellent flick
