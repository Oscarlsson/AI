I won't go into the movie itself, as other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that.  Suffice to say that I have always enjoyed "Cloak & Dagger," despite the hokiness of some of the scenes (not to mention the laughable visuals at the end).  This movie still rates at least 4 stars from me.  However, Amazon reviews are supposed to cover the ENTIRE product, and not just the movie itself.

In two words:  It stinks.

No trailer.  No subtitles.  No scene selections.  No extras of any kind.  Not even a menu.  When you slide the disc in, the movie starts right up.  When the movie finishes, it starts over again.  If you press the "menu" button on your remote, nothing happens.  Personally, I'd prefer it if after the movie finished, playback would stop and you'd go to a scene selection menu.  Even a still image telling you the movie was over would be better than playback looping back forever.

I suppose I should be glad Universal even bothered to release this movie on DVD.  It's just disappointing that they obviously didn't put any thought or effort into it
