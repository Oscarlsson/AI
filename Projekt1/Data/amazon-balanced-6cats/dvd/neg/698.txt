-Not a great one here, entertaining for all the wrong reasons, mainly because the film is so bad, so often.

-It is nice to see Christina Ricci in a movie again, as she's usually good even in a bad movie and doesn't do too bad here.

-Wes Craven directs this one and I could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation (much like Edward Norton in "The Italian Job"). I could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script, both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb. Also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects, as they were very lousy at times, especially when they finally showed the werewolf.

-As I said before, quite predictable the story was, both Ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck. Then both try to figure out what's wrong with them, though the brother is much more active about it than Ricci. 

-It's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was, the film tries a bit of a swerve, but it doesn't really work. 

-Besides Ricci, the cast includes Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie 1&2), Portia De Rossi (Arrested Development), Joshua Jackson (Pacey on "Dawson's Creek"), Scott Baio (don't ask me why) among others. All do pretty poor jobs, besides Ricci that is, the rest don't really seem to care, not that I blame them that is.

-There is some humor throughout the film, but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it.

-The only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew.
