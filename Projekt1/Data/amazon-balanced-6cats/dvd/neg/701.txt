The whole point of this ghost story, is like in the orinigal, a surprise, twisted ending. Yet, once again, in a 90's Hollywood horror flick, it is dissappointing. The actors within the movie are actually pointless and show no effect,but, there not to blame. The blame is the poor script writing for this movie. The movie has you going until about half way through, when they introduce the ghost to you. Now, unlike any other ghost in Hollywood history, this ghost is literally a black blob. It contains some invisible bodies and haunts people with its face, which in turn, reveals the face of whom it kills. But, literally, when you put a 100 foot ghost into a movie, you better make sure its in the right one. This movie should probably been called The Blob, not House on Haunted Hill. It is a horrible re-make and a waste of about 2 hours. Please, for your own sake, rent some good genre horror, like Halloween or When a Stranger Calls. Not some crappy remake that wants to make you leave the room your watching it in. Better luck next time to the director, producer, co- producer, and writer of this film, because of all the people that took part, probably just wanted to make some cheap money, so they made a movie. Better luck next time
