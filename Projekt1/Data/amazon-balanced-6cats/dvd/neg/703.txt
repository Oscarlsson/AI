Children of the Corn II~ Terence Knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage. The special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst. The acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production. The gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to Holly Upstairs acting school to write such junk. And to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me.
