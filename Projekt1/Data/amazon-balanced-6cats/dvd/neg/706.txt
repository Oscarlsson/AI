I had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea.  I don't know if it because I tend to like more horror type movies or what but I was really bored by them.  Each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way.  I know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense.  The movies were violent but nothing one hasn't seen before several times so I am not sure about the shock value of it...I wasn't shocked, disturbed or upset.........just bored
