I like almost all of Lifetime's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best. The name bring "obsessed" was not what it should have been called, the lady was dreaming and had an illness. This movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through, this movie was not what I had expected. As I said I like almost all of Lifetime Original Movies but I definitely wan't be watching this one again.
