Pick any house on any street. 
Pick any random two people(Man and Woman), give them a script and let them go wild.
I promise you could make this movie work better than the producers.
Nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring.
The acting and settings in this movie are just horrible. By the end you WANT everyone to die just to become interested.
Now, I don't usually give bad ratings and I really like "B" horror films, but the lack of effort here is unbelievable.
Just nothing to interest me
