I give this movie an "A" for "avoid."  Definitely the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure to watch (and yes, I've seen "Angel Eyes" so I do have a valid point of reference).  Chevy plays a guy makin' bacon with Farrah Fawcett (yes, I did just vomit) while Jonathon Taylor "Buy a Last Name" Thomas plays the petulant little crapface son who is anti-Chevy from the start (let's face it, who isn't?) and makes his life a living hell.  The acting is atrocious, the characters are poorly developed and hideously predictable, Farrah's nose appears poised to melt off at a moment's notice, and that little brat from "Home Improvement" couldn't be more annoying.  There is only one moment that is midly amusing (when JTT names Chevy "squatting dog" as his Indian Guide name), but too bad I heard that punchline in a joke my dad told me in 1982.  This movie is so bad that when Chevy drives his SUV off a bridge while rushing home to fulfill a promise to JTT you actually find yourself praying he can't open the window to escape.  If you enjoy banging your head against a wall, eating glass shards, or applying a curling iron to your bare skin, this is the flick for you.  Otherwise it is pure, unadulterated waste that a coprophagic dog would even avoid.  Trust me, if you value your retinas, avoid, avoid, avoid
