I resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years.  I make it 200.  The other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler.  I just loved the U.S Air Force personnel with Scottish and English accents.  They must have overrun the $500 budget at that point.
