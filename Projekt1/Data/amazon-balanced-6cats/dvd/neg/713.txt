Compared to Argento, I must say that Mario Bava is for me entirely overrated. He might be a pioneer, but as a stylist he is sadly lacking. His seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry, even if you like horror films.

Argento fans seeking out 'Shock' on the strength of Daria Nicolodi's starring role, music by two members of Goblin (under the nom-de-plume 'A.Libra)and Srgento's supposed giallio-based debt to Bava should buy 'Shock' with caution. Although it is an authentic slice of Eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror Hollywood churns out, it is still a fairly dreary, dull, repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances.

Finally, the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of Jess Franco's rubbish (and that's saying something) - my DVD of the silly 'She Killed In Ecstasy', filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better. Shame Daria never made films without Argento that are better than this..
