i totally agree with soda fizz because im 18 now and i grew up watching these old shows like doug, angry beavers, are u afraid of the dark, rocco, pete and pete, all that, etc...  they sould put those shows on in rotation and put them out on dvd, im sure there are tons of people out there who would buy them (me being one of them).  BRING BACK THE OLD SHOWS
