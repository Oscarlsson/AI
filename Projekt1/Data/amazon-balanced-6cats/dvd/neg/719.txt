This Amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series, the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny. Usually these Amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along, the episode with Christopher Lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and Ingrid Pitt as a sexy vampire thats it, what a waste
