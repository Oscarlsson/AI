Statutory rape is NOT funny! Neither  is bad acting or pretentious scripts! (well, okay they are--but unintentionally)..

Would have been sexy and funny IF: 

Oscar was 18.
Oscar was not a pretentious ass.
Oscar's stepmom was Lena Olin, and Oscar was played by Topher Grace.

Gawd! Why can't I get paid to churn out mindless crap like this??? Yes, I could do this movie better. I would dump the steady cam, for starters.

AAAH! End pretentious crap movies! just say NO
