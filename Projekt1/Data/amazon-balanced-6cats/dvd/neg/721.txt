I watched this with my parents and didn't like Marlons mouth. Reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something. He cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far. What is cool about that? That whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school AND my neighborhood. The rest of the movie was all right but Marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity. Sorry, that's just my opinion
