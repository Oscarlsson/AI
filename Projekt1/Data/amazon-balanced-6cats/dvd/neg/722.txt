With the all star lineup this movie had, I would've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the Gov. of Lousiana. This could have been a really good gangster flick - all the people were avaialable. Sean Penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something I really could not follow, could have put his skills onto something better. This movie is a complete waste of talent, money - you name it
