The movie has a great story. Unlike Streetfighter Alpha the Movie, Alpha Generations actually follows the correct storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie, but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately. The character design sucks(Why dosen't Ryu look like Ryu?), the English voice acting sucks(I recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles) and the fights suck. The only fight worth watching during the whole movie is Ryu vs. Sakura. This film dosen't even deserve a 1 star rating. I just gave it that because there's no way to go lower
