this a "mystery-triller" starring tom berenger,gretta scacchi,corbin bernsen,joanne whalley-kilmer and bob hoskins,it's the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive.she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically,crashing all the way.she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm,while he amazingly lives,at first leaving him in a coma,but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger.he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia.later,after being nursed back to health and "falling in love with his wife all over again," he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man.obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth.
it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller,but comes predictable fast.i knew the key 'mysteries' almost immediately and i'm sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law & order episodes will agree.eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments.i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again
