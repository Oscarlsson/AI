  THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.
  It amuses me that "fans" are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago.  THE TRANSFORMERS failed at the box office and I am glad it did.  As a fan, I was insulted.  Perhaps these other "fans" have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage.
