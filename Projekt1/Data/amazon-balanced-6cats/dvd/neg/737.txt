ridiculous plot, one dimensional cardboard-like acting (especially leon lai's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance), incoherent dialogs, horrible editing and directing, every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one. the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment. the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline. nothing deep but shallow all the way. just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves, long sleeves, and black cloak, even the white pigeons turned out to be dead. nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat. nothing at all. curtain call, drop it sooner than later.
