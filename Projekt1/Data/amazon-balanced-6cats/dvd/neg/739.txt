I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava, but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this film is just like all the rest. 

There is no point to any of it, there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says, "I can't have more ice cream!" 

So, I would suggest renting "Planet of the Vampires" because that is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note was "Lesmo", dubbed as the "European Peter Lorre" who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.
