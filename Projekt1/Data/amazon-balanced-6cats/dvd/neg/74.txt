recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc, the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc, and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad.

hurrah for the chinese.  alas, like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor, all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared, somewhere either burnt, or submerged in tar.  but speculation continues.  meanwhile, spaghetti was invented there, without which no italy would have arisen.  

oh, and crackers, they invented crackers, and bed posts first
