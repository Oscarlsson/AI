...this movie is a dud. Who'd have thought that John Wayne and the director of "Support Your Local Sherrif" would have joined forces for this stinker!

The characterization hints at being good, but really its character actors doing what they do best - being good support characters. Its a good thing to because the Duke really just mailed this one  in.

First - what this movie does well:

-Ann Margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy.

-the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show.

-it is interesting that the bad guys chasing Ann Margaret and John Wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end. When you get to the end, you learn why, but it works well to keep them faceless.

-the last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending.

HOWEVER, what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right:

-John Wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a cardboard version of himself - a cranky, mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character - and when they do, it seems very, very clunky.

-At least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long-distance shots of people riding horses. Sometimes, they ride over hills, sometimes they ride through valleys. We get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the Rio Grande (the border with Mexico). Fill in this time with some character development! Some dialogue! Anything!

-the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie.

All in all, it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so John Wayne could have another movie in the theaters. Too bad, a crack team of writers could have made it something special.

My suggestion, get "Cowboys" or either of the two "Rooster Cogburn" movies or "Support Your Local Sherrif" and see this actor and this director doing much better work!
