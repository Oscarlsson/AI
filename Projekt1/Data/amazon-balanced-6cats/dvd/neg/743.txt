The Technology on here is great but the storyline is going no where. What's the point? 3000 is creepy as usual and Big Boi's acting is horrible when he's paired against Terrence Howard. They only got 1000 screens nationwide for this movie but it doesn't matter. 3000 screens or 1000 screens, the bottom line is that This movie sucks.
