OK, so most of the reviews I read for this film said how great it was, well I for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing Angelina's breasts.  The acting was poor, the script was stupid, and the sets were lame.  I have seen some pretty bad movies in my time (ie Killer Kondom) but this one took the cake.. I would watch tromavision flicks over this one ANY day.  save your money. If you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week ;
