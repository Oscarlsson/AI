I will be honest I like Dolph Lundgren.........a look at his filmography you see B.movie classics such as "The Punisher",Universal Soldier" and "Blackjack" Dolph has been going trough a slump.........Storm Catcher and the startlingly routine Jill The Ripper and the awful Minion(AKA Fallen Knight) but with Agent Red Dolph Lundgren hits rock bottom. Agent Red first of all steals it's music from Predator 2......and it's plot from Counter Measures,Oh I'm not finished yet. It steals footage from Storm Catcher!!!!!!!!! The scene where Jon Penner steals the  air craft while posing as Dolph Lundgren..........Now Penner is 5'11 Dolph Lundgren is 6'5 for goodness sake! yet they try to pass it off as Dolph Lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission.....This scene made me wanna throw up but I hung in there.....It turns out more footage is stolen.......I swear I saw footage from Iron Eagle  and Iron Eagle II.......I saw footage from Crimson Tide and I saw footage from Counter Measures........What the heck was Dolph thinking when he signed for this junk? I have no idea. When I was a teen (When Showdown In Little Tokyo came out) I thought Dolph Lundgren couldn't sink lower then Showdown In Little Tokyo,Then when I saw The Minion I was almost sure Dolph couldn't do worse........Well I pray he can't do any worse because Agent Red is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life..........This is coming from a guy who likes Don The Dragon Wilson. Bottomline:On Agent Red's cover it says "Once exposed you cannot survive"  Take this as a warning
