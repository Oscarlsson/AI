20 minutes into this movie I was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based. The actress playing Cleopatra protrays her as petulent, spoiled and immature, whereas in the book one saw Cleopatra as highly astute, regal, and concerned first about her country and its people. In the movie she handed Egypt to Ceasar eagerly, whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to Rome. Likewise, Dalton portrays Ceasar as a complete ****. 

Perhaps if this were not based on Margaret George's Memiors of Cleopatra, I would be more kind in my review, but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because of some second-rate film-maker's idea of good story-telling. 

At 975 pages the book may be too meaty for most, but if you really want to learn about this queen, read the book instead.
