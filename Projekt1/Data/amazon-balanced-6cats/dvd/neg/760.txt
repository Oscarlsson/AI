I LOVE A LOT OF B MOVIE HORROR,BUT THIS NOT THAT GREAT.I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER HAVING GUNNER HANSON IN IT,AND GORDON LEWIS,THE STORY LINE WAS OK.THE GORE WASNT THERE,LITTLE SCEENS OF IT.AGAIN I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE(SHOCKORAMA)ANYWAYS IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT GETTING IT,I WOULD FIRST RENT IT.SEE IF YOU LIKE IT,I WOULDNT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FULL PRICE DVD.THE MUSIC SCORE WAS COOL FOR SURE
