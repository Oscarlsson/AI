I was so excited when I read the reviews for this intermediate level Pilates tape. Thought I would purchase it for variety from my 'The Method' Pilates tape. I was very disappointed. The tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat. I didn't feel like I got a good tone workout. I actually wanted to fall asleep. I felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student. I give two stars because I do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but I shall be passing this on to an elderly relative
