Although I'm a diehard fan of this great British sitcom, I can't recommend this particular DVD of it. When I received it I was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the recording. Comparing it side-by-side on the same TV with an old VHS recording I purchased years ago clearly showed that the DVD image quality was much poorer than the VHS. I believe what the makers did was transfer from a second or third generation VHS copy of the original recording to DVD instead of going back to the original. The focus is so soft that both my wife and myself constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image, which of course didn't help. I doubt we'll ever watch this DVD because the eyestrain is too great. If you don't have a good copy it would be better than nothing, but not by much

I was also disappointed in the extras. The "character biographies" weren't of the characters in the series but of the actors; very misleading. There were no tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the other additions that would have made this a first rate DVD. 

The radio broadcasts were interesting, though several different actors were used which degraded the enjoyment. Also, there were only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the DVD. Finally, while you listen to the radio shows only one image is displayed on the TV screen. This can lead to screen burning on some sets.
