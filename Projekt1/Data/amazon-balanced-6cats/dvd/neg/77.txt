Who would give the green light to this? 

It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is  a slight revamp to reflect modern times. 

Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie. 

"Dawn of the Dead" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances. 

Skip this one
