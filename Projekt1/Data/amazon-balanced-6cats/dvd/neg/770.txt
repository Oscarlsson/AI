Standard disclaimer: I LOVE Dream Theater.

However, this DVD is almost unbearable to watch due to all of the video effects that obscure the live performance. Didn't I buy a DVD of Dream Theater live so that I could see them play?? At times, several minutes pass without showing the musicians as they're playing.

Video effects such as swirling colors, images of the artists upside down (?!?), and black and white re-enactments make the whole affair feel like someone was trying to create their first music video for MTV in 1984. Or maybe trying to induce an epileptic seizure in the viewer??

Dream Theater would get a rating of 1000, but I'd give this DVD a 0 if I could. Just goes to show what poor editing gets you
