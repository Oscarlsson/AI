The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either.

Has Andy Dick ever been funny? Kimmel? Corolla? Sarah Silverman? Spade post-Farley? No. It's as if Comedy Central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years.

And the bonus features are horrible. The interviewer was annoying--even the guests seemed annoyed with her.

Was Gilbert Gottfried not available? That guy is funny
