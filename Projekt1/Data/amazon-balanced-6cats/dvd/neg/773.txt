Sorry, but this movie BLEW!  The premise was there, but the delivery just sucked.  I can only take the suspension of belief so far.  We are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf (whom he's been w/for at least a year) about his last, one before that, and gf before that.  At least two of them have his home phone number: they've never called? She's never seen the caller ID?  She's never answered the phone? Give me a break!  THen she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms. She meets up with Joyce (the most recent) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes, and starts believing that the bf should really be with her.  Joyce is none the wiser, but if you ask me, Joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model, calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone, keeps that stupid boomerang IN A FRAME, etc.  

This chick, Stacy (Brittany M) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going. Holly Hunter's character is precisely why I have more male friends than female. Stacy just met this woman and she's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie. I never expected the 'big climax,' but I did ask myself several times "will this Barb (HH) chick back the **** off?!"  

On to the climax:it was actually a surprise, but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for Stacy...after she humiliated all those people. I never got the impression that the bf (Derrick) was cheating on her, yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different.  The ONLY reason he pissed me off was because he didn't read STacy the riot act in the end.

This movie tries to wax philosophical, and you just end up hating all of the characters...except for the dog.  

A very passible movie.  I wouldn't even bother.
