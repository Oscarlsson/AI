As a character movie this is largely a failure, unless you find poignancy in "average-ness." The characters are all one-note half-stereotypes who seem to be sleeping their way through the non-existent plot. "Oh, look how average they are! Isn't it charming how they sit around and talk about nothing? It's so lifelike!" And the main character's seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her.
If this is intended to be an issue movie with the message Robert Ebert has suggested (that anti-abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women), it's taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows. Munich and Syriana also "bring to light" ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world. Perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things. Perhaps next they'll make a movie to make the point that, shockingly enough, the sky is blue, or that paint dries when applied to walls, or that grass grows. I imagine they'd be somewhat more interesting than this effort
