Seriously: the sound is the worst I have encountered on any DVD release, a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles - there is a lot of video jittery things going on, it all adds up to my conclusion that the DVD version is transfered from a very, very bad analog copy. On top of all, the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled. Dont buy this unless you are a fanatic WKW fan who already own all other releases.....
