When we watched this remake of Brian's Song, it was not by design. We had requested the 1971 version from Netflix, but the DVD was damaged in the mail and they resent the 2001 remake by mistake. But instead of sending it back again, we thought "what the hec, let's give it a chance." While we didn't expect it to live up to the beloved original, nothing could prepare us for how god-awful it was. So when we saw all the stars given to this remake, we were utterly mystified. Other than Mekhi Phifer's performance, which was pretty good, it was a joke. Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was a caricature; cartoony and over-the-top obnoxious. Maybe they had intended to cast Jim Carrey in the role but he was busy. Instead, they got Maher to do a Jim Carrey impersonation.  James Caan portrayed Piccolo as this outgoing, wise-cracking guy, but he was human and believable -- not a clown. And those football scenes. They looked ridiculous. At least in the original they used real game footage, which gave a real gritty sense of being in a stadium -- not at a high school or some sound stage. Even though the original was a TV movie, the performances, scenarios and dialog were well done, believable, touching, heartwrenching. If you watch it now is it dated? Of course, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is current to the time it depicts. But this remake reminds us of a very bad, melodramatic after-school special. Really, it was so bad I can't find adequate words to describe it
