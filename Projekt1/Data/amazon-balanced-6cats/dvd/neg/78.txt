Saw the knock-off series "Jeremiah" when it was the classic Star Trek episode "Miri", in which all the adults past puberty were killed by a virus originally meant to prolong life.  Also saw it as the Canadian TV series "The Tribe", in which all the adults are killed by some sort of plague.  Also read it in "The Kindling", by Jennifer Armstrong, a novel in which teenagers must care for the younger kids after a virus wipes out their memories and kills all adults.  

I laughed when the Amazon reviewer called the premise of "Jeremiah" "intriguing".  

Well, the other works don't have Luke Perry or pretty F/X.  Maybe that's the "intriguing" part of this latest adaptation of one of the most overused themes in Science Fiction.
