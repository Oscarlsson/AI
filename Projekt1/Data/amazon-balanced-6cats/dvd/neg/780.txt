I had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the Infantastic dvds from Amazon. I waited over two months, kept getting reassured that they were still coming, and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know. Not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme, but Amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days, which is at best a misrepresentation, and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can't provide the product at all at this point. 

I don't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available - Amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted.
