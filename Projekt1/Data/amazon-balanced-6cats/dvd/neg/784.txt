Why?

Why waste your time and money on producing crap?

Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with?

No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that.

What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero
