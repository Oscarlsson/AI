Good lord, but this was awful. Normally A&amp;E makes a mean costume drama, but /Benedict Arnold/ stank like rotting poultry.  The dialogue was stilted and incredibly unrealistic, the battle scenes were rendered in clunky slo-mo to cover up the lack of extras, and the costumes appeared to have been rented from a cheap Halloween shop (with the exception of the military uniforms, especially the Continentals', which were accurate). Aidan Quinn chewed the scenery into pulp and used &quot;historical voice&quot; (the lame semi-British accent affected by actors in costume drama).  Kelsey Grammer was pretty darn good as Washington, but his lines were horrid, horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade-school history text. Worst of all were the simpering John Andre and Peggy Arnold, whose rose-garden courtship scene was laughably bad.  In short, don't even bother to rent this. It's an hour and a half of your life that would be better spent cleaning the house or napping
