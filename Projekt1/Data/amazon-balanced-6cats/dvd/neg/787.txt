First of all, the trailer was the best part of the movie & had me expecting a totally different story ... 

Second, the story I got turned out to be the "Grinch Who Stole Christmas" crossed with "It's A Wonderful Life" (the latter of which was even more boring than this hokey remake) & doesn't that therefore make "Santa Clause 3" SO cliche & SO done before?!

Third, the kids in the audience seemed to enjoy it, but MAN was I bored! (& I actually enjoyed the original Santa Clause, so I can't blame the boredom factor on the fact that this is supposed to be a kids' movie ... )

Fourth, I found the Christmas council to be extremely offensive (read: inappropriately pagan for a movie that is ostensibly about Christmas).

*****WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP!*****SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!*****READ NO FARTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE!*****

Fifth, I found Jack Frost's conversion to be ... 

zzzzzzzzzzz

Whazzat? Oof. I must have dozed off for a minute. Sorry. Now what was I saying? Oh yeah. Poor, pitiful, evil Jack Frost.

(ho hum)

Wouldn't it have been much better to kill him off than convert him? I mean, come ON. Is the converted Jack Frost supposed to be an improvement? YUCKY. He's disgusting! I liked him much better as a villain. Better hair. Better duds. I say: just freeze him off next to a wooly mammoth & be done with him. Or bring him back in next year's sequel (because you know there's going to be one). For goodness' sake. Do we always have to embrace our inner icicle? (hurl)

& sixth -- not only Jack -- but there was SO much about this movie that just didn't make sense! 

(yawn)

Okay, I'm done with it. It's not even worth the time I took for it ...
