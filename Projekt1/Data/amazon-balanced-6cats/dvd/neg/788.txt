i saw this for a good price.  i checked for reviews.  there were all theese great reviews. whatever!  the movie has pretty 
much no action.  the sound video actin is good, but its lonngg
and sloowww.  there was some good nudity.  that is the only thing keepin me from totally considering this as a loss. ok movie jus dont expect action jus anticipate the nudity cause that is the only thing interesting besides the falcon in this movie. i love falcons, so there you go.  i think of it as good enough to keep thats it. maybe ill pop it in to watch a long slow movie with a girlfriend. take this as the downside review
so all theese other reviews don fool you into thinking this movie is all tha
