Hank Chinaski can't hold a job, can't hold a woman, can't control his alcoholism, and can't make a decent friend because he wallows with the dregs of society.  Chinaski is the lowest of the semi-functioning drunks, barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor.

Unfortunately, the movie doesn't hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people.  Chinaski's struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into.  There's no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism.  The closest he comes to poetics, IMHO, is where he tells his ex-boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk.

'Factotum' is saved only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn Matt Dillon (Hank), Lili Taylor (Jan), and Marisa Tormei (Laura) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene.  The script is stilted, without any highs or lows to it.  The movie isn't near as fatalistic as 'Leaving Las Vegas', or as hard hitting as 'Requiem For A Dream', and without any of the comedic relief from 'Spun'.  The closest comparison would be the jaw-stretching yawn-fest of 'Drunks'.

Even if you love addiction movies like I do, or love Dillon or Tormei, that still isn't enough to recommend this movie.  If curiosity overcomes you as it did me, then rent the movie before buying it.  It's earned two stars for the acting alone.  Have a ball or something else to play with if you rent this, it's that boring.
