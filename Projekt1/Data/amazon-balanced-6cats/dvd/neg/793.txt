...I turned the movie off. Was that supposed to be funny? Yes, some kids' toy (that happens to be a small motorized/electric model of a truck) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village -I mean; was this taken from the original Stephen King-book then shame on you Mr.King -that's overdoing the terror already so overdone. 

Not that the consept of "Trucks" didn't appeal to me, but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so-called horrormaster so far -believe it or not
