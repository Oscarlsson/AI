This series represents the second attempt to revive TZ, and is vastly inferior to its predecessor.  The series began with some built-in problems, particularly the choice of Forest Whitaker as host-narrator.  Mr. Whitaker is a fine actor, but a poor  choice to host the series, and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes, often walking around while delivering his opening lines.  After watching some of these episodes, one can understand Forest's discomfort; he probably regretted accepting the job.  Another major problem is that this series came out on UPN, which has never been (and never will be) a leader in quality programming.  Although there are some interesting story ideas, they usually fall flat in the end.  "It's Still A Good Life" is a noteworthy example.  Intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series, and featuring original cast members Cloris Leachman and Bill Mumy (with the addition of Mumy's daughter, Liliana), this episode gets off to a good start, but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn, leading to a rushed, nonsensical, and unsatisfying conclusion.  This sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series.  Talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing.  This series resembles the original in name only, and even the worst of the mid-80's episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly, poorly-written, lame stories.  The kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged.  Enjoy it for what it is, but, as Andy Taylor once told Gomer Pyle, "Don't over-expect."
