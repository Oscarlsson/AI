A 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality, this Swedish import doesn't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place, wouldn't know what to do with it if you did have it, and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts. The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as "well-worn," which seems to be a euphemism for "shop-worn," "clich�," or "stupefyingly unoriginal." Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: "As It Is In Heaven" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the k�ttbullar?) 

A standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes:

-- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force;

-- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia;

-- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It;

-- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is "Best Boy," a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in "There's Something About Mary," or turned into plaster saints as here.) 

So, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of "The O.C."  Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction. And don't forget the moral of the story, rather comforting to me as an expatriate American living in a Europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis-�-vis the USA: kitsch is global.
