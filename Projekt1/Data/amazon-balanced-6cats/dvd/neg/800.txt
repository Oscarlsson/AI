Once again, the powers that be at Amazon have chosen to REFUSE to tell us if (in this case) the Darin/Dee flicks If A Man Answers and That Funny Feeling are in WIDESCREEN or not. Pan-and-scan is garbage, and we won't buy it!

(That's why I only gave 1 star for now. If they turn out to be widescreen, I'll give them both 5 stars.)

"Format: Color" doesn't cut it. Color isn't a format, anyway - it's a specification or type. Widescreen is a format (as is DVD and VHS, to begin with).

So why the deep dark secret about certain movies, Amazon? You list many others as being widescreen, so why do you go on to neglect so many other hundreds, though?

If it's a standard screen piece of junk, go ahead and say so, and be done with it, and we'll boycott it. But right now all you're doing by holding back this important information is SLOWING DOWN SALES
