This is one of the worst films ever made! And I mean it!! One of the worst scripts I have ever come across. The acting is hammy and the direction is very weak! There was no reason for this movie to exist! &quot;Turbulence&quot; was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels! No way! If you like the 1st mabye try &quot;Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying&quot; but stay away of the 3rd. This is one terrible movie! Believe ME!
