Alright....own up. Which idiots are responsible for the release of this "Musicals" collection?

Since when have "Pinky" and "Island in the Sun" been musicals?????

These two movies are hard hitting dramas with a similar inter-racial relationships theme.

Would someone please tell them that, just because Harry Belafonte sings the title song over the credits, this does NOT make "Island in the Sun" a musical.

I suppose in their book, because Shirley Bassey sings the title song over the credits, this makes "Goldfinger" a musical too ??

It makes me so mad that we have idiots in charge of releasing these great old movies who have no idea what they are doing.
It seems to be a case of "..oh, just grab  six movies off that shelf and lump them together.".

If they don't know which are the best titles to release in a certain set, why don't they ASK someone who does know?
