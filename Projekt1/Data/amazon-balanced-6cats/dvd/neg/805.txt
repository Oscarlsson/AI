THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone. 

This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.

Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen). 

By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother.

Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray.

Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original.
