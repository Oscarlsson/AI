This video's only redeeming quality is its excellent pilates instruction.  Like all Stott videos this one takes extra care to explain proper form and technique.  Unfortunately, the aerobics portion is extremely boring and simple.  You just walk in place the whole time with no interesting variations.  

If you are looking for a video for a beginner, this one might work for you if you are truly new to exercise and are REALLY out of shape.  Although I consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercise, this video was too easy for me.  I haven't exercised consistently in several years.  However, I do have a moderately active lifestyle.  I walk and hike on occassion and I play with my kids at the park--that sort of thing.  If you have trouble with everyday activities because you are out of shape, this would be a great place to start.  If you are somewhat fit, this video might be too easy for you as well.  

You might also like this video if you feel like you have no coordination.  There are no fancy moves at all.  If you can walk, you can do this video.  I like simple steps, but this was too simple.  

In general, though, I think you'd be better off saving your money and taking a walk.  Spend your money on one of the other excellent Stott videos that focuses exclusively on pilates
