A broad range of Jewish-related-topic movies varies from "Trembling before the G...d" to "The Holy Land", where Jewish humor, emphasis on the Holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of.  Of course, modern Israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day-by-day Israeli reality, incorporating      h o h m e s    (sarcastic jokes) if necessary.     

Something more linking to a secular modern American reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex-bent traditionally-characteristic  inter-religious-confession-gesheft (profit) pieces of gay-lesbian-adultery-quickie-drug-secular-Hasidic traces of affairs, which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly.

Sorry, it is definitely not my cap of tea. If even this play is R-rated.
