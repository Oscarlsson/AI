Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].  Their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding.  After this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization.
The Lakers have been a good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the Bus.  The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which are much better than the present Lakers.
I recently attended a game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself think over Phil Jackson's mantra "I told you so."
Further illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow.
So it is understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly.  
There are some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the Baylor, Chamberlain, West days.  I recommend any Laker fan to purchase this DVD set to relive the past.
So Laker fans, keep living in the past if you so desire.  Maybe Kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA Championship promised land once again.
Long live the Forum [or the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the Lakers home now
