Overall, I have always enjoyed Robin William and Billy Crystal's performance in many other movies, but I must admit  to my surprise that it wasn't making me laughing on the floor as I usually do. The script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing. Didn't like the ending. It was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them.  Which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it's normal for mothers to lie.  I hope someday to see both Robin and Billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one
