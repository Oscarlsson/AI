Not what I expected when renting this movie. As others have said Clarissa came off too pure and innocent.  Futhermore, I don't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world?  Everyone knows what Lovelace has done..there are numerous accounts. Yet she goes with him anyway?  Blah.  The acting was OK. The costumes were excellent(I love period movies) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged.  And as another put it, I was very glad when Clarissa kicked the bucket.

I read a lot of historical fiction, classic novels and love period movies, but there was no liking this one. It just couldnt be done
