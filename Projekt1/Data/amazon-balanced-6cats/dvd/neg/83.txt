George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys.

This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package
wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.

However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then.


In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did.

By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way
better than the main feature.
