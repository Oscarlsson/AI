It has been a couple years since I've seen this, and I can still honestly say that it's like watching a Andy Warhol movie of Salvor Dail puking.  A kind of swirly colorful mess, with Brendan Fraser and Bridget Fonda stuck in the ooze of ick, and can't escape it's yuck of a screenplay...On a positive note, Jim Carrey isn't in it. Other then that, nothing can redeem Henry Selick, Kaja Blackley, and Sam Hamm for this putrid monstrosity, and I mean that from the bottm of my heart
