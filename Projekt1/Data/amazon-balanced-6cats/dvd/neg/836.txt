"A provocative and surprising thriller." (Fangoria) 
Yeah it is surprising, surprising-ly bad. It's also provocative, it provoked me to write this bad review.  From the beginning I could tell the director, Chris Fisher, was attempting to create a stylistic film.  However, after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work I gave up.  If you're using style, have a reason.  Style without reason is not style.  This film is one thing, if nothing else, a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots (also known as crossdisolving shots).  Drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you'll get the same effect as the camera work/editing of the film.  There's so much overlapping shots in this film, there's probably 2 1/2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is.  It's full of tallent, bad tallent.  It's more about naked women, sex, and drugs than the actual story.  I expected a cheap nock-off of The Life of David Gale. I would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this.  This is bad, annoyingly bad.  Some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing.  Annette Davey, the editor, should have her name removed from the film.  Unless, for some unknown reason, she's proud of her work. If I was studio head at Silver Nitrate Entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film, I'd have everyone and anyone associated with it fired, immediately without question.  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film.  If you enjoy good movies and great camera work, STAY AWAY from this film
