This version, bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story, but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story. The book was a simple good story, why did they abandon it  and the characters so completely?

The sets and costumes are great, but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period?

I have only watched the first disc, but it be a while before I will be able to force myself to watch the others.
