This pilot is so bad, the acting, the writing, the directing, the costumes...  It's a miracle that B5 ever got even one season approved by the suits.  At least they could have gotten decent actors - pretty much, every character on this pilot is represented by a piss-poor actor.  And the writing is grade-school (I think this is what real people do) tripe.

HORRIBLE, ROTTEN, USELESS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
