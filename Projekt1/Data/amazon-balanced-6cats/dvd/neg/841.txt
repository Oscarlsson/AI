No reviews for this video as the disk I have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of No Disk is displayed. As the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a DVD is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the DVD as i have to ship in from India. So I can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk.
