Second straight-to-video sequel to 1995's &quot;The Substitute&quot; has part-time mercenary, part-time substitute teacher Treat Williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students. Williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university's football team to a local Mafia goon. Pretty good in a dumb Saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then... well, Swiss cheese, I guess
