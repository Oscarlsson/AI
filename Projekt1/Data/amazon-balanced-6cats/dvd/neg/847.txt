By the title I would be led to believe that there is more than one George story. There is one George and a few others, one of which scares my 2 1/2 year old. I thought the stories would be animated. However, some (including George) are pictures from a story book. We love to read books, but videos should be more than photos of a story book. Would not recommend this
