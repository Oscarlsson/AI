There is NOTHING in this DVD that wasn't in the book.  In fact, Stan and John basically read the book to you as they show you the pictures from the book.  I was hoping to actually SEE the artists do the drawings, but there is maybe 60 seconds total of footage of actual drawing.  The rest of the video is just John Buscema tracing over all the images that are already in the book.  If you really want to learn to draw comics, this isn't for you.  If you just want a basic overview of the process, this dvd might not be TOO disappointing.  But if you already own the book, DEFINITELY don't waste your money.  It would be cheaper just to have your mom read the book to you
