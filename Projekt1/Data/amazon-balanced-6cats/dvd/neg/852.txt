This one was really boring.  Only buy this if you are trying to collect all the Scooby DVDs or if you have a very young child.  Very young children might find this mildly entertaining.  This is not a movie for older kids/teenagers/adults who are fans of Scooby Doo.  I loved Scooby Doo: Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, Cyberchase, and Legend of the Vampire.  If you want to get a good Scooby Doo DVD get those instead.  Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was a huge disappointment too, but this was actually even worse.
