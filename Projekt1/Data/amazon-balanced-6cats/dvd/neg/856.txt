This movie, while not a bomb or a turkey, has a couple of serious flaws. One is the casting. Ted Wass has lots of credits to his name, according to IMDb, but what a wimpy, character-less, uninteresting washout he is! Was Blake going for a Harold Lloyd lookalike? He got one, but there's nothing else to recommend him. He looks like a Clark Kent without the Superman suit underneath.

The other flaw is the length. Even the opening credits (using a deFreiling/Patie ripoff style) go on forever. But the slapstick, which is masterful as always (Blake having been raised on or at least heavily influenced by silent comedies, especially those of Laurel & Hardy)...my God, does he stretch things out here!

The cameos are the saving grace, especially Roger Moore's. His vocal impersonation of Clousseau is perfect. Why didn't he dub the voice for Clousseau in the concurrently filmed TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER? Whoever did that voiceover sounded like Sellers on helium!

It's sad to see our icons age, especially Burt Kwouk, who looks and sounds awfully tired. David Niven looks as close to death as he actually was. Rich Little's uncredited overdubbing was beautifully done: subtle and convincing.

Herbert Lom's Dreyfuss got bigger and more ridiculous in each successive film. And Harvey Korman's Prof. Balls is delightful. The entire scene in his shop is a stitch.

No, there will never be another Sellers (and I have no intention of seeing the new film with Steve Martin). But Blake could have done better with his stopgaps
