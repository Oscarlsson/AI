Take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same.  Really, is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids?  They deserve better.

The key point of this movie is that lying is bad.  Good point.  A device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks.  Also good.   Unfortunately, the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible (even kids will have a hard time believing a man can't tell he's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror), and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion, the entire thing falls flat.

Making films for children is a fine thing.  They shouldn't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children, however.  Quite honestly, I'd rather have a kid watch something like "Good Will Hunting" before this.

Don't waste your children's time with this film.  Read them a book ... a good book ... instead
