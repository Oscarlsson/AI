The strange and baffling career of Cuba Gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of Denzel's TRAINING DAY.  Unfortunately, Cuba's not Denzel and this movie is way below the quality of DAY.  Filled with enough foul language to fill the Pacific Ocean, the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie, filled with bad cops---where's the good ones?  Clifton Collins Jr., so good in CAPOTE, is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of Cuba who is going to testify in Internal Affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust.  All though this Cuba swaggers like a rap star and Collins has to try and act tough with him.  There's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film
