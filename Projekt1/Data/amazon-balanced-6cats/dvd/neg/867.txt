Having just read the book (most highly recommended) I decided to treat myself to the movie. I could have cried. While I did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book, I was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around.
In the book, the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character. In the movie, they got rid of one man, had the other eaten right off the bat, Pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy. In the book, Nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters, and he does not have an elaborate home on the island.
And what about those stupid giant animals? I don't recall reading about them. The fence around Nemo's home looks like it came right from Jurassic Park.

The whole story was about 5 (eventually 6) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there. 

On another note, the graphics were pretty bad. The panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy.

As one reviewer well said, it is suitable for children who are easily pleased, but it is nothing like the book.

Perhaps this is why Amazon sells it for only $6.99
