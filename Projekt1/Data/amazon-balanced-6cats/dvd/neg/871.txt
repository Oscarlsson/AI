What's wrong with this show?

1.  Jim wears the same pants, coat, and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series.
     
2.  A slow, sluggish middle-aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums.  

3.  Won't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her?

4.  Do you really believe that this middle-aged, heavy fellow would drive a Firebird - a tight fitting car?

5.  Angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
