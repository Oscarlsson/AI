One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately "Judge Dredd"  does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for "Future Shock" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and  "Dredd" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much!
