I don't know what the last poster was thinking... This DVD goes to the top of my worst quality list. I wouldn't complain as much but they are advertized as &quot;Digitally Remastered,&quot; which is obviously meaningless. &quot;Long John Silver&quot; is soft-focus, borderline blurry, throughout; marred with constant flecks and blobs; and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image. It's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk. Haven't viewed &quot;Captain Kidd,&quot; but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition. If that's the best the films come, and there's no money for clean-up, so be it. But get that misleading &quot;Digitally Remastered&quot; off the box. That's a hoodwink if ever there was one
