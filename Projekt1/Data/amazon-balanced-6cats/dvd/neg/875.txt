Anything having to do with Paris Hilton is doomed to be garbage. The premise of the story is trite and in the end leaves the audience wondering "whaaaaa". The only person not to die is scottish and that's the only reason why he didnt; because he's Scottish. WHAT????? Sick plot, dumb characters overall DULLLLL. How many movies will they make with "a group of friends in a secluded castle" Yes i borrowed the movie which is great compared to paying $20.00 for the DVD and wasting my money and time watching it. YAWWWWWWWWWWN!!
