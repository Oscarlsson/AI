   If you are looking for something shocking, don't bother with this movie.  
   rape scene:  why doesn't she run???? why doesn't she fight??? how come there's all this blood on her all of a sudden??? where did that come from???? stupid.                                                            revenge scenes:  first of all, i wasn't upset enough to thirst for revenge.  second of all, the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene. 
    what you've basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake, scene for scene, including every gratuitous moment. and it would get made.  it would show in theaters.  and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying.  go rent "irreversible" it's much better at this sort of thing.
