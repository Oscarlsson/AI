this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles II, but otherwise its just a mess. the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble, but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes, who also gave us such film masterpieces as "casino royale" and "chitty chitty bang bang". richard harris is his usually unrestrained self, and thats not a compliment. now, i wont even go into the politics, which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero: as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas's paean to charles II in "twenty years after", but nowhere near as entertaining.
