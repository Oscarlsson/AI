Amazon should send all of these 25th Anniversary DVD's back to UNI, the faulty product locks up after about 1 1/2 hours on both my Panasonic and Sony DVD decks! I see this problem also exists in the wide screen version from the reviews of that product.

Simply put - DON'T BUY THIS LOUSY UNIVERSAL PRODUCT!!!
