I've owned this workout for about three years.  I do it on occasion if I feel like I need to slap my legs in to shape.  It does a great job of increasing muscle stamina in the lower body.  However, I have to force myself to do this video.  The 35 minute warm-up is mundane and uninspired.  By the time I finish doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes I hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg.  I also find the way the instructions are given and the background music to be extremely irritating.  In order for me to get through the video I have to put on some different music and turn the TV down until I can just barely hear the instructor's voice to know I'm keeping up with the video. In my opinion this video is more of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience.
