What an incredible waste of acting talent "There Was a Crooked Man" turned out to be.  Director Joseph Mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as "All About Eve" and "The Barefoot Contessa" should be embarrassed by this bomb.

Kirk Douglas plays Paris Pittman Jr. a charming, persuasive prisoner incarcerated in Territorial prison for ten years for an armed robbery that netted him $500,000.  He hid the loot prior to his capture.  It's presence is common knowledge among the inmates giving him celebrity status.  Newly appointed warden Woodrow Lopeman played by Henry Fonda is trying to use Douglas' influence to coax the inmates help him initiate prison reform.
Under the guise of playing along with Fonda, Douglas secretly plots his escape to be reunited with his ill gotten cash.

With an excellent cast including Hume Cronyn, Burgess Meredith and Lee Grant, I expected a whole lot more than this disappointing flick delivered
