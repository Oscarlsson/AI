When I first got this disc the other day, it would not play at all. I installed the latest firmware update to my XBOX360 HD drive, and it played. However, it does not play well at all. The video is constantly "dragging" or skipping. The audio is fine though. 

I can't really provide a review of the content since, so far, it is unwatchable.

This is the only disc that has given me issues
