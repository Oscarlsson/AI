This movie has the feel of a late-night monster fest hosted by Svengoolie or Elvira. I had no idea what this was about when I started watching it, but by the end, I wished I would have skipped it entirely. The story starts off well, with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious monster (that you don't see at first). From there it goes downhill, it felt like a low-rent 'Pet Sematary'. I have never read the short story that this was based off of, but I'm sure that King made his scarier than this movie could ever be. The best acting in the movie comes from Brad Dourif, best known for his performance as Billy Bibbit in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and the voice of Chucky the killer doll from 'Child's Play', as an exterminator
