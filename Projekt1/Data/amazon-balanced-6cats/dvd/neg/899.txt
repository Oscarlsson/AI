These are great films and the set is lovely. But boo to Criterion anyhow for not sticking up for Cassavetes scholar Ray Carney, whose name was removed from the set after months of work because of his feud with Cassavetes' widow Gena Rowlands. Buy the DVD set, anyhow, you must, but go to the Cassavetes pages, find Carney's links, and read his account of the troubles he's had, trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of FACES and SHADOWS he himself tracked down... Sorry to take sides -- Gena Rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does -- but I greatly admire Carney's contributions to keeping Cassavetes' memory alive and exposing people to his films; he put an amazing amount of work into CASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, too. It sucks that he kind of got stiffed here.
