It is really just one poker player interviewing a bunch of other poker players - and it is not very well done.  There are a couple of good tips, but nothing I have not read elsewhere.  Save your money.  If you are a beginner, and want to learn how to play hold'em, check out Howard Lederer's 'Secrets of No Limit Hold'em' (DVD) and Phil Hellmuth's 'Play Poker Like the Pros' (book), more advanced players should check out David Sklansky's books
