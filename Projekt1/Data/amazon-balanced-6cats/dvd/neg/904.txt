This is an excellent film, which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor.  I was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor, inter-titles appear to be missing, and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don't match the action on-screen.  It's a shame, because a film like this one deserves much better
