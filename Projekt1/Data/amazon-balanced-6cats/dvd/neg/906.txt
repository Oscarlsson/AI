This is the worst ripoff of a major literary work I have ever seen. It takes colossal gall (to say nothing of immense bad taste) to take the bare bones of a Dostoevsky novella & tack on every possible bodice-ripper cliche in movies & then try to interweave Dostoevsky's own personal travails as narrative interstices. All done with no flair for nor flavor of the original. 

The acting is strictly mid-20th century nyah-ha-ha Masterpiece Theater while the casting is about as suitable as Ray Winstone in his infamous Henry VIII turn.

I got this just to see the great Luise Rainer. Now I will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed
