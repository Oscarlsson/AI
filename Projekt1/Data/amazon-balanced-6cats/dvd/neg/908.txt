I'm not a big fan of Bruce Campell but I was appalled while viewing this film. I know it's a B Horror film but there was no orginality in this movie. I know it's suppose to be funny but come on people, was it really? The only part that was slightly funny was when Campell's wife was going after the Gypsy for the first time.

Needless to say, I think it's interesting that this movie was a book.
Going off subject, however, on a late night talk show Bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a PG-13 horror film. I'll conform with that.
