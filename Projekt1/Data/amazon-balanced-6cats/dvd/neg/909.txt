I am an Alice fan, so this is far far from my favorite.  The first star I gave was simply because I love Kate Beckinsale and the movie isn't scary.  The other is because It would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that doesn't know anything about Wonderland.  My 9 year old even got bored with this.  Kate Beackinsale plays the Mother in the beginning, and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so.  She just didn't look well in this movie, and everything looked so cheap and fake.  The story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out.  I would not recommend this.  I would recommend the 1999 American mini series of Alice in Wonderland, it is my absolute favorite; with Martin Short as the Mad Hatter, and a long list of big names.  That one is fun for all ages
