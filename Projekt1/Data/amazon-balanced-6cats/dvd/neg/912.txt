This DVD is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show.  For a "best of" volume, I expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the DVD case advertises, namely "the best of" and the "scariest moments."  In my opinion, this volume fails to deliver what it promises.  I am definitely a fan of the series, and I know there are much better moments it has to offer.  About the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this DVD are some fairly decent examples of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).  Even though the DVD is fairly inexpensive, I don't think it's worth the cost
