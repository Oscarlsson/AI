How can you rate something that hasn't been released?  Especially since Lionsgate RUINED Season 5 by releasing the shortened syndicated versions while still writing on the box "The Complete 5th Season".  Debbie Harry is credited on the box while her scene was omitted.  This along with many others...

They completely ruined the boxed set by issuing shortened, crappy syndicated episodes.  This is coming from a huge W&G fan, or should I say K&J fan
