Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong.  Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for.  With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us
