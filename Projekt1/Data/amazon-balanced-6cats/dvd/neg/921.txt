I was very disappointed with this second edition. My daughter and I loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting.  The movie dragged out for the first half, and just got worse during the second half.  I continually kept looking at the clock, wondering when it would be over.  We only watched it once, and it will go in the rummage sale later this year
