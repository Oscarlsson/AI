I found this to be a absurd movie. It just has alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched, and the plot itself wasn't a strong one at that. To me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie, and it just didn't work. It tried to be a movie that all the family could watch, and it didn't work. It tried to be a disaster movie, and it didn't work. It tried to be a drama, and again it didn't work. I got a few chuckles out of it, it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that I watched it, but it was just sloppy, and uneven, and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning.
