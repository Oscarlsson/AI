My daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school. It wasn't until years later that I saw it, and I was HORRIFIED!!! This was a movie aimed at children??? What does a children's movie need a sexy bunny for? The lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and "strutting her stuff" on the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after her like a bunch of  sick, depraved perverts. This scene was highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that, the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities. This movie should be kept far, far away from children, and was truly deserving of zero stars
