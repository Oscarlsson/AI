Dare I need tell you how greatly this softcore, action thriller sucks?  Ok.  You might think there are two reasons (besides those two) to rent this: Nudity and Hilariously bad acting.  Well, there is nudity, but not as much as you think.  If you're getting it for Anna's naked flesh, be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button.  She's nude, don't get me wrong, in the shower, in the bed, etc., but after that first scene, she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene.  Her &quot;acting&quot; is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her TV show.  she at least doesn't seem stoned. There is a plot that involves...just kidding, I have no idea!  There are some actual actors and a Travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies.  The movie only still exists because of Anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make &quot;To the Limit&quot; more than a free rental, if that. I should mention that this is a review for the R rated version.  I don't know if there is an unrated version, but it would have to be better than this.  For more nudity, bad acting, and a less coherent Anna, go rent &quot;Skyscraper&quot;
