I thought I was getting a look into Jay-Z's and Roc-a-fellas world.  Maybe a documentary i thought?  Maybe a movie i thought?  Instead this was the worst attempt at a movie, video whatever they called it EVER.  This thing is horrible.  The only good part is Jay Z rapping the scenarios he is in.  Thats cool for like 2 mins.  At times its like a porn video.  I wanted to get into Jiggas world but all this DVD did was make the world a worse place to live in because of how horrible it is. The crap sets in again over and over all across the plate.  Even the biggest Hova fans should stay away.  Dont buy this
