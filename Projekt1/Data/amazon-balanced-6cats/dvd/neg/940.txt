Why the production team of this movie didn't film in New Orleans is beyond my comprehension. When I first saw this movie, I could see based on the footage that it was filmed in Canada. The terrain is totally different from south Louisiana. It looked like a movie set. I guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake Spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other. It looked like a theme park! The streets looked too clean. For some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old New Orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people's lives but maybe I am being too technical. All the principle characters  all had straight teeth and clear skin. Back in the 1840's just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it. The actor who played Marcel could not act. The actor who played his white father did not age at all for 18 years. Still looked the same, yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years before. The architecture of the plantation house was also wrong. It was'nt even French
No live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern Louisiana.The supporting actors and actresses were quite good.Let me just say this, white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in New Orleans but also other states in the south, the difference is is that in New Orleans, the white master would leave them property and money. Not so in other southern states.The more beautiful the woman, the more she would receive from the white man.The placage system in New Orleans was a business arrangement and it worked for both parties.
