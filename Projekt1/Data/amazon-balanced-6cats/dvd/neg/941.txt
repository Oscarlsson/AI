This thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours.  Characters weren't given clear introductions or motivations, they react in ways that don't make much sense and the accents come, go, and change into new accents altogether.  While the format reminds me of a primetime soap, the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime: which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved
