Bad, bad, bad.
Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing.
I was sort of neutral about DiCaprio until I saw this steaming pile of bad acting. Consequently, since seeing this, I haven't voluntarily watched another DiCaprio performance.
It was a huge mistake by the director (or the screen writer) to NOT set this in the era in which Jim Carroll grew up. Or if it was meant to be, it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms
