Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the "least best" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed
