I have watched this movie along with many other Jet Li films. To be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection. I was so caught up in the title that I really was expecting much more from the film. But I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie takes place in the early eighties. When Gangs dressed in leather with chains, carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally. This was not the type of movie that I was expecting Jet Li to be in. If you want some real action packed Jet Li pick up the Contract Killer which will give you alot more for your money TRUST ME you want be disappointed
