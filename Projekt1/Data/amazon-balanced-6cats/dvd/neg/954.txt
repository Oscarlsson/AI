If the girls in this film were considered "hot" back in 1979 then I'm glad I was still in preschool.

Some unattractive women, not college age girls, but actual 30-year-old women who cannot get into the popular Pi sorority start their own sorority called H.O.T.S. which stands for Help Out The Seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie.

The goal of the H.O.T.S. girls is to steal all the guys away from Pi house, so they throw "wild" parties, jump topless out of a airplane (too bad the camera was on the ground), fly a hot air balloon over the Pi house to launch pies on the Pi girls as they sunbathe topless, etc.  The script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old, which isn't a bad thing.  I liked the fast-paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice.  Unfortunately I didn't find any of the girls even remotely attractive.

If this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with Nikki Ziering, Brittany Daniel, Shannon Elizabeth and Jenna Jameson as the four main H.O.T.S. girls and maybe Catherine Bell as the house mom it would gross over $800 million in DVD sales.

I also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots.  How rude
