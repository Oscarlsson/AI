   When you look at the cover, you think it's about a fantastic trip into a Black Hole, and what they find inside, but it isn't. It's about a Nemo wannabe wanting to enter the Black Hole. I especially did not like the ending. Overall I would rate it:

Story-3 Stars
Actors-4 Stars
Music-4 Stars
Ending-0 Stars
Overall- 2 Stars

 I am not insulting Disney, I think it came out just how "they" wanted it to. And, as with most Disney movies, the only PG part is violence. I liked the actors and the Robots, but other than that, it is a waste of money
