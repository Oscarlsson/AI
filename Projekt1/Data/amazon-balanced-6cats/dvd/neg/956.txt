I collect 1950s era Sci-Fi and I have been replacing my VHS versions with DVDs.  Unfortunately, I need to keep my VHS version for this movie because the print that Image Entertainment made this from was in such poor shape.  The VHS version by UAV Entertainment (The Wade Williams Collection) is MUCH better.  Hopefully, UAV will come out with a DVD version soon
