I agree almost completely with JWALKER019. This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and Gianni S. is  downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes everyone look absurd. Tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good. Angelica is okay but it is not a part for Plowright and I definitely did not like Dunja Vejzovic as the Princess.  It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it was a big  disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica. We should be so lucky to have these performances released on DVD but that is highly unlikely.  I've given this La Scala DVD 2 stars but that is probably being generous
