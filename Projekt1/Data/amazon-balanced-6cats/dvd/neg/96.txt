I don't want to spoil this movie for others and I won't. CACHE is French for HIDDEN and  alot was left hidden. Why does the son suddenly do what he did? Why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she's doing? I didn't care one bit about any of the charactors. This is a slow going movie with no conclusion. If you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry, flip a coin. I watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most US made films. Not this one.
