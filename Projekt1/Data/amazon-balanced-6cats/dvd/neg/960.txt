Wow!  This movie is deeply entrenched on my list of worst movies of all time.  I watched it last night and I woke up in a bad mood.  Everything about it sucked except for the nudity (hence the single star).  I understand it was supposed to be something of a "comedy", but without a touch of reality, I found myself laughing at the movie instead of with it.  The acting is awful, the soundtrack is hideous and the plot is a joke.  Michael Caine's goofy appearance was accentuated with some GINORMOUS glasses... there isn't a teen girl alive who would find that "sexy".  When I saw the 'Blame it on Rio' reviews on this site, I felt the urge to hunt down every person who gave it more than 2 stars (many gave it 5!!), strangle them, then watch as they emptied the contents of their bowels all over the floor.
