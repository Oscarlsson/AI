I was eager to see this movie, having loved the original "American Werewolf" movie; but was sadly disappointed.  I didn't care at all for the characters, the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen.  Mark me off if you don't agree - I know you rude lot will anyway - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it
