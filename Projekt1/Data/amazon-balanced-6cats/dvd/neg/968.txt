I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies, but I was greatly disappointed by this film.  First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections.  There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts.  In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about.  I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film
