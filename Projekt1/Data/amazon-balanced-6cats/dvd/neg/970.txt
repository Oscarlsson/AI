Better than Submerged, but that's not saying much.  My wife and I have seen almost all of Stevies movies and, next to The Foreigner and Submerged, this movie ranks up there in the Horrid category.
What is up with the voice dubbed over when Stevie was mumbling.  We kept trying to guess whose voice that was (Burgess Meredith, The guy who played the other terminator on T2, etc.).  That was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film.
I can't see why Blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe; maybe there are more of us die-hard SS fans than I realized.  Even so, SAVE YOUR MONEY ----DO NOT BUY/RENT/STEAL/VIE
