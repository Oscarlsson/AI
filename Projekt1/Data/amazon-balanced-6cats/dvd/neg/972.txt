First of all, who was the spastic genius who decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five seconds? This is terribly anoying, especially when every third shot is of the same audience members. This may be fun for a home video, but not for a mass marketed commercial release.
The Dance Hall Crashers are an awesome band. Much of the fun of seeing the DHC in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence. It would have been great if this DVD had concentrated on the band as a whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a dizzying rate. 
And since the DHC are supposed to be the focus, why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the audience? It gets on your nerves. 
I love the DHC. Their live CD has a permanent place on my playlist. But this horribly made DVD only made it through three songs. Perhaps if I had been at the front of the stage that night, I would appreciate it more.
