I've seen several pretty funny comedies this year, but none of them could touch what I watched Saturday night. This DVD had it all, slapstick, funny costumes, hilarious sight gags, geeky dancing and more. There were times I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. I just couldn't stop laughing and in fact spent most of the show with tears rolling down my cheeks. It was so funny, that I felt at a couple of points I was going to lose control of my bowels. Yes, it's THAT funny. I highly recommend this one, as it's the closest thing I've seen to the classic Monty Python days of English humor. I don't know when I saw a movie that was non-stop hilarity, without a single moment of serious content. Over two hours of complete madcap behaviour and a near fatal dose of cheese. The name of the DVD? Castles & Dreams, by an English comedy troupe called "Blackmore's Night". These guys are like a combination of Monty Python, Benny Hill and Marty Feldman. My sides are still aching.....
 
Those crazy f&^king Brits....
