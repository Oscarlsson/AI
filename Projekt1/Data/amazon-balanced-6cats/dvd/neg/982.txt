It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's "Foxes".  Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious "Fatal Attraction", "Foxes" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life.  The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused.  The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with.  Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's "On The Radio" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel.  Overall though, "Foxes" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation
