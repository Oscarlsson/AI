I have now seen several Gerry Anderson projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes. #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that would probably rank above Secret Service for me.
