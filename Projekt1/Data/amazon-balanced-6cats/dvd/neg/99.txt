If there is one thing Michael Bay is good at, it's explosions.... big 'ol explosions. There are a lot of them in this film, along with a painful-to-watch romantic scene involving animal crackers. 

This is a film that Ben Affleck & Billy Bob Thornton (both in the film) admit to being ashamed of.

Pure "leave your brain at the door" entertainment.
