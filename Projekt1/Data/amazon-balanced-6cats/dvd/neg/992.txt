Very short game, took about 2 hours to finish it (took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it, because as always their "system is unavailable, please try again later" - took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable, and definately it will be the last steaming product I buy). 

As to the game, you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary. Gameplay was average for a shooter. It seems "episodes" basically translates to "really short game, which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something".
