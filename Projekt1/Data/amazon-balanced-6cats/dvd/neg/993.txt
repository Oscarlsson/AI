Running with Scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event.  Unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful.  It is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling.  

The lead character in the movie is a 15-year old.  His parents divorce, and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly-acquired family.  Lead is on course to become a writer (who eventually writes the non-fiction account upon which this movie is based), but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer.

All the performances were serviceable, save for Gwyneth Paltrow, who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously.  Annette Benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie.  Mrs. Benning performed excellently and selflessly, but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie.  It is a sure sign that Hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term.   Also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies.  The presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters.  Furthermore, the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion, and are put-upon or stifled by the stodgy straights.  The most promising characters are the psychoanalyst's wife and adopted daughter.

The movie has some colorful and funny scenes, but these are not enough to justify a viewing
