After two decades since watching Upstairs Downstairs, I rashly decided to buy the WHOLE set!!!!  As I watched the first episodes I realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me! The melodrama was a bit vulgar and VERY predictable! Later episodes of the set improved, but not by much! It was like watching a biplane that didn't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway. I hope you won't make the same mistake I did
