I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it, thinking it was a film, not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals, you risk being burned at the stake, an act of love to purify your soul. 
This film,as a film, disregarding the topic, is a dog. A cheap "B" grade, blood spurting, flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour, but won't bother
