This is not a good film.  I wanted to like it because I love South Park and I think that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comedic geniuses.  While it shows brief glimpses of some of their future brilliance, overall it's just not very funny.  I think I laughed twice during the whole film.  Watch it to see the South Park guys "before they were stars", but don't expect much
