I tried to rent this DVD from an online service about a week ago. Unfortunately, the DVD was damaged and unplayable, but not in the usual way I've seen before (like a disc cracked all the way through). It looked like someone had turned the playable side face-up and tapped a small nail with a hammer on it. The cracks had that kind of splintery pattern like a broken window. Anyway, I returned the copy and ordered another, which I received today. Again, this one is also unplayable and is cracked in an odd way. I just reported this problem online to the DVD rental company and ordered a replacement copy. However, I let them know that they may want to check their inventory of this DVD as someone may be intentionally destroying the DVDs. If I get another one that is cracked or unplayable in any way, I'm going to just buy a copy because the movie must really have gotten under someone's skin for them to do something like that.
