I totally love this DVD! They really show how to do grooves, not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video. These are grooves you can make  your own and go and dance any where with. That what I think makes this DVD series totally different from the rest. The moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch. It goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! I am hooked on the Groovaloos
