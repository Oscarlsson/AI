I thought that this was Adam Sandler's best movie he has made.That he played man who's a slacker that he trys to impress his girlfriend by adopting a cute 5-year-old boy(played by Dylan & Cole Sprouse).I think of how the movie should've ended real good is for Sonny to have Legal Custody of Jullian.I laugh out loud when I see this movie!!!
