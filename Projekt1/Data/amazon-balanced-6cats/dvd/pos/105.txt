There's not much to say about the reputation of these movies.  There's also little to say about these DVDs, many of which are the high quality special edition collections.

Just do the math.  This is no brainer for people who don't own any of these DVDs.  Even if you only want 8 of them (less than half!), that's about $20.00 a movie (at Amazon's present sales price) and since many of these movies are special editions, that's still a steal!

This is a solid place to start your DVD collection.  Not everyone will enjoy all these movies (after all, they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals), but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings.

One note:  the version of Amadeus here is the reissue and the longer, director's cut of the movie that was not originally released.  Some (including myself) prefer the tighter original release (which can still be gotten at Amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie!)
