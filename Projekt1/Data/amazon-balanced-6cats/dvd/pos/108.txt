this movie is definitely one of the better thrillers to come out since it's release.it's action packed and full of tension in it's 90-minutes of right-on time.kurt russell, always good, does a great job and this is no exception.the late great j.t. walsh,in one of his last performances,plays one of the best bad guys. i can't recommend this film enough for those seeking thrills, action and suspense.i can't really say what is wrong with the film but i just felt that it didn't belong in the perfect category,although maybe it should because it does answer on every call.a movie to watch again and again
