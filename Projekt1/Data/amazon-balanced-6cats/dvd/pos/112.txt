(4.5/5 stars)  Exceptional envisioning of the Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in "Batman Begins;" both are equally effective, though one style over the other will likely appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's "Spider-Man") and molded black rubber suits, though this film also owes much to 1978's "Superman" with its realistic approach and A-list villains. Great stuff.
