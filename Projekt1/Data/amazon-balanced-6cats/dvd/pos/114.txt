I liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times... i like to watch any movie that involves gangs (especially bloods & crips) so i can learn from them...

If you're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies... you may not want this one in your collection... becuase to me, it doesn't show enough Bloods & Crips in it.... the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it as well called The White Fences (Latino/Hispanic gang - i've never heard of this gang, so i don't know if they are true or not.).

The actors who play the gang members of the White Fences are good actors though... i think they are better then Don Cheadle and Wayans who play Crip members... this movie centers more on White Fence and their rivalry w/ Crips... there's not too much focus on Bloods in here... it also more focuses on Sean Penn's character and Robert Duvall too (good cop/bad cop), and Penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the White Fence gang.

Colors is a good watch...i just wish it had more gang focus in it...and more gang sets (chapters, i.e. Eight Tray Gangsters, Hoover, etc...) If you're looking for a good gang buy, buy the book "Monster" by Sanyika Shakur a.k.a. Monster Kody Scott, or "Do Or Die" by Leon Bing. Those 2 books far surpasses this movie..
