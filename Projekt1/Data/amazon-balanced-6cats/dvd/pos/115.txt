This DVD showcases a somewhat new (as of the 2001 recording) sound for Sade, with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music. However, Sade's voice adapts beautifully, and she is one of those singers who just doesn't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous. Her buttery, chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this DVD.

After a few years of owning this DVD, I still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing, sound, and lights on this DVD. I highly recommend it to add to your "chill-out" collection. No longer the jazzy Sade of yesteryear, the versatility of songs on this long (almost 2-hours?) dvd will keep you grooving for hours
