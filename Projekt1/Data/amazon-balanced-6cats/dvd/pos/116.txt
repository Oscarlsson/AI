I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy.

The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story.

The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace.

But still a great movie
