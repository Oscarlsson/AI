The funny thing about this movie is that I read negative reviews here, and rather agree with what they assert: that the plots and some of the characters are not very "evolved" due to time. If you disect the movie, yes this is *true.*

NONETHELESS, I love this movie! I love watching the what the actors DO with this material, and how they manage, with so little time, to invest the viewer in their story. Emma Thompson gives a perfect performance, I think, highlighting how complicated long marriages can become, and the pitfalls of being "too functional." Bill Nighy is hilarious, acting as the needed jolts in between serious moments...quite refreshing.   

Most of all, it is genuinely funny.  Life can feel (or at least my life can feel) disjointed, and I love a movie where a larger pattern emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections.
