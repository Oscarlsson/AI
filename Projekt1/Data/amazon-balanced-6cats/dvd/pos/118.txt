WOW!  I had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful, haunting score to match.  I'm glad our pleas have been heard!  With new High Definition equipment coming down in price, I can't think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema.

Update:  Is this the Region 2 & 4 version that was released overseas?  If so we are in for a real treat!
