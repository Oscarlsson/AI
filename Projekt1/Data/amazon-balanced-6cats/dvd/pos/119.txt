THE STORY OF NASA'S SUCESSFULL FAILURE! ! !

This movie is base on Jim Lovell's book LOST MOON, the title coming from the fact that EVERY other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second. Lovell is the ONLY man to circe it both times he went there! 

What makes this film so realistic is that Dave Scott (7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon)was technicial advisor on the film. I've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released, and watching the film I'd say to myself that this is about the time that XXX happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did!

Look quick at the very end of the movie for the REAL Jim Lovell, he's the Navy Captian with gray hair shaking T. Hanks hand!

see the IMAX version last. Several scenes have been edited out
