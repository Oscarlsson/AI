We all know the movie and story of The Silence Of The Lambs. I reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me, it is one of the best films ever made. Now, with Red Dragon, I give it 4 stars but I think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is.... Anthony Hopkins, the brilliant actor who plays Hannibal Lecter. I don't think this movie would have been as good if Hopkins wouldn't have played the role of Lecter. I own the original Manhunter, which is an older movie and it was good but Hopkins can not be beat for the Hannibal Lecter role. This is a great thriller film!! Edward Norton delivers a very good performance as retired FBI agent Will Graham. When a series of serial killing style murders start, Graham is called out of retirement to help the FBI catch the killer known as "The Tooth Fairy". He eventually seeks the aid of Lecter to help him find who this killer is. Like Silence Of The Lambs, we find Graham visiting Lecter in his maximum security facility. Very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence. This movie holds true to the book with the same name. We get to see Lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in S.O.T.L. Without going further into all the details of the movie, I'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after S.O.T.L. and the movie Hannibal. Also, Ralph Fiennes delivers a good performance as the Red Dragon. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, it's a must see!!!!
