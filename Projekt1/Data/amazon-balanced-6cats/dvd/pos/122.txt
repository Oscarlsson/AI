this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting
