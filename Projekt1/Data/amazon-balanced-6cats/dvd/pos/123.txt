The Brood is the lightning in the bottle that director David Cronenberg has never been able to duplicate. While all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them, The Brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films. It is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread. There is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the lights on because you're very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights.

The film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick. It warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place. This is a very bloody film!

Samantha Eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her. She is being treated by a creepy Oliver Reed (in one of his better performances). Art Hindle is her ex husband and he's worried about how she is treating their young daughter. After a while that is the least of his worries, as these horribly disfigured and (what the Hell are they?) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off Samantha Eggar.

I won't say more, because part of the horror in a Cronenberg film is the pseudo-science that he get you to believe in.

Whereas Cronenberg's Videodrome was weird, but not terribly good, The Brood is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen and a guilty pleasure (can I really call it that?) that I choose to subject myself to every so often.

Really! What ARE those things?
