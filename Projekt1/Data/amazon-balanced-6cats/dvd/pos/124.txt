The overwhelming impression I get from this film is: wow, these guys are alive! They are not just making their way through a boring life, they're out there doing interesting things, doing cool stuff, having adventures & generally living their lives to the fullest. The "they" that I refer to includes just about everybody in the movie, from Paul Pena to the guys travelling with him to Richard Feynman to the Tuvans that Paul meets and befriends.

The documentary gets hazy in spots (I'm still not sure of some of the Tuvan inter-relationships) but does a good job of establishing empathy with Pena, a blind man relying on others in a place far from home. The DVD extras are o.k., the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie. I did not watch the film with the filmmakers commentary turned on; a commentary seems kind of contrary to the purpose of a documentary but I suppose you could get more factual info & technical details on the commentary
