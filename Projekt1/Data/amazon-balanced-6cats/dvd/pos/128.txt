I have been waiting for this DVD to come out for a very long time!  It is a hilarious movie based on a true story about the creation of the Bradley war tank.  It shows how the promotion system in the military used to push for new war products to be used, even if they were not acceptable for use, and the struggle of one man to do the right thing.  You will not stop laughing while watching this movie!
