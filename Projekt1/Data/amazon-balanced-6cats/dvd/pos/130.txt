THIS IS KL'S REVEIW 
  THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE BUT THE PLOT WAS A LITTLE ON THE STRANGE SIDE. MITCHEL MUSSO DID A GREAT JOB, WELL WE ALL KNOW HE ALWAYS DOES A GREAT JOB.OKAY I'LL STOP DROOLING OVER HIM AND GET BACK TO THE MOVIE. 
  THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT A CRANKY OLD MAN THAT DOSN'T LIKE PEOPLE TO SET ONE FOOT ON HIS LAWN,AND A TEENAGE BOY THAT LIVES ACROSS THE STREET THAT DOCUMENTS EVERY TOY THE OLD MAN TAKES BECAUSE IT TOUCHED HIS LAWN,WHAT TIME IT WAS WHEN IT ACCURED, AND TAKES PICTURES.BUT THEN WHEN A TRAGIC INCIDENT HAPPENS TO THE OLD MAN AND EVERY ONE ASUMES HIM DEAD WELL AT LEAST THE BOYS DO. THE TEENAGER DJ AND HIS FRIEND CHOUDER DISCOVER THAT THE HOUSE IS EVEN STRANGER THAN THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE POSSESSED BY THE OLD MAN, WELL THATS WHAT THE BOYS THINK. THEN WHEN A AROGANT GIRL NAMED JENNY SELLING HOLLOWEEN CANDY GOES UP TO THE HOUSE DJ AND CHOUDER  COME TO HER RESCUE AND SHE ENDS UP HELPING THEM FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE HOUSE. THEIR PLAN IS TO PUT OUT THE FIRE OR THE HEART OF THE HOUSE. BUT WHEN THAY FINALLY GET INSIDE OF THE HOUSE THEY DISCOVER A VERY STRANGE THING WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO SAY BECAUSE YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO JUST WATCH IT FOR YOUR SELF.BUT BEFORE THEY GET TO THE HEART, THEY GET UP CHUCKED, LOL.AND THEN A HORRABLE THING COMES TO THEIR MINDS ITS HOLLOWEEN AND EVERY KID THAT GOES TO THAT HOUSE IS GOING TO GET EATEN! BUT I'M GETING TOO CLOSE TO THE  ENDING OR AM I? WELL IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE I'M NOT GIVING ANY MORE OF THE MOVIE AWAY!HOPE YOU LIKE IT AND BY THE WAY MITCHEL MUSSO'S MINE!!!!!
