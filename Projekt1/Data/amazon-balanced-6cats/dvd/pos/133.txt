The perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal (Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Ko Nishimura) are pursued by the illegitamate son (Toshiro Mifune) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes.  This film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic, but the masterful director Akira Kurosawa is not content to let it rest there.  He draws out all the moral complexities of the situation, then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title.  The bad may not always go to prison for their crimes, but do they really "sleep well?
