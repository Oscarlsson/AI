I am a dancer. I found the choreography in this movie beautiful, brillient and different. The emotion in it really touched me, and I had actually fallen out of dancing because of many different reasons and this movie really did bring me back to my love of dance. It's very rare to find dance movie that will offer quite as much as this movie did. Not to mention I absolutly adore George De La Pena. Awsome dancer and he was my favorite character in the movie. I love the fact that every character has something they are working through, no one is exactly perfect. To me, although the acting may not be what every one would call oscar quality, to me, it shows a glimps in to life. How pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some times difficult to get through. This movie, to me is well worth the watch. Sorry for the ramble.
