I was sooooooooo excited to see that this movie had been released, and I was not disappointed.  The dancing was magnificent, and it was amazing to see Patrick & Lisa together.
I have to saythought for many....it was disheartening to see you perform with your wife, Patrick, because so many of us have fantasized of that same possibility!
I would recommend it to ALL who love dance!  It is a beautiful tribute to what a person CAN do!
