This is an essential collection for every Al Pacino fan. In Carlitos Way and Scarface he does one of his best work ever. Then there is the performance that gave him his only Oscar so far in A Scent of a Woman. If  you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the  Al Pacino collection
