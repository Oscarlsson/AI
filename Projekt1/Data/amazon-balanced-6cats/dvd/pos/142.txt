I loved the first one and I think, with the logic and plot of the first one, this follows through. We knew they changed the world, and in this sequel we see that. The actors do a good, since the lead characters are suppose to be, let's say less intelligent, but nice. I think this movie and the 1st one are classics. I like the grim reaper, his atitude during the movie, and the fact the he is the comic relief (okay so most of the movie is comic relief) Even if they are fun to watch to laugh at, it is worth it to watch
