This movie is high in my top 10 off all times list, and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie I can think of. I watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw it first more than 10 years ago. My 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well. Great performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon. Probably Ron Howard best film ever
