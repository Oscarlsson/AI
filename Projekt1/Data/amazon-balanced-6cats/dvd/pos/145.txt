It's strange; this just came on FX, and once it was on, I was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing, even though I've already seen it (in the theatres during its initial release run), and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around. 

Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with "Lady In The Water" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like "Hostel" and those damned "Saw" movies (enough, already)! 

At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like "The Exorcist" - if that's what you want, buy and watch "The Exorcist". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time
