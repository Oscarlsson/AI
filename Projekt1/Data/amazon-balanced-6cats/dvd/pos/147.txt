If you liked "Raise the Red Lantern" or "The Last Emperor",this is a perfect movie.Gong Li,who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband.

"Farewell My Concubine" uses Chinese opera as a way of telling the story.I used to listen to a lot of Chinese opera--which is an acquired taste.This movie uses the story of a king&his beloved concubine's self-sacrifice to frame the love story between two men.When one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman,the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.The final scenes are chilling,powerful.This is a spectacle not to be missed
