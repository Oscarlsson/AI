Let me preface this review by stating that if I had to do this 90-minute workout in its entirety I'd probably never reach for it -- it's just too long. But in its dvd format Karen Voight has thoughtfully provided a menu that has made this otherwise excellent program usable and doable. It's set up so that you can follow it in logical sections and, best of all, you can completely skip the squat sequence and just do the amazingly thorough floor workout, which is terrific for those like me who suffer from knee problems which prevent us from performing squats and lunges.

I am able to successfully break this whole program down into *warmup/arms/abs/cooldown-stretch* Mondays and Thursdays, and *warmup/floor legs/cooldown-stretch* on Tuesdays and Fridays, and each intense workout is about 45 minutes.

Music and clothing - especially the men's outfits! - are dated but I can get over it (though I'm sure there are others who cannot). Broken into shorter segments, I rate this 4.5 stars which I round up to 5.
