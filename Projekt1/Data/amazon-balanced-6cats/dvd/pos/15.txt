I was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch Live 8 and certainly regretted that. However, I was fortunate enough to find this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and more. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances. I would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation--truly a "must have" for anyone's collection!
