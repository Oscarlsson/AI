DVD #1 presents a terrific hour-long history of the franchise.  It hits both the high- and lowpoints, and indicates why the Packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in NFL history.  Lambeau, Hutson, Lombardi, Starr, Nitschke, the Ice Bowl, Favre, White, the nine NFL championships, the three Super Bowls they won (I, II, and XXXI), and the one they lost (XXXII).  The best fans in the league, the smallest venue, the most legendary stadium, and the team's miraculous survival over 80+ years, in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans.  The highpoint, of course, is the 15-minute section entitled "Lombardi" which encapsulates the Green Bay career of the NFL's greatest coach--but at the end of this DVD about the Packers' heroic ongoing history, you realize that as great as Lombardi was, the team is greater still.

DVD #2 was produced earlier in VHS format (I bought it at the Packer Pro Shop in GB) and portrays the greatest game in Packers history and one of the greatest in NFL history. Other reviewers have justly praised its play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the participants.  Yes, Kramer was offside--but luck is a part of any game, and the Cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter.  Like another reviewer, I love the postgame interviews, even the glimpses of Green Bay in 1967.  The muted colors of the frigid game (maybe Packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s--I see the same thing in footage of other games) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed.
