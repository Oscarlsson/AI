Excellent little known movie with Viggo Mortensen as an F.B.I.
agent under deep cover to infiltrate Japenese Mob. Great
performances by all {Michael Nouri, a little over the top}
great action and sentimentality when Viggos character is torn
between man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent after
F.B.I makes deal with mobster Nouri to make a hit on the Yakuza
