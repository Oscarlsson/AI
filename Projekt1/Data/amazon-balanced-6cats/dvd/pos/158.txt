At first I was skeptical about buying an aging McCartney band tour dvd, even though I have every one, so I bought it. I watched it from start to finish. UNBELIEVABLY SUPERB. The lighting, the energy of the band and the crowd, suprising interviews!! and ole Paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark! After watching it I felt like I had been there. It is the best one I have seen yet! If you like McCartney, this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear!
Excellent buy
