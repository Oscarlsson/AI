I thought the first Ice Age was great.  This one is good, not great.  They really used scrat better this time than before, but the rest of the characters were.....not undeveloped, but it just didn't have as many hilarious situations.  Sid is as hilarious as ever, but manny and diego doen't do as much.  

ITs a good, fun movie, but its not as good as the first one, rent it though, it does have some hilarious scenes
