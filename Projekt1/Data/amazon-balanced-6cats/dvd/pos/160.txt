Eraserhead is filled with strange, uncanny scenes.  What is it to be uncanny? Dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis; beyond the ordinary or normal; mysterious; arousing superstitious fear or dread; uncomfortably strange.  I would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time. One has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere.  

The movie does not have a linear, logical storyline.  It is a mood piece, for want of a better term.  A visual poem, which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen.  If you let your mind play among these images, it will begin to invent meaning for itself.  You may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it.

The cinematography is stunning, not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term, but arresting: you simply cannot turn your head away.

Will you like it?  Well, I think this is one of those movies you either love or hate.  Think of it as a Rorshach -- how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are
