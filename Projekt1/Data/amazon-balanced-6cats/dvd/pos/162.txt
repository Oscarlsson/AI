Eric Stoltz give's a kick ass performance here!!

How 80's is this movie??..VERY.. which is why it rule's!!

Gotta love Elias Kotes as a skinhead punk!! he look's a bit like Henry Rollins back in the day!!

I like the storyline a lot as well...thing is though I dont know why he decided to go for his more friend of a girl as oppossed to Tomlin's charachter..maybe because he knew her better!

This a real good view into the 80's!!

SEE IT TODAY!!!
