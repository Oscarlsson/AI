Believe the good reviews written here about this film. I havent cared much thus far for the movies Penn has directed after this one, I suppose its because I feel this is such a great film, he created a tough act to follow, but even if he never does top it, he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time. I like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into, and this is one of those. Although, I would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit, as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas. But overall this is a great movie, with great performances by all, and it packs an after-punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over. Im not easily touched by most movies, but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits.  Its without a doubt one of my favorite films. This is the kind of film that reminds you, movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art
