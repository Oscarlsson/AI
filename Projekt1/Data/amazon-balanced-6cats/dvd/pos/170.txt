"All men can do anything, if they will" seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture, carefully directed by Agnieszka Holland, one of the major female directors in the world.

This absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters. 

On one hand, our little girl will know the world is not turning around her; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true, and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life.

A triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the Nineties.
