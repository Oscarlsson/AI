This box set is worth every penny! 

This is an absolute MUST have if you meet the following eligibility requirements: 

1. You have a decent TV (at least 32") and are able to watch in the dark 

2. You have surround/stereo sound 

3. You love 3D!!!!!!

I bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately I made a BIG mistake. I bought the "Horror" collection- which works- except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch. 

Then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this set recently (Encounter, Alien Adventure, Haunted Castle) and I was simply blown away. 

Now I can not stop watching these 3D movies!! 

The movies are all made by NWAVE pictures- and boy- have they done a fantastic job!!!! 

Informative, fun, and of the highest quality.....this is THE DEFINITIVE 3D package. Kids will love, and so will adults. 

Also, once you have the LCD shutter glasses, they will work on any "field sequential" 3d movie you can get your hands on. 

These movies are thrilling though- especially the non-stop coaster rides in each one. 

Do you hear what I am saying?? BUY THIS......NOW!!

You can thank me later!!! 100 stars if I could and of course..HIGHLY RECCOMENDED
