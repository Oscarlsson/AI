Argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by Lumiere. After Hitchcock and Ray, Leone and Fuller, Argento is the last true auteur to make genre films. Visually, a film like Profondo Rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed, objects and people alike, take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film. Argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker. Cinema is not an answer but a question and Argento is the answer to Eisenstein's theory of film as violence, violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them. A murder, a painting, a mother, a son, a mirror, all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing, the mystery of cinema, the questions, are resolved.
