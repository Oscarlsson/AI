Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances
