I was thrilled to find this set here on Amazon, and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly. All of the DVD's have some good interviews with the producers, designers, voice actors, and other people associated with the show.  I don't usually like watching interviews/things where people talk a lot, but I love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was. I totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different
