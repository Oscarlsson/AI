WOW! What more can I say! Just watching this was an absolutely extraordinary experience. This is a "behind the scenes" look at photography. It gets you up close and personal with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in trying to capture the "shot of a lifetime". I own many National Geographic books, but you won't be able to appreciate what goes into each photograph without watching this DVD. Even those who are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate it
