I was so pleased to find this movie on Amazon.com. I had watched it as a child and pinned over it when I could not find it in stores over the years. This is such a pure love story, with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real. There are too few unpretentious, untampered romantic movies around these days. Most reveal too much- literally. But this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre
