Somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and I am sure if Ben and Matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime.  However - it just may be one of
those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible
to re-capture, and in a sense, haunting.  I am not obsessive in
any way but I have watched this movie at least twenty times -
with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where I sometimes go for comfort.  

The synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a
great story most definitely puts this movie in a special
category - so buy it and watch it.  You'll be glad you did.
