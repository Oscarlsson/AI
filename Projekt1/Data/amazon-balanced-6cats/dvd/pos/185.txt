Phantom Quest Corp. an action/comedy film about the drunken, karoake singing,party girl Ayaka and her friends taking on paranormal enemies, from Dracula to a possessed surgeon, mummies, and even magical monks. This Movie is a comedic romp through the world of supernatural events.

The only set backs on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little annoying after hearing them too many times, the series is too short although it was still good. The video quality was also pretty nice, and subtitles were understandable and on que. The plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks, but more action and laughs. 

All in all this film is a great buy and worth the money spent. A great addition to any anime collection.
