Most people that like Wes Anderson's films are rabid fanatics, and I'm no exception, so when the chance came to buy his first feature-length film for $7, I snapped it up. If you enjoyed Life Aquatic or The Royal Tenenbaums, you'll enjoy this, on some levels, too. Many of Anderson's classy touches are already in evidence in this film. The story is fun, and the characters are well-developed. Yeah, pretty much buy it if you like the Wilson brothers or Wes Anderson. The high point of the movie is certainly Luke Wilson's character, masterfully done even in his first role.
