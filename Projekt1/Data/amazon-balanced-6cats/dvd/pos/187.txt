Fraser's film is truly a winner in production quality.   His attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil.  Despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film; eye-candy performers, lighting, fantastic musical score, and riske scenes, this film has visually appealing sequences.  If anyone is interested in film and theatrical production, I would highly recommend the director's commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process.  From the commentary, it seems that Fraser will never be finished with this film: a mentale that I admire in an artist.  Art is a process and is never perfect.  

This is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film.   Getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future.  This film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people.   

I did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however.   Though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide, I feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs.  I had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as "Selfish gay guy ruins a marriage". (On the other hand, Cherilee Taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script; she wasn't quite the victim her character ultimately could have become.)  By the end of the film, I was wondering how Violet was making it as a once again as single woman.  From an audience's standpoint, we didn't really see that.  David and Kryla make up, Matt goes to illustration school, but what happens to Violet?   

Overall, I would highly recommend this film.  With such a great interpretation on the screen, it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres.
