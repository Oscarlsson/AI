CSI:Miami, having evolved with some pains over the first three seasons, dips in quality in Season 4 after a very solid 3rd Season. Anyone who has watched the show realizes that Horatio, unlike Gil Grissom or Mac Taylor, is the true star of the show. The rest of the CSIs are entertaining, but the show is truly about him. This dynamic, when combined with the glamour and glitz of the Miami setting and crimes most foul, make this an entertaining CSI and reportedly the most watched show in the world.

Plotwise, season 4 gets too involved in personal character arcs to the detriment of the enjoyable crimes and mysteries. Horatio has a bizarre relationship and marriage with Delco's sister, a mole infiltrates CSI Miami, and the Mala Noche gang picks a fight that carries over into the fifth season and causes a death to someone close to Caine. These arcs were handled poorly, especially the storyline of the Mole, which when revealed was utterly anti-climactic, especially considering the Mole will be a series regular in Season 5.

Emily Proctor and Rex Linn continue to shine as Calleigh and Detective Frank Tripp. Adam Rodriguez has a sleepwalking performance as Delco, and Johnathan Togo as Ryan Wolfe does little to distinguish himself from Gregg Sanders on the Vegas cast. David Caruso contines his acting by mannerisms technique, perfecting the hands on hip move, the put on sunglasses technique, and the dramatic pauses every four syllables style that has made him the great scene chewing overactor of the year. Watching Caruso is a drinking game's worth of entertainment.

The extras of Season 4 are a bit pedestrian, with some audio commentaries, and three featurettes covering show production from shooting to post-production. If you are a fan of the show you will pre-order this one, those who don't like this CSI will be happy to know that Vegas and NYC come out within 30 days of this release.
