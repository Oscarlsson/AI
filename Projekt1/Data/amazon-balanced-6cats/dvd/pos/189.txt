'Big Trouble' has a lot of big things going for it...big laughs, big plot, big cast...and because of all this it loses a peg or two...for there's just sooooo much for it to keep up with itself...you get somewhat lost in the jumble.  The film stars Tim Allen in the central role, if you could call it that, as a journalist who gets himself and his son (Foster) thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals (Sizemore & Knocksville) a hitman (Farina) a wealthy jerk-off of a man (Tucci), the mans wife (Russo) her daughter (Zooey) a homeless man that resembles Jesus (Lee in a histerical role) some mobsters, dimwitt cops (Garofalo & Warburton), FBI agents with attitude (Heavy-D & Epps) and a toad that sprays hallucinogenic saliva.  See all that and I haven't even got to the plot, but it's one of those things you'd have to see to really understand.  Lets just say everyone has a different agenda and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda changes to be someone elses entirly.  Does that sum it up?  It's funny, real funny, but it's also tightly woven without much room to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace, keeping you watching closly to understand all that's going on.  It'll mae sense in the end though, I promise
