I LOVED "Never Cry Wolf"!!!  I saw it years ago on video, but can only imagine the DVD is as good or better.  I was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'The Bear' to buy together....  I love Anthony Hopkins, and the Bear was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.  Don't let the pairing with 'The Bear' scare you off.  "Never Cry Wolf" is excellent!
Sorry Tony :-)  Okay, I just realized that 'The Edge' was the one with Anthony Hopkins... my apologies to the Bear!   Anyway, get "Never Cry Wolf"!  You won't be disappointed!!
