This is without a doubt, one of Harrison Fords greatest moments. An incredible film with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. Very dramatic with a lot of suspense. A very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view. A film you will want to see again and again. Action, mystery, drama, thriller. There are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such, but they don't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama. I highly recommend it
