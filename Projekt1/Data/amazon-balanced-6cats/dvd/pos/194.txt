I loved this  DVd set! Grew up watching it..and remember running home after school to catch each days episodes. Watching this  set transported me back to another time, when things were peaceful and less frazzeled! Stayed up till 2 am watching it all and felt like that little kid from school again! Like many young girls back then I was 'in love' with Tim Considine! So nice to see he and David back talking about it! I hope Disney Co. will put out the next 2 series of this great show on DVD soon
