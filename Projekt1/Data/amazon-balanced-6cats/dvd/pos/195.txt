After being into the "techno" scene since my first party in 1993, this is one of the best videos I have seen describing the DJ feelings. You really get a feel for how a DJ thinks. If you at all interested in the DJ lifestyle or are interested in DJing this is a must have. It have great insights in the minds of some of the best DJs around. Plus Nigel Richards does a great job with the "How to DJ" part. Not only is this for the "newbies" but for those who have been around a bit. Plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms. WOW that sounded like an infomercial
