I followed Texhnolyze through it's fansubs, waited patiently for each DVD to come out.
You don't have to sit and ponder, look hard and deep to find a meaning in Texhnolyze.  It hits you right in the face from the beginning.
There are some people out there that society likes to forget.  Likes to shove to the backburners and ignore.  In this tale, they are a whole race of people - the people of the underground city of Lux.
And even within them, sides are chosen.  You're either in or your out.  Ichise is one of these outcasts and he lives by what he knows.  The only thing he knows - his strength, his brute force.
This point is particularly brought out in one of the last episodes, when Ichise makes the decision to protect Ran.  He's come to feel something for the girl and, perhaps, in a way she reminds him of the mother he could never save.  So he goes to offer the only thing he's sure of having - his body.  That's always been his bargaining chip, always been what everyone wanted.
Anger, rage and fighting.  Though are all Ichise knows.  How do you expect him to act any less animalistic than the animal this society made him become?  It's clear through most of the show that he doesn't know how to react to people.
Likewise, it's the same old sort of theme out of many a popular sci-fi movie - man bringing about an end to his own world.  Ichise inadvertantly is thrust into all of this by his texhnolyze, Ran is thrust by her visions and everyone else by some intricate connection.  But eventually, Lux collapses because of technology, the classic warning given in so many Apocalypse movies.

Not each episode requires such in-depth searches for meaning.  It all fits into the grandier scheme and message of the series itself.  This series, as a whole, is a very good series.  It does require connecting together pieces and keeping larger themes in mind, as well as a little psychology but what good series /doesn't/
