I am saying this as an Italian American myself.. Quit bashing the show because it portrays are small portion of Italian Americans.. Its a TV show and a darn good one..It does not portray us all like that...just this mob family..so quit being so sensitive and lighten up Frances...and PS..I do not care if this was help or not either!
