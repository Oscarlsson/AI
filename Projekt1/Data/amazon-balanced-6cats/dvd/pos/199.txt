I finally found out this was out on DVD after having the VHS version for many years.  The DVD edit is very close to the VHS version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act, plus some video strobing added during Cindy Lauper's run down the runway, which I'm not sure was really needed, but I'm ok with it, although the video strobing was done again later, which seems to me as a cheap effect, that really doesn't add to the performance.

I think Brian Adams and Cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid.  I thought originally sinaed (sp? whatever) was a strange choice at the time, maybe good for the part, but after seeing the documentary, I see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end.  She's too instable, and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event, nor did she show any respect for the part.  Speaking of which, all of those artists that were called to perform at this event, and didn't say Yes on the first call.... shame on you.  If Roger calls you for an event, you say YES, and put whatever you're doing aside, because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with.

I wish there were more documentary material with this DVD, as this was such a big event, there should have been more information.  I had heard in an interview before the show that Roger was once asked if he'd ever do the wall again, and he basically said "If the berlin wall would ever come down, then I would consider doing it again", and this was never mentioned in the Doc.

Buy the video, even if you have the VHS, you'll enjoy it.

... Still waiting for Pulse to be released as well, enjoy!
