I covered a similar theme in my international relations MA - whilst any programme made for TV has to be reasonable breif on the subject, I found this to be a very well argued and produced programme.

I recomend it, not so much as some dark conspiracy, but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country. We should question to make sure that what happens in our name, is always in our interest
