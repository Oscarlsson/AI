In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope.

The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs.

The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks.

Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons. 

If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo" and young "Kristie." Just amazing.
