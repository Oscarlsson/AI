I normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies, so I was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'Living in Oblivion'.  The reason I took the chance at all was due to the presence of Catherine Keener, one of our most overlooked and under-appreciated Hollywood actresses.  She once again did not disappoint, but the entire cast was extremely good.  You get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film.  Buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director.  The Amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason.  I'm glad to join my fellow Amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem
