This dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of Christianity; it discusses an alternate viewpoint (as Dan Brown reminds us "the winners write the history books")This dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with; esp. the idea of God as male, and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership. This dvd includes interviews with Dan Burstein, Henry Lincoln, Martin Lunn, Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince, Dr. Karen Ralls, Dr. James Robinson, and Margaret Starbird. I particularly liked Margaret Starbird's interviews - she describes how when she first read "Holy Blood, Holy Grail", she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal Catholic. But afterward, she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research Mary Magdalene and write "The Woman with the Alabaster Jar". She comes across as very rational, sensible and even heroic. It takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority. I thought Dan Burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of Jewish people during the time Jesus lived. I think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that doesn't mean it is necessarily the truth. To be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live
