Attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day. It features a stellar cast including Powers Boothe as a crafty Roman leader who tries to use Attila to gain possession of Rome.

Gerard Butler is Attila, the Hun,and he is everything about Attila in this role, never was an actor better suited. His character is sharp, passionate, determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film. He brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with Boothe even more dynamic.

This is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes
