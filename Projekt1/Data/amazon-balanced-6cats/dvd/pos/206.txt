I saw this movie for one reason: I wanted to see Gerard Butler in something other than Phantom Of The Opera just to see how he played a "normal" role. I've never been a big fan of "chick flicks" (for instance, my friend and I watched A Walk To Remember awhile ago, and the only thing that kept us from laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by one of the girls in the room). That said, Dear Frankie is a thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored. Initially I had trouble understanding what the actors were saying (they all have thick accents), but once I got used to it I had no problems through the rest of the movie
