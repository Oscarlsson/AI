This is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning.  One does not need to love the results of these changes (I personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it, even as I marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election) to appreciate how Clinton's 1992 campaign, as seen in this film, changed the American political world. 

"War Room" should be seen along with more recent documentaries (like, for example, "Staffers '04") to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal (to be elected rather than to govern).  Hopefully, it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless, mind-numbing, dumbing down assessments of candidate traits (like "character" or "integrity") we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years
