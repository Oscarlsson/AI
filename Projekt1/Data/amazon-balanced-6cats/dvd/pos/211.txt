This original version is much funnier than U.S. version. The humor is dry and intelligent, and the characters are very complex: at times, you feel sorry for them; other times, you love them and laugh with them; and mostly, you think they're idiots. What a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience. 

It's not often I can watch a DVD or series over and over, but this is one that I've enjoyed each time
