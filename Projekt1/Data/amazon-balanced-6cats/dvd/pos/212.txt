We started with "There Goes a Dump Truck" which actually features a different "Dave."  This first Dave was in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the other Dave.  I don't think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both. 
Anyway, I started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the TV.  I don't let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall TV to things that are at least somewhat informative/educational.  As a result, he was never one to sit and watch much TV (made it hard for me to get things done!).  But, with this series, he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles (and some of the more goofy moments) so much.   It really was a lifesaver at times.  Needless to say it didn't take long for me to collect the entire series.  I have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations.  My in-laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the "Tractor" and "Farm Truck" versions with him. 
His favorites include "There goes a Firetruck," "There goes a Monster Truck" and "There goes a Spaceship."  But, he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus!  
I can't say enough good things about the video series as far as my son's enjoyment goes.  Just don't look for any oscars for the acting and editing.  It's pretty choppy, even for an amateur eye. 
I would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle.
