Having visited St. Petersburg, Russia a year ago, I could not pass up the chance to watch this movie.  I must say, it was nicely done.  I can relate to the obnoxious, business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip.  I was more like the care-free younger brother, but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed.  The scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although I wish there were more because the city is full of beauty.  And this goes for the women as well!!  I mainly went to see the city...but I also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that I planned would be my travel companion.  What I didn't expect was to really fall in love :-).  The BIG reason why I confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to American women...as if explained in the additional extras on the DVD...but the Russian lady that I met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking!!  One thing I should add though.  The movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself.  Such is not the case.  It takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months, but it is more like a year.  It is time consuming to get her a US visa.  But she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover, the wait is worthwhile.  Another word of caution:  Prepare yourself to fall in love with Russia...the people are very nice and I know of a lot of Americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now
