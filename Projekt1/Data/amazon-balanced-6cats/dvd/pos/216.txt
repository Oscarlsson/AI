I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to bike? Think about it. 

If there are no rules against it, this film should be renominated for Oscar.
