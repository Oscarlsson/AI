This DVD gives a very good 60 minute workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation.

I think the toning section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises. It's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes. I use 3 pound weights at this point and I can see where in the future I might be buying 4 pound weights. 

Minna is a great instructor. She has excellent cueing and is very encouraging. She is never annoying. I also have her Optimizer- Balanced Blend DVD and I love that one.
