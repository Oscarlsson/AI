When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a whole movement.  This film, including  interviews taken when Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips  from media, film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats  up to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs.  With a large assembly of  other beat writers and the poets they influenced (Carroll and Bukowski), it  is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement.  It is interesting to  see the Beat propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media  treated the sense of a &quot;cool&quot; movement; they painted a false  portrait.  This film is for lovers of Beat or people genuinely interested.   However, if you do not like documentaries, you won't like this one.  Also,  I was disappointed to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces  of work when the actual writers could have performed it.  Honestly, I  skipped these parts.  I wanted to see Ginsburg doing &quot;Howl.&quot;   Another disappointment is the DVD version, which was slapped together on  the fly.  I envisioned additional clips and useful information (let's face  it, you can put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names  credited for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not exciting).   However, with all disappointments aside, this film is good for a few  viewings.  It conveys a better picture of the Beats than other films have  before and enjoyed alot of the material
