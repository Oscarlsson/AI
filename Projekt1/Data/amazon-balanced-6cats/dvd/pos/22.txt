Back in the 1980s, back before every television show was "CSI: City Of Your Choice" and "Law & Order: Crime Division of Your Choice," there was a veritable plethora of well-written, clever, hour-long mystery programmes - "Magnum P.I.," "Murder, She Wrote," "Moonlighting," "Hart to Hart," "The A-Team," to name just a few.  And this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from (not counting PBS).  But far and away, the best of these mystery shows (and perhaps the most under-rated) was "Remington Steele," in which Pierce Brosnan (with second billing!) and Stephanie Zimbalist fought crime with style, dash, wit, comedy, and a bit of romance.  The series, with its rat-a-tat dialogue, vaguely Deco feel (a slight Deco revival was the only good thing about `80s dï¿½cor), and occasional zaniness, at times harkens back to the wonderful Preston Sturges-esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and `40s.  Indeed, it's clear from the moment that Brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of Classic Hollywood, but he was a Cary Grant for our times; devastatingly handsome in dapper Saville Row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as Grant's.  (As an aside, it's also clear that Brosnan was born to play James Bond - truly, who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor, albeit belatedly?  We won't get into the infamous Season Five vs. Bond debacle.) 

In the entertainment field, there are actors-with-a-lowercase-"a" (pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays), Actors-with-a-capital-"A" (truly impressive sorts, such as Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, and Anthony Hopkins), and then there are Stars.  Brosnan is clearly the lattermost, bright and luminous.  Zimbalist, as sleuth Laura Holt, is spunky, and makes a valiant attempt to be Rosalind Russell to Brosnan's Grant, but, somehow, she falls slightly flat.  Nevertheless, there's no denying the chemistry between the two, which is what really "makes" the show.  (This is particularly remarkable considering that the two notoriously didn't get along whilst filming the series.)

References to Classic Hollywood are constant, and amusing - Remington Steele, the (sort of) reformed con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of film, and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film.  ("Joseph Cotton, Orson Wells, `The Third Man,' British Lion Film Corporation, 1949." is a particular favorite throughout the run of the series, as are Cary Grant films and, ironically, the occasional Bond reference.)  The show was scored by the wonderful Henry Mancini, he of "Charade" (A Grant reference, yet again!), "The Pink Panther," and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" fame (among many others), which of course, adds to the caper/romantic feel of the show.  (By the way, I'll take the somewhat chaste clinches of Remington and Laura over the sordidness of "Sex and the City" to daydream about any day of the week!)

I'm so pleased that Remington Steele has been released on DVD.  I was seven years old when it debuted, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time (I was a sophisticated child).  But I hadn't seen it since, and once again, have found myself charmed by each and every episode.  For those who are too young to remember the series, check it out - it's much more worthwhile than anything on the air now, and for those of you who *do* remember it, revisit.  It's worth your time and money.
