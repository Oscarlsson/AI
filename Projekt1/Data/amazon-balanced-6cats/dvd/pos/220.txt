Hello, fellow "Amazon'ers" out there in cyber-land :)

I grew up in the MI TV series era.  As a TV/DVD collector of primarily 60's-80's series and member of a couple of TV/DVD forums on the 'net, I can mention to all of the "Amazon'ers" out there that this is a gem that we've been wanting on DVD for years.  As for some of the "Cruise" posts, I saw the 1st MI film and, as others mentioned here, it's somewhat like comparing "apples and oranges".  From a TV/DVD collectors point of view, we want the (TV-series remake) films released, since in a lot of cases, the studios will release the original TV/DVD series as a market "tie-in" coinciding with the film release.  TV/DVD collectors may not purchase the film on DVD but in a lot of cases, the film "gets the job done" for the TV series release.  My favorite season of this series was S1.  I liked Steven Hill in the IMF Force Team Leader role just a little better than Peter Graves although I thought Graves did an outstanding job in the role after Hill left the series.  I also liked the original script line of  "Please dispose of this recording in the usual manner".  :)  What can we say about the "Landau/Bain" team on this show?  Classic!  And, what a casting jackpot for Greg Morris in the "tech/electronics genius" role :)

This series is a must-buy for most of the TV/DVD collectors out there.  It's simply-put, a "sure thing" gem for your collection.  I only hope that additional seasons will make it to their release[s].  As the saying goes, "It's all about the #'s" (sales #'s).  Hopefully, this set will sell well on the 'net stores and your local outlets.
