I lived through the vietnam era.  IF you did you can't ever forget.  This guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us.  Here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can learn to KEEP FROM REPEATING IT.  

For me, here was the most unforgettable moment.  Decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days.  Macnamara tells him we--the americans--were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism, seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china.  The north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said, "Mr. Macnamara, you must have never read a history book!  We've been FIGHTING the chinese for a thousand years!  We aren't their puppet!  We were fighting for our national freedom!  We would have fought to the last man!"  Macnamara says they almost came to blows.

Here's the point.  Macnamara says, as compared to say the soviets, we didn't understand the north vietnamese.  We didn't really know enought about them.  We had no idea what was in their minds.  And that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons!  That's why we lost!

Does any of this sound familiar??????  

This is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age.  It's that good and that informative.  Of course, it won't be widely viewed by the american public.  We'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things--like sporting events
