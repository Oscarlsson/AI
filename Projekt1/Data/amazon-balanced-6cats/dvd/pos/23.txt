...But I'm giving season four 4 stars, because there aren't any subtitles in this set. They also didn't have subtitles for season 3, but they did had subtitles for seasons 1 & 2. Strange, huh? However, the quality of the DVDs are fine and the episodes, of course, are wonderful to watch. At the end of this season the Meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good, but he decides to stay with the Bunkers a little longer, so he can get his Masters degree. 

  There aren't any special features or anything in this DVD set, but as long as the episodes are uncut, I'm happy. If you're a fan of the show, this DVD set is a MUST-HAVE!
