My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie.  I actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car when while traveling.  My husband and I originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can share it with our own kids now.  If you love animals, this movie is for you.  The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to make and I believe it.  It's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other.  This has got to be one of the best animal films out there.
