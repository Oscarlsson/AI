Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo
