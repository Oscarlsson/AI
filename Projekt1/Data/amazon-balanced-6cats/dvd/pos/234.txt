Based on the bestselling novels by Michael and Jeff Shaara, "Gods and Generals" and "Gettysburg" (based on the elder Shaara's "The Killer Angels") are the most excting and emotional Civil War epics ever filmed. The battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic Civil War battle sequences ever put on screen. The acting is phenomenal, with the likes of Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Tom Berenger, Robert Duvall, Bruce Boxleitner, Martin Sheen, Richard Jordan, Sam Elliott and Mira Sorvino, but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in these two movies. Director Ronald F. Maxwell has created a masterpiece with his first two films, giving rise to the hope that the last film, "The Last Full Measure," will complete what will hopefully be the best Civil War trilogy ever made!
