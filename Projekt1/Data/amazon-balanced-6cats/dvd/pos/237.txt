I really like this DVD - you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes.  Lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises, and she moves quickly from one exercise to another.  I like the variety of exercises - there are not too many rep's on any one exercise, which keeps the workout from being monotonous.  

This is the first "programmable" exercise DVD I've used, and I like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order - this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start (and once I start, I'm fine)
