I am a faithful CSI watcher, and have been since the shows inception.
I buy the DVD sets and enjoy them tremendously.  However, there are
two trends I see developing that I don't care for---one, there is
too much Catherine.  We know everything about her kid, her dead
husband, her crook father, etc., and she's really an annoying character.  
She makes nasty comments about everyone; she's always being insubordinate;
she goes out with men half her age (let's quit trying to make
her seem like a young chick when she isn't, especially wearing those
skin tight jeans), she is very arrogant, and even though she continually
screws up (loses her camera; blows up the lab in a previous season,
accuses people before she has all the evidence), they made her a
supervisor.  Also, the plot line with Grissom and Sara, while 
predictable, is not the greatest.  I think Grissom would be 
better off paired with Lady Heather.  There's an idea!  Let's see more
of Lady Heather.  Still, even with the annoying overabundance of the 
least likable character (Catherine), the show is one of the best, if not 
THE best, on TV (up there with Without a Trace, NCIS and Numbers).  Keep 'em coming
