We have the kind of family where we promised that all ex's and all family children, blood related or not, would be family.  People think I'm strange because my friendship with my husband's ex and her family is so important to me.  She was visiting us and our granddaughter in Ontario, CAN, she lives in L.A. and she wakens to classical music every morning.  I decided to put on Concert for George, which always brings me to tears, but she never took her eyes off of the screen.  She especially enjoyed Ravi Shankar and his daughter's opening to the concert and educated us on what the music meant.  As I told my husband...no person I have shared this DVD with has ever left it with a 'so what' opinion.  They all loved it and I think, most of my friends have it by now, Beatle lovers or not.  Thanks to all who made this a tribute to George, but also a way to educate people about his talents, his many, many friends, his loving wife and son, all of whom, obviously adored George and his music, as do I....and my close friend Mary
