The Freshman is a very funny movie.  The central joke is that Marlon Brando plays a godfather type figure in lower Manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character Brando so famously portrayed.    Matthew Broderick is the freshman, an innocent NYU film student, who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with Brando and his "family".  The funniest scenes involve a  Komodo dragon  loose in a New Jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy.  The movie has no real violence  and though there are a few mild "bad" words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families.
