Watching this movie is a very bizarre experience.  Having attended high school in the countryside, close to large clusters of Amish farms, I had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing Amish teenagers.  I dismissed most of them as rumor.  This movie confirmed that those wild stories I heard were probably true.  A very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most Americans cannot even begin to comprehend.  Worth a rental at the very least
