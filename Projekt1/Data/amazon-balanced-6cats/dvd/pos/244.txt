Bob Clark's 1974 chiller classic, which went on to inspire many elements of "Halloween" and "When a Stranger Calls", is definitely one of the better, if not best, horror films out there. Period. Not high on blood, but very high on suspense, dread, atmosphere, and out-of-the-dark surprises. A sorority house (to include the lovely Olivia Hussey, the vulgar alcoholic Margot Kidder, and SCTV vet Andrea Martin) falls victim to vicious, violent, and altogether menacing phone calls during the Christmas holidays. Soon, students on campus begin turning up missing. Though some events do go unexplained (which could be positive, considering the mystery involved) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts, this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films, with the most tense, moody photography ever captured on film. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder turn in quite effective performances. Highly recommended
