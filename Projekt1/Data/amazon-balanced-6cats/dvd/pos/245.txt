My six year old (who has NEVER been very excited about exercise) really loves this DVD. The routine is active, fun and most importantly easy to learn.  Other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered. She completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning, she asked to do it again! My 2 1/2 year old has a great time "dancing" with us as well
