House 1 is darker than it's sequels but stll maintains the horror/comedy feel throughout.  

Don't expect to be blown away by outlandish Hollywood special effects. The majority of the special effects are not special.  But if you can get over that, you'll enjoy the movie.

DVD is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features. I doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film. I'm just happy it was released on DVD!

If you are a fan of low budget horror/comedy movies this movie may appeal to you. It's no Evil Dead, but it is an entertaining movie.
