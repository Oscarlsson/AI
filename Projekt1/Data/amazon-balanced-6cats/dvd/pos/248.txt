This movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90's and probably my favorite plot twister/ who done it along with M night shamylans films. this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great. anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress' neve campbell and Denise richards who are both perfect for they're rolls. The whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable. which is unexpected from john Mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film. bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from CSI. The 2 girls have "it" in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. I was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet Matt Dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act, and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to. infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool. i do miss neve campbell.. i wish she'd come back to films and it looks like she will. so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99.9% of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison. Ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts. take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole "it" thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of "cool" form that shoot, well i did anyway
