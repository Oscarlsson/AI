"The Incredibles", together with "Finding Nemo", "Shrek 1 & 2", "Madagascar" and the "Spy Kids" series, certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking. Particularly The Incredibles is a movie no kid (or adult as well) will ever get tired of watching. As for the plot... it is just plainly great. Things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle. But everything will change for Mr. Incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job.
My kids just love this movie (and so do I!
