Great movie!

Delivery of the order came in good time.

This 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with some interesting extras.  
I found the offtakes/blubbers to be in bad taste, but the rest of the extras were worth seeing.

Personnally I would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie.  Although it is interesting to watch, especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business, I find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself.  Just my personal preference.  No doubt others will have different opinions
