This boxed set is beautiful. Everything from the box itself to the discs. I have every individual season box, and the show is the most amazing show on Earth. But, I really wan't this Box Set. So tell me, since it was originally  a Limited Edition Box Set, why does it keep popping up here again? Is it not limited anymore? I hope it isn't. Does anyone know
