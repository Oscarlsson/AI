Sometimes I wonder how it is we don't live in a vigilante society.  People do such awful things and alot of times the system really can't/don't do anything for the victims.  Well, in this film, this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son's killer would be dealt with.  

Story takes place in a small town where the Strout family is a big deal.  You know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers.  There is also the Fowler family which also make their way in the town.  She is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son, Frank, that is dating an older woman (Marisa Tomei) and she has 2 sons.  Well, the Strout family's son is married to Marisa Tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they aren't even divorced yet.  Can't say that I blame him there, but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly.  

Moving along, the Strout's son kills Frank and because of the Strout's clout and the fact that the ex wife didn't actually see him fire the shot, he is going to get off with manslaughter.  This does not sit well with the Fowler's.  The Fowler's have a friend that has over 300 acres of land, so you can only imagine what happens.  I certainly don't condone vigilantism, however, I just loved the ending.  The Strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail, so since it appeared that he jumped bail, they will lose all of that.  Beautiful!  Then, they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets.  I couldn't help but get some satisfaction out of that myself.  Very real and very interesting.  Great movie
