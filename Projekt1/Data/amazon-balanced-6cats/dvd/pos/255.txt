Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker deliver once again in this follow-up to their great film "Rush Hour". This film follows on the premise of the first, with a bit of a reversal....this time Tucker is the fish out of water in Chan's Hong Kong.

As with my review of Rush Hour, I'll say up front that if youre looking for anything more than a fun-filled actioner, then this movie wont please you. It breaks no new ground and the plot is quite formulaic, but if you're looking for deep drama and character development...what are you doing watching a Chris Tucker movie?

Watch for a great cameo by Don Cheadle as a black man married to an asian woman who owns and runs a Chinese Soul Food restaurant in a black section of Los Angeles. That alone is worth a laugh. There is another stand-out cameo by Jeremy Piven as a gay clothing store clerk who mistakes them for a couple. Be sure to watch the end credits and catch all of Piven's ad-libbed outtakes that ended up on the cutting room floor. But then, as with all Jackie Chan films, half the fun is watching the flubs during the end credits
