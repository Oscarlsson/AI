Our one year old loves this one, and so do I.  The music is wonderful.  The creative incorporation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining and educational.  The children, little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child.  We watch this one most of all the Baby Einstein's that we have.
