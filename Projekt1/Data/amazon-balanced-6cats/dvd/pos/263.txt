This was a subject of much conversation when I was deployed to Saudi Arabia and it's still a favorite with most military and Civilians in Iraq. "Ground Hog Day" is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here.
