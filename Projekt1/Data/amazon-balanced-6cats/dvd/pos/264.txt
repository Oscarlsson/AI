Leather Wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper, because, you know, a dvd makes good toilet paper (maybe it's why he's so grumpy).
I would suggest purchasing it and watching it.  Michael Moore may be more to the left than some, but god, hasn't anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye?  It's less biased than the news is - he reports, you decide, and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion, but weren't.
Michael Moore is far more honest than the Republican talking heads (Rush, Coulter, Hannity).  Watch, enjoy, investigate further
