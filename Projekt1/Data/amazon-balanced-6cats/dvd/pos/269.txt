There are plenty of anti-Bush films and books around. If you only shall see or read one, this must be the best pick. I like Michael Moore very much, but he is not really a political heavyweighter. And i don't think Fahrenheit 9/11 is his best work, it does not mix humour and political insight as well as   the book "stupid white men" for instance. It is more like two or three movies in one. 
William Karel IS a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary. But what a documentary it has turned out to be. Very disturbing insights from informed sources, among them former CIA-agents. It is not usual to hear such plain speaking from "people in high places" just a few years after the events. This film is perhaps not as entertaining as Fahrenheit 9/11, but far more informative.
