My son was over 2 before we introduced BE videos.  There are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images, but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot, as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons.  Unlike some of the other BE's with random visuals, here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired.  Concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust BE video in Bonus Features. It has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons.  

And no I didn't care for the commercial either...
