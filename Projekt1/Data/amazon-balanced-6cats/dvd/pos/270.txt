  From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs.  The bonus material is cool, the sound quality's great, the visuals are always impressive, but it's the SONGS that are the real attraction.  As it should be.

  Two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album BOY, four in a row from the all-time masterpiece ACHTUNG BABY, and nearly everything from their Grammy-sweeping triumph HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB.  I also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums.  Good call! Also, Many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments, such as Running To Stand Still (a perfect hybrid of the Joshua Tree and Zoo TV versions), Elevation (longer, better build-up), Bullet The Blue Sky (check out Edge's extended blues jam in the final minutes), and Original of the Species (acoustic piano ballad).

  This was the first major U2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list.  For instance, when I saw them they played Miss Sarajevo, Stuck In A Moment, Gloria, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Instant Karma, Until The End Of The World, and others not represented here.  Here's hoping they release at least one more Vertigo Tour DVD...
