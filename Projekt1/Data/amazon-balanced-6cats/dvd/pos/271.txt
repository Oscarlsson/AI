I had never watched this film before ordering it, so I took the chance.  It turned out to be a smart buy!  As usual, Peck is just awesome.  He seems to fit this role well, as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man.  As the movie continues you  realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level.  I enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film.  Overall, this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer.  So, if you are considering purchasing this dvd, I'd suggest you buy it.  You'll enjoy it
