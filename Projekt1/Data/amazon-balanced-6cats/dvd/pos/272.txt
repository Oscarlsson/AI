China: The Panda Adventure is an IMAX film that tells a story..

So..in a sense the Pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary.  The story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving Ruth Harkness who has arrived in China to take care of the business affairs of her late husband.  Her husband, it seems was a great admirer of the Giant Panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them..This leads Ruth to seek these Pandas out to see for herself..As the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of China..The cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well..

Ruth is played by the lovely Maria Bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the Panda..

All in all..this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family..but be warned..it's more of a story involving the Panda and not a documentary.
