This DVD is amazing!  Perfectly puts the Blues on display through the high-points and the low points of the season.  The best thing about this dvd, besides the flying, is the respect they show the crew.  Yeah, the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff, but, they are FAAAAR from the stars of the show!  The maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide.  This dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do.  They truly go through the mill, but, they don't do a single thing with those Blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly.  This is FINALLY a dvd that shines the light on the pilots, BUT, makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots.  Great Job!!!
    Unlike the retired one who reviewed also (great review by the way!!!!), I would not like to be a pilot after seeing this!  I would rather get FAAAR more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it
