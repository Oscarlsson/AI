 The direction was A grade acting top class and to top it you had Eric and Clint eastwood .Eric fleming was mindblowing .One has yet to come across  an actor with his confidence class and authority .Yes I agree we always tend to focus on Clint forgetting that it was Eric who was mile ahead of him.Todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western.Yes the fact is without Rawhide there would be no Clint Eastwood
