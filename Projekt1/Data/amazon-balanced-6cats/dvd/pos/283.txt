Joe Versus The Volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that's romantic enough for girls, funny enough for guys, with effective visual symbolism, and appropriate for the whole family.  Maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life, or something like that, but at any rate it's pleasant to watch, at times profound, at other times funny. 

The beginning 3rd is about Joe (Tom Hanks) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy, really crummy job, primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical (oppressive) supervisor (Dan Hedaya). (I've been there myself, when I worked at Pines Mfg H&H Tooling and again at Toro, where everyone was on dope.)  Joe learns from his doctor (Robert Stack, of The Untouchables) that he has a "brain cloud" and only a few months to live.  The tone of the movie rises as Joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that's ever happened to him. He takes a former co-worker (Meg Ryan) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time.  

The next day billionaire Lloyd Bridges (Airplane) enters Joe's life with a bizarre proposition:  Since he's dying anyway, why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime.  Joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur Ossie Davis (The Client) and the billionaire's two daughters - both played by Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle), which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie, making it even more pleasant to watch
