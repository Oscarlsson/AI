This movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment. Sex, drugs, beating on people, stealing, whatever keeps boredom at bay. There is no script to speak of, just watching them being themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer. He's just as bad as Telly. 

I have no doubt that teens like this exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children. Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too. And small towns. And even rural areas. 

This movie isn't for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them.
