This film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy. It seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives, not unlike our own.  But it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity. It avoids going too far into the subjective. It doesn't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute/stagey displays of animal interaction. Instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments. But by the sheer genious of editing and writing, one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama.  The movie wisely lets the animals' behavior "do the talking", and doesn't try to push the viewers' judgement one way or the other. It left me rethinking everything I had assumed about  animals, emotions, and the nature of our (and by 'our' I mean all of God's creatures) existence
