I always love it when Prevention release another workout because I get bored easy and I like to mix workouts up.  I've loved all of the other Prevention workouts and knew I'd love this too.  Chris Freytag leads again and does another superb job.  There are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts.  The dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want.  That's a big plus so you don't get bored or pushed for time.  You can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc.  If, for example, you pick that you need to lose weight, there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already.  That is so helpful.  The moves are all basic no frills moves, but they are effective.  The first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder.  The body parts are all the ones you want to workout; arms, butt, abs and thighs.  All you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy.  This is so easy to do due to the programming, so there really is no excuse for not working out.  This can be done by practically anyone.
I also love how the other two girls exercising as well, aren't the kinds that yell and shout etc.  They are as professional as Chris
