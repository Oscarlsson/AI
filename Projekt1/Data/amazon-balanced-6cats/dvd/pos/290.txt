An absolute must have for all parents, families and professionals!  As a speech &amp; language pathologist, I have worked with special needs children for 17 years, and finally I have viewed a high quality product for children diagnosed with Down Syndrome.  Informative, comprehensive and heart warming are just a few words to describe this excellent DVD.  I would highly recommend it for not only families, but for ALL professionals working with this population.  In fact, I believe it should be part of the training and curriculum for all disciplines intending to serve these wonderful children.  Thanks for a great product
