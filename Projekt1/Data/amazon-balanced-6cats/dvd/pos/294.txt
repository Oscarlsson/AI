You want the greatest zombie film ever made in the most deluxe version DVD possible today? Buy this set today, as it includes 3 versions of the film, including Argento's take on the film, known as Zombi: Dawn of the Dead.

Dawn of the Dead has that 79 feel, with wide camera shots that allow the characters to breathe, unlike so many modern horror flicks that smother the stars with endless closeups.

The zombie gore is to be noted, as its quite gory near the end of the film and at some parts throughout, but no real feasting occurs till the end, for the ultimate payoff. Yes, the zombies are pasty and fresh, since the outbreak has just began, which joins a team of four who struggle to survive in a mall while the world is quickly overtaken in this, Dawn of the Dead, easily the strongest Romero entry, and amongst ALL zombie films
