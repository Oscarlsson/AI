A great ending to a great series, it left me craving more. Not olnly were the final revelations creatively developed the action itself was beautiful. Plus Mugen and Jin's final(for the time being) battle was great, leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle.  It was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie
