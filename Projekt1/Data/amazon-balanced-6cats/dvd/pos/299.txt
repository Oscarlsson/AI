I was thinking about purchasing all four of these movies, but to have them together in a box set is a beautiful thing. 
I will not bore you with the reviews of these movies, those who love Akira Kurosawa movies sees the stories closely matching those of Shakespeare, a Clint Eastwood Western, and Star Wars.
For the price and what you get, it's a steal
