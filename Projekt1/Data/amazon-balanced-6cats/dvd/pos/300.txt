My DVD had English subtitles.  The first act is the best.   Watching the young japanese couple interact is very rewarding.  There is so much subtlety and silent communicating.  No surprise, since it is revealed in the booklet that Jim Jarmusch (director) created this movie around the Japanese actress (Youki Kudoh). 
 'Life is Beautiful' star (and wife of Roberto Benigni), Nicoletta Braschi, stars in the second act.  More great quiet acting.  She is a true beauty.
Funny role by the late Screamin' Jay Hawkins.
Also appearing in the late Joe Strummer of the Clash
