SOUND OF MUSIC 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION (Fox) is the latest digital version of this beloved, timeless, film.  The two-disc set features an exceptionally sharp transfer and a rich audio mix but the real treat is the new commentary with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer (this in addition to the late Robert Wise's commentary).  

Among the wealth of new treasures in the six hours of extras is on location footage, screen tests (Mia Farrow sings) and a wonderful retrospective documentary "My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers."  

Sound of Music is perfect in all departments.  It's also that rare musical in which the music itself is naturally integral to the story and a counterpoint to the Nazi threat of the true-life plot.  Until hi-def DVDs arrive, this is the definitive edition for the library.
