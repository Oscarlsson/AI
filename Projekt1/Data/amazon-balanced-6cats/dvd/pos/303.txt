This is a great tape for anyone who wants a challenge!  You will deinately feel it in the legs.  I have the Ultimate Step Circuit and Burn and Firm and prefer this one as it seems to take you to depletion...until you can't do anymore.  Karen Voight is excellent at cueing and reminding about technique.  Comparable to The Firm Lower Body Split...another 5 star recommendation for feeling the burn
