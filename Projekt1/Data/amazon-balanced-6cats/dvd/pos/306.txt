I love the Simpsons!  Although the early seasons are classic, they seem to get better and more funny as they go on.  This season includes the episode where Milhouse's parents get divorced which is hilarious, and the one where Homer eats those hot chili peppers and freaks out!  Definitely worth the purchase, there are a lot of extras too
