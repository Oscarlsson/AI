Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding and believable performance in the role of Angela Bennett.  In this film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert. An online hacker friend calls to tell her he's found an amazing disk and is sending it to her to check out.  Unfortunately, he's killed in a plane crash before he can visit her. The disk turns out to have secret government information and is wanted by a terrorist group who plan the downfall of the U.S. government. Angela Bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and before she really realizes what she has, she finds that she's being stalked. What happens next is everyone's worst nightmare. Through the miracle of computers, the evil group steal Angela's identify and there are few people to vouch for her. The story quickly turns into a cyber thriller.

She tries to get help, but she appears to have no friends and doesn't even know her own neighbors. Her mother (Diane Baker) is in an institution and is apparently suffering from Alzheimer's.  Her former boyfriend, played by Dennis Miller does try to help her, but the forces of evil are difficult to hide from. 

Jeremy Northam delivers a spine tingling performance as the charming and mysterious Jack Devlin. A man you really want to trust, but should you?
