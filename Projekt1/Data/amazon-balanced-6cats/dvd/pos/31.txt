The Station Agent is a touching, yet off the beaten path kind of flick that I found simply endearing to watch. Fin (Peter Dinklage) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in New Jersey. Having a passion for trains, he embraces this as his home. However, he only wishes to be left alone and finds that's not as easy to do as he would have thought.

First, he discovers Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who has set up a food truck outside his home. Joe is a conversationalist, desperate to talk to anyone and everyone. Next Fin meets Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who almost runs him off the road, twice. These three appear to have nothing in common, and despite all odds, they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see. 

All three actors gave amazing performances. Dinklage, as always, commands every scene he is in. I've missed seeing him since the bastards at CBS quashed Threshold, so it was nice to see something with him in it again. Cannavale amused me with his character, Joe, who really needed to "get a life." The idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least. And Clarkson radiated as Olivia, a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her. 

What I liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through Fin's eyes. There were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average. Plus, there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier didn't even see that he was standing there, so she didn't ring him up until he could get her attention. It just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically.

All in all, excellent film
