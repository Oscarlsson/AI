This is a fine, leveled workout, including stretching, aerobics, abdominal exercises and strength training moves (without weights). Gilad takes you through it with plenty of advance cues and tips to help you change moves smoothly, and position yourself properly for optimum muscle and cardiac work. The 30 minute workout is just right for an early-morning, before work routine. The 60 minute version is an extended workout good for weekends. Much better than most of these videos, this is particularly well suited to middle aged fitness buffs.
