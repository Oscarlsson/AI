So, why give Justice League the full 5 stars?  Because it appeals to every generation in my family.  I bought this for my 4 year old son who is enamored with superheros.  As we hung out together watching the shows, I was as engrossed in the story as my son.  Then I noticed that my wife was intrigued; and so were the grandparents!  The characters and plots are very well developed for a "cartoon", so it is more like watching a dramatic series.  Watching the series allows you to pick up on sub-plots too; like the attraction between Batman and WonderWoman - Jean Jone's struggle to find a place as the last of his people - and the entire groups struggle to work together as a cohesive team.  Another excellent buy to consider would be the Spiderman the New Animated Series
