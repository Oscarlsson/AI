"Dave" is a lot of fun, as a look-alike gets to pretend to be president, gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power, and makes high-stakes enemies. I am a big fan of Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good here. Kevin Kline does well, as well. The forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile, and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love. Definitely worth a rental, if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag
