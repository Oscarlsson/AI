I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working!

The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene.

The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years.

If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie
