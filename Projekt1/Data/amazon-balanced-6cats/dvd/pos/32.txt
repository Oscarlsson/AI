2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in.

This film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well. Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't see another time when a race would even be appropriate.

And as for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes, should leave the dialogue to someone else. 

Yes, this film is for the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself
