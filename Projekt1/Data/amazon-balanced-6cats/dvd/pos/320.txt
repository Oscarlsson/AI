This movie was both entertaining and at times, hilarious.  Charlie Sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist, Denise Richards is funny as his ditzy, shallow girlfriend and Angie Harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper.  Also, Jon Lovitz is hysterical as Sheen's plastic surgeon best friend.  This movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor.  I highly recommend it.
