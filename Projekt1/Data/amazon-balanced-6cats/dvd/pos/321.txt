"Panic Room" is a great thriller- Jodie Foster's return to the big screen.  I'd assume most people would enjoy the film itself.  However, the real treat in the 3-Disc Special Edition is the behind-the-scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film.  Any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture
