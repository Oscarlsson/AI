I did not have any of the original trilogy on DVD.  I am happy to have the theatrical releases as I am not a fan of the SE's, particularly Jedi.  I was nervous due to bad reviews, but they look and sound great.  If you like Star Wars and want the original releases I highly recommend these.  If you already happily own the SE's or are feeling cheated or robbed in some way by repeated releases of the same movie, then don't buy these.
