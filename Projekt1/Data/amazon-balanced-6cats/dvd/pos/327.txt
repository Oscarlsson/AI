I was fourteen years old when I attended the New York Premier of this movie at the Rivoli Theater. I have the original Premier Book from the theater; which is NOT for sale. I immediately fell in love with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. So did millions of other young men. This movie did not win the award of the year; it was overshadowed by "Casablanca"; which in my estimation, was of inferior quality, compared to For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Bob Richard
