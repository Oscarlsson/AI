Terms of Endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by 
Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger.  It covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom Aurora and daughter Emma.  They have their differences; yet the love between them is always so obvious.  It's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other, even their sex lives.  

I've seen this movie several times, and everytime I cry at the end.  In spite of the death, the movie ends on a positive note, giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay.  

The budding relationship between Aurora and her neighbor (also brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between Emma and her husband and children.  

The most interesting aspect is that Emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her, when she has been cheating on him as well.  Somehow though we sympathize with Emma and her gentle lover (played by the very talented John Lithgow).  We feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship doesn't seem wrong.

If you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time, this is a perfect choice
