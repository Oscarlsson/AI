...but the movie was pretty good. I found myself highly disappointed in the book, and almost wasn't able to finish it. The characters were flat, the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages, and not a true story, so I wasn't sure what to make of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised though, to enjoy the movie immensely. It was long, but it kept the pace going throughout. The subtitling in the Latin and French was a bit mundane to drudge through, but it made the movie a bit more 'believable' than everyone speaking English when the main character is actually French.

Teabing was played brilliantly, and while Hanks was not who I would have thought for Langdon, he did a superb job in the role.

If you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense, it is well worth watching. Murder, mystery, suspense, action, drama... it's all there in this film
