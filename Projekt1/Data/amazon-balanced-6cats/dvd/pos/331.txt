The BBC created the perfect cast in this terrific film. Watching it is like entering into a more pleasant world than the one that exists today. It is lavishly adorned with beautiful costume and sets. The latest adaptation is an insult to the major players in the BBC version. Highly recommend to those who love Jane Austin and her works
