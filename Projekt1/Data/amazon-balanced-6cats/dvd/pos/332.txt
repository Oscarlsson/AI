i haven't seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block-
busters i had to rent it. my favorite part is when tom essex
played by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw the
head and the head said "get that damn screwdriver out of my head" i couldn't stop laughing it was so funny. i never really liked many horror-comedy movies but this one is really good.
the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook, he was not only
funny but he was very brave and sexy to boot.
if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing. he makes me want to watch it
over and over and over again
