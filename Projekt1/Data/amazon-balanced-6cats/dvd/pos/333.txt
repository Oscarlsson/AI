I saw Transamerica months ago and I still think about it.  There are many reasons, most obviously Felicity Huffman's portrayal of Bree, a man determined to become a woman, trying to close the door on his past, just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child.  But Transamerica also brings a funny, poignant, and at times visually beautiful road trip across the United States, in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles, let alone 3000.  It brings unexpected and uncertain romance.  It brings out humanity in all its characters (save one minor one), including Bree's bitter mother.  Finally, it -- plot spoiler here -- concludes with tentative reconciliation, acceptance, and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future.  Transamerica is not loud, not big budget, not spectacular, but there are few movies near as good as it.
