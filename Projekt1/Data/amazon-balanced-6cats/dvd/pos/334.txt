THIS IS A DVD THAT I THOUGHT WAS DATED. NOT!  IT WAS MADE IN 2002/3, AND DESERVES WIDE VIEWING.  I THOUGHT I MAY HAVE SEEN THE TITLE, BUT I HAD NOT. IT MAY BE CONFUSED WITH OTHER PREVIOUS SIMILAR TITLES. DONT PASS THIS BY, IT IS GRITTY AND ARTISTICALLY REALISTIC.  THE GRIT OF SOUTH CENTRAL L.A., IS AUTHENTIC AND HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR BIG CITY BEAUTY OF A SLUM AREA.  SHARE THIS DVD OR TITLE WITH FRIENDS....IT IS WELL WORTH THE RIDE IN A BLACK AND WHITE. IT IS SIMILAR TO "THE SHIELD" ON FX, BUT DEALS WITH THE RODNEY KING RIOTS IN L.A., AS A BACKDROP.
