This movie was the first DVD I ever bought!  It is truly a gem.  I like the Infinifilm bonus features.  (It may not have been called Infinifilm at this time.)  Brett Ratner is truly a comedic genius, and really gives the customer great quality DVD's.  

The movie is funny and interesting enough.  I enjoyed the scenes in several different locales.  I enjoyed the physical interactions between Jackie and Chris Tucker.  I think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated.  Jackie Chan is a genius at physical comedy.

I highly recommend this DVD.

Two thumbs up!!!
