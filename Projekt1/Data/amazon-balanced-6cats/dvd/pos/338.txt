I am a huge U2 fan and this is the BEST concert I have ever seen.  This concert is simply unbeliveable.  It proves to all those stupid people that the belief that U2 were only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage.  U2's still got it.  This concert proves it.  If you don't think U2's good anymore, go watch this concert.  All that You Can't Leave Behind is a good album.  Maybe not as good as Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby but it is still good.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb left a little to be desired.  And for the stupid guy at the beginning of these reviews (I think it was the first one) what do you mean Bono was supporting homosexuality???????????  When he kissed Edge, it was representing the betrayal of Jesus Christ.  Look up the lyrics to the song that they were singing,  "Until the End of the World."  "I took the money... I kissed your lips (face in the concert) and broke your heart."  Bono represents Judas Iscariot in the song.  Also, if you still don't believe me and think this is some love song or something, watch any U2 concert with this song- almost all of them show Bono doing a little devil-horn thing, usually after kissing Edge (Christ) The only thing I agree with in that guy's review is that Edge really is the spirit of the band, not Bono.  I love the delay that Edge uses in his guitar.  And I hate how when people think of U2 they think of Bono.  Bono's fine but I love how Edge plays.  Anyway, go read his review if you want to find out more.  Just don't listen to that homosexuality crap.  Anyway, this concert is awesome and I could just watch it over and over again.  In fact, I'm actually watching it tonight!  Great show- makes you feel like you're actually there.  U2 is a wonderful band with good Christian messages in their songs and I can't wait for their next album and concert to come out
