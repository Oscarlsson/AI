While this certainly isn't the best pearl jam concert ever it isn't the worst either. The first disc starts a little slow..but you can't argue with getting to hear song's like "In My Tree" and "Faithfull".

Highlights are:

Love Boat Captain...a nice opener. One of the best of riot act song's for sure.

In My Tree, one of, if not my favorite pj songs. Not quite as rocking as the 2000 tour performances but still great.

Gimme Some Truth.  Maybe not a technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt and passionate. Good john lennon cover.

Even Flow. Always great.

Spin the black circle...the band starts to get more into the show after this rocking performance.

Thumbing My Way...just a great slow song.

Breath. In my opinion the best performance of the show...just great.

Crown of Thorns. I really like this version of the song...played well whether you think ed should sing it or not.

Baba O'Reilly.  The classic "who" song. A great performance. Just try to sit still during this one.

I would reccomend this dvd to anyone that is a pearl jam fan already but if you're not then I would start with some of their studio albums first.
