This re-telling of the so-called "zoot suit riots" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly.  Part of it is the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense.  Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while doing some reseach on the "pachucho" R&B music scene -- but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate production.  It's hammy and ham-fisted.  Latter-day star spotting:  El Teatro Campesion veteran Robert Beltran (of future "Star Trek Voyager" notoriety) has a bit role as a modern-day audience member..
