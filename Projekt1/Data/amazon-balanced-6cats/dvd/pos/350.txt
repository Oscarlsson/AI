all things aside, the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end [stated this way without ruining the ending]played a great part as a supporting actor. his name is justin goncalves i think. this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played. in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid. believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had. i was particularly impressed with the part he played.
