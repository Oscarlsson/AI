I watched this film at the suggestions of a friend...Had to watch it again the very next night and have seen it several times since.  It's so nice to watch a film where people are acutally nice to each other and there is no offensive language or elicit scenes.
Just recently learned of some friends in a very similar situation and recommended the film to them to help work throught the emotions they are having.  Livvy, a young and educated woman finds herself pregnant shortly following the death of her mother.  The father of her baby leaves the scene and Livvy's father insists that she will not have a child out of wedlock and so arranges her marriage to a lonely farmer in a very rural area of Colrado.  Ray (the farmer) is shy and reserved, but was brought up with high moral values and treats Livvy like she is something special.  The rest of the movie develops the story of how Ray and Livvy get acquainted and eventually fall in love, even though that was not Livvy's original intention. 
I think the film has a powerful message about forgiveness and forbearance.  I have purchased several copies and love to share it with friends.  I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!
