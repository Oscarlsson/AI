This one of those movies that I can watch over and over again.  The story is great, acting is good, and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best.   The force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity I would love to go on a Tornado hunt.  The special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie.  I would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars.  The loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts.  Rent it, buy it, watch it!  It is well worth your time and money.
