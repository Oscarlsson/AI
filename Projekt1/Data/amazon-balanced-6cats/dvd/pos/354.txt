I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around. All the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do see some perennial "best of" favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's. If wwe continues releases with rarer footage, I think they'll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase
