I purchased this DVD because it said it was an easier pilates video to do; basically anyone, even beginners, could do it.  I have to disagree.  I started this video and tried to do all of the 5, ten minute sections.  It wasn't completely hard, but definitely challenging.  I am not the most fit person, but also not the most unfit.  I had a harder time because I am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video.  I am not saying I wouldn't suggest it, I am just saying it's not definitely for beginners.  However, the instructions are clear and since it's broken up into the five-ten minute sections it gets even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it
