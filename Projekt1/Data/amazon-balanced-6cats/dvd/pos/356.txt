Great improvements over the original DVD. Enhanced for 16x9 TVs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio.  The original dvd claims an aspect ratio of "approximately 2.35:1" which was not true. I own both versions and have compared viewing aspects  of each. Clearly this DVD is far superior and well worth the purchase price.  This plays very well on my HDTV monitor; I'll give the old version to someone w/ an old 4x3 TV.
