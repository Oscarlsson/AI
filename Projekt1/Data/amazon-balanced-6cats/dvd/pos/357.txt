Not very familiar with Noam Chomsky's work but I have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments. This film is proof of those arguments. Noam Chomsky has facts, refers to original sources, provides context and analysis and leaves  you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well-research argument. This film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world. America's invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9-11, and other topics are rich and insightful. This film provides a nice balance on Chomsky by giving us some insight into HIM which is interesting. I find him more fascinating now than I did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material. This film gives those new to Noam Chomsky's books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so. After watching this film I went out and read 9-11 and his latest book. While good, the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner.
