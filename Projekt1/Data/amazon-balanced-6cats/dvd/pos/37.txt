saw the trailer online and knew I'd love it on dvd
I was right
laughed my ass off 8 times after watching it
so many times of the 8 times I watched it that is
it is sad Tucker couldn't be in this one and last Friday movie but it's still great
the new cast members add more humor just as much the ones in the second and first Friday movies
the plot is deeper
more twisted
more funny
more senseless
especially with Day Day
i laughed so hard
the extras are worth it
Cube is great at making films
so no one slam him
he is an amazing film maker
considering he used to star in movies
when he can star in one and create it
that's more then genious
that's innovative
he does good at starring and making movies
give him props people
and you can't always please everyone with what you make
remember that
I loved this one. and will get the other 2 movies on dvd when I can. the scenes are just hilarious and priceless like the other Friday movies. so glad i bought this on dvd. give it a chance people.
