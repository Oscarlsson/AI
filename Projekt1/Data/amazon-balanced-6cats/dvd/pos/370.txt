They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.  

Charlie Sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war.  This seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie.  He finds out alright.  Keith David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role.  He cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked.  The supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here.  Overall this is my favorite movie of all time.  It has stood the test of time and never fails when I want to see a good movie.  

I just have the old special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice.  It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film.  There is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was mroe than glad I got the special edition.  You would nto believe what the actors went through!  It is a great making of.
