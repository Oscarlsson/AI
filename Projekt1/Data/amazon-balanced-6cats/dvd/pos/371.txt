I was introduced to the Matthew Shepard story by MTV's dramatic presentation of Matthew's last days in Laramie. With that as my background, I entered The Laramie Project with curiosity regarding the reactions of Laramie's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention. 

Matthew was a human being, undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death. Shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several Laramie residents, but not everyone shared that view. That fact was refreshing. The law enforcement officer who freed Matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic. Her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed, but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent. Other Laramie residents were just as horrified. The so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected, but equally unnerving. This film, though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed, has the feel of a documentary. Knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times. But the presentation was enlightening. 

The film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that - crimes. No matter what a person's viewpoint, lifestyle or background, no one has a right to take on the position of punisher. Humans are not animals. Or, at least they shouldn't act like them. The Laramie Project exposes the heart of many people after the Matthew Shepard murder. It is worth the watch
