This film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9/11(it's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb). I also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on Tim Allen and the comparisons to "Get Shorty" rather than as a plot driven movie. I tell you though, this film is simply funny. 

Just like an old Marx Brothers film, the plot is there only to set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between the characters. I have enjoyed both of Dave Barry's humor novels(this and "Tricky Business"). They made me laugh out loud as did this movie. I think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly.  For those that have laughed at Dennis Farina from his roles in "Get Shorty and even "Snatch,"  he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks(literally) on his trip to do a quick sniper job.  Tom Sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you'll ever see. 

There are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh, no matter how many times you have seen it. 

Check this one out!
