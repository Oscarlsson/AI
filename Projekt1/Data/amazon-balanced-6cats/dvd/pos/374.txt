well, Season 5 for me was a little bit of a dissappointment but still contain the character plot line (or the theme as many will call it) of Southpark itself.  Since buying this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped off.   My interest in Southpark was revisited with Season 6 (also available on DVD)  However,  If you like South Park or love it this is for you of course without saying.  However, If you just joining in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all together, but this season was good
