Truly frightening, gruesome, a gore-fest, a bloodbath, AND it has a plot... really, there are a lot of clichï¿½ expressions to describe this movie but they're all true: It's a HORROR movie in the true sense of the word.

I hadn't seen a Rob Zombie movie before this one, but I would have to say, after seeing it, that it's got to be his masterpiece. I don't see how he could top it. "House of 1000 Corpses" is NOT a movie that people who don't like the genre should be watching. I don't think they'd be able to stomach it. It's a downward spiral of evil, depredation, degradation and mayhem out of an imagination that must be really SICK (but awesome). The sense of humor in the movie actually doesn't spoil it, it just makes it better, it's so malicious. The atmosphere, the acting, the special effects and makeup, everything contributes to an hour-and-a-half long ride through a freak show that shouldn't be missed by true horror-movie buffs. Buy it, rent it, whatever. If you love being scared, you'll love this movie. It delivers!
