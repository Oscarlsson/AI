This is a fine collection for those who have recently discovered early REM as well as those who own REM's previous IRS years video collection: Succumbs.  The Succumbs videos are all here, with some variation, and the additional videos/footage are excellent.  Very serious fans will want more, but this is better than nothing and worth the price.
If you like early REM then you may like:

2) Banjos And Sunshine by Sixty Acres

4) Massachusetts by Scud Mountain Boys
