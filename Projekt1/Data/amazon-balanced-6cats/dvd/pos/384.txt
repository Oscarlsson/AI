At last!  A full-length Jimmy Buffett concert on DVD!  It's been a while coming but this is a beauty.  There are so many highlights it's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the DVD.  The sound is superb, the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a Jimmy Buffett concert is captured perfectly.  The song mix is terrific - everything from Buffett classics like Volcano, to new classic like Piece Of Work, to iconic covers like Southern Cross.  Seeing Jimmy and the Coral Reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a Buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience!  For me, a favourite moment is the concert finale of Steve Goodman's City Of New Orleans.  Steve now resides under home plate at Wrigley and I'm sure he was singing along as well.  Buffett fans and new Parrotheads alike will find this DVD one to watch many times over
