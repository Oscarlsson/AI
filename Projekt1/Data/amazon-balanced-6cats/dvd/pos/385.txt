Georges Seurat was totally insane by the age of 32.  Knowing that helps Stephen Sondheim's genius show through. Sunday in the Park with George is an amazing show about the life of this manic artist, and the fictional personalities of the figures in his painting "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte". The first Act is completely devoted to a set of Sundays spanning 2 years of Seurat's life and the end of his relationship with a long-time lover. The dramatic and touching songs make you feel for this hard-nosed painter yet comical points shine through. The second act takes place 100 years later in 1984 with the Great-grandson of Georges (also played by Mandy Patinkin) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his relative so much posthumous fame. Like other Sondheim shows it is at times long-winded, but altogether entirely enjoyable. Mandy and Mrs. Peters' voice have so much emotion and power that, with the correct sound system, you are carried to the brink of pure delight and insanity by their performances. With Commentary from the actors and producers this is an essential for one who collects musicals
