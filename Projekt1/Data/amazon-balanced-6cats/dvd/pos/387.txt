Spurlock has brought new meaning to reality shows.  Constructive, insightful, inspirational, educational, and entertaining, these very interesting journeys had me hooked for 6 hours straight.  Just think what you could do with your own life in 30 days! Should be emmy nominated; it's that good.  Brilliant
