I'll start out by saying that I prefer the Jason movies.  I think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie.  The Freddy movies are good horror movies, but they're not really slashers like I thought they would be.

 - A Nightmare on Elm Street - 

A great, classic horror movie by Wes Craven.  He creates good high school characters, although trying to prove that they're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched.  Freddy is more horrific and scary, he doesn't say much.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge - 

They were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of Freddy in this sequel.  Many will disagree, but I don't think it's a bad movie, it's just very dark and horrific.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors - 

Definately a step up from Part 2.  It goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back Nancy, who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital.  The style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master - 

Decent entry in the series carrying over characters from #3 and introducing all new characters.  The story doesn't flow as easily this time around and it's a step down from Part 3, but still good.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child -

Stephen Hopkins' visual style makes this the best sequel in the series.  Freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great.  The story is more interesting than Part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good.

- Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare - 

Cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an American town?  Rachel Talalay thinks the 3-D effects in the film are lame, but not that story element?  If it weren't for the interesting backstory on Freddy, this wouldn't be a good movie.

- Wes Craven's New Nightare - 

Wes Craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here, but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series.  Better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies.

- Nightmare Encyclopedia - 

Alot of interviews that aren't edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk.  It's good to see that these interview aren't self serving at all and they're completely retrospective, it would've been nice to hear more from Heather Langenkamp, or possibly Johnny Depp?

This is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans.  I'm a huge fan of the Alien series and a pretty big fan of the Predator series, but not as much as Alien.  I would say that I'm now a huge fan of Jason and a good sized fan of Freddy in comparison to Alien/Predator.  I do recommend these movies, but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today
