My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller.  This is a classic that every high school student should see.  It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best.  It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star
