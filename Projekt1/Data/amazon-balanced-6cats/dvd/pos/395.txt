The Firms "Super Body Sculpt" is a 40 mins, 3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs.  Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete total body workout.  The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups, lat rows and french presses and biceps.  The Lower Body section focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last leg press exercise, there are more squats  that will make you want to scream "Enough".  I found the Abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques.  The stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my favourite.  Overall it is very well instructed.  You can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg presses and squats.  I usually do all three segments to get the full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool to a firm body
