i just wanted to say this is a great workout. i love the eastern dance styles. i have just written a long review of honey's bollywood workout,and people were saying the same things, too fast etc...but indian dance is taught by imitation, and is very expressive facially and bodily(especially the classical dances) and open to improv. bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical. most don't realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating, learning, and memorizing from the beginning. the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so, because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying. so have fun with this, it's awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned. and it really wears you out. plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form! but i find eastern to be the most passionate, feminine, beautiful, and divine. have fun
