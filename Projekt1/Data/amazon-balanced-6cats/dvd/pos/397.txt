Haven't we all been there? Wishing we could be better than someone else? Wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight? This is exactly how the movie "Cheaters" affected me. I found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this. The plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question "What would I do in this situation?" Jeff Daniels and Jena Malone give such incredible performances in this movie. I believe that they are very convincing. If you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie, "Cheaters" is the true direction for you to head in
