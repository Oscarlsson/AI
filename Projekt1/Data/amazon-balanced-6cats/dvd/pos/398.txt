This is my favorite toning workout and I'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest. What I like best about it is that I can customize it to whatever body part I think needs the most work this week. Need a 30 minute ab workout? You can choose it. Think the arms and legs need work? No problem. Want to tone a little bit of everything? You can do that, too.

The instructors are all good - clear, not irritating, and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video. 

This was one of my best purchases, workout-wise. I wish there were more DVD's/workouts out there with Minna Lessig - she is my favorite instructor (she does the arm/leg workouts on this DVD). The other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by, although at the end you do know you've worked those muscle groups.
