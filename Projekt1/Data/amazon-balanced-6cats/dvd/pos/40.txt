Spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health; eat nothing but McDonald's fast food for 30 days.  The result; his health gets ruined.

While Spurlock's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the Lancet, it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health.

I rarely eat McDonalds (though I enjoy the odd coke) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in Australia, as it is worldwide.  The strength of Mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer.  McDonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food, and made Ray Kroc (its founder) a fortune.  

I don't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil, because they are multinational corporations; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers, as well as shareholders.  We happily buy coke, McDonalds, cigarettes, and many other things obviously bad for our health, and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad.  In our individualistic culture, we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control, and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists.

However, the rocketing levels of obesity, especially amoung children, are of great concern, and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical.  We need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction, otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents.  Spurlock's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously, and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence
