I heard so much about Masaki Kobayashi's "Harakiri", so I bought it at Amazon and watched it.  Wow, this movie is awesome!!  Now I don't know who is my #1 favorite director, Akira Kurosawa or Masaki Kobayashi. This black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by Tohru Takemitsu.  In addition to these assets, the camera is wonderful.  I pick this movie as one of "my movies of my life".  Tatuyua Nakadai was shining in this movie.  I like him more after seeing "Harakiri".
