Hi Folks,

the movies all look very good..and there are a nice group  of bonus features from vintage featurettes to  commentaries!  On  Macao...I particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with Jane Russell and  Robert Mitchum  that Robert Osborne conducted...very late in the life of Mr Mitchum.  The packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great Robert Mitchum at under $10 each on DVD w/bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal!

The movies aren't generally considered Mitchum's best or best known but when you consider you've got Jean Simmons as a costar and Otto Preminger directing Angel Face,  Josef Von  Sternberg helming  Macao, Vincent Minnelli directing HOme From The Hill, The great Fred Zinneman directing and the legend Deborah Kerr co-starring in the Sundowners ...you can figure this isn't the bottom of  the barrel either!  Oh and Sydney Pollack directed The Yakuza and contributes a great commentary....

To  sum up...warner Bros...continues to deliver THE VERY BEST classic titles on  DVD with the best combination of quality transfers/bonus features and value packages!!!!
