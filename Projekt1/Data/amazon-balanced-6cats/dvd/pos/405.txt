I like this movie a lot - not just because it is made by Visconti (one of the greatest cinematic figures of the 20th century) or because of its cast (Dirk Bogarde and Helmut Griem are always good) - no, I think it is the way the film attempts to look at a bigger picture through the corruption that surrounds a wealthy family that makes this film so interesting.
You can see elements of this style in other Visconti films like the Leopard, in Coppola's Godfather trilogy, and in Fassbinder's Maria Braun.  Now to speak of Visconti's visual genius - Has there ever been a director who could sustain a scene in such a virtuosic way as in the nazi 'party' scene midway through the film - Or again in 'Death in Venice' - with the scenes on the beach. Anyway enough of my babble - just see the films of Visconti - and you will see what I mean
