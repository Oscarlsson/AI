I saw this back in 1985 when if first came out.  It was wonderful.  At first, I thought it was going to be one of those historical/tourist shows.  But it wasn't.  It could have been, though.  
Mr. Wood is a very charismatic presenter.  But is what's better is that he took the story of the story of the Trojan War from the pages of modern myth to reality.  I have read Homer and I knew about Schlieman, but other than that, I was ignorant of the Trojan War.
Mr. Wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level.  I was fascinated by the connection he made to the Hittite Empire.  The thought had never occurred to me that if a Troy did exist, it might have trade relations with empires to the east.  He also included experts in the fields of archeology, modern history and history of the period.
I thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have seen it several times.  I also have the Alexander dvd and Shakepeare.  "In Search of Shakespeare", was fun.  Wood took the story of Shakespeare down to the center of his human story.

I would recommend all the Wood "In Search of..." programs.  If you can't find the films, then read the books.  The books are just are entertaining.
