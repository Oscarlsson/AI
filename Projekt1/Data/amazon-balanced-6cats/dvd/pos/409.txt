Notice to parents, there is some verbal material unsuited for little ones,  adult nature. A woman grows to 50-ft placing an extra strain on a strained  marriage. Daryl Hanna and Daniel Baldwin. This is a light monster film not  gory. It is good for that it carries some laughs, punny stuff, and summer  flick character. No deep story, folks
