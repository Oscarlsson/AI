Brando can sing!!
Guys and Dolls is proof. One of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955, has Brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by THE VOICE - Sinatra. Now only a mad man will say that Brando is a better singer than Sinatra, but to give Brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad man will say Sinatra is a better actor than Brando.

Guys and Dolls is a very important film in Brando's career. It is the first light hearted movie he made. All his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff. This is the first movie where Brando is having fun and what fun it was.

Great songs, great acting and great stars...GUYS and DOLLS is 4 star entertainment all the way.

Brando and Simmons along with Sinatra and Blaine are amazing.
