Crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three Australian soldiers in the Boer War accused of killing prisoners and a Dutch minister. The British command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the Germans, who seem eager to join the war on the side of the Boers, to stay out. The men claim they were only following orders, orders which went against "normal" military practice. This is a new type of warfare: the Boers fought as guerrillas, not in uniform, not by "the rules." The Australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms. The morality of war itself, therefore, is just as much on trial as these men. They all lose in the end. The trial scenes are well paced, and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension. Also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting. Well worth a watch
