Ok, first of all Oct Fri the 13th I FINALLY saw this movie in 3D, sigh I can die happy! Ok this one is really pretty awesome. Chris plays a great leading girl (the only F-13 leadI didnt want to see with an axe in her skull). The other characters are pretty harmless too. Wev'e got bikers (snort), pothead hippies, a fro'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act. Plus this came out in the early 80's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes. I give this one a high-5! Cool deaths, funny scenes and aside from Chris's sherbert pants, some decent 80's fashion too. Yo Debbie, I want your bikini, too cuuute.
