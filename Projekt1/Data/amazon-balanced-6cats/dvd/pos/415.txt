Expect a liberal dose of everything you generally do from a martial arts flick -- slapstick comedy, overly melodramatic subplotting, and, on occasion, even a hint of a story. 

All that aside (which is how I am sure the director saw it) the balletic, intricate and often incredible stunt work during the action scenes is an absolute treat. Jet Li's utter disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance, nothing like his forgettable Hollywood yawns.  

The subtitles for this Mandarin-language effort are a bit difficult to read, since the English is in small print below the more prominent Chinese subtitles. But when the action kicks into gear, forget them and just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes.

Notably notable in the three installments: 

PART-I:  
A mind-blowing hook-and-ladder battle, plus a terrific umbrella sequence.

PART-II: 
The climactic fight with Donnie Yen. The speed and technique shown during the double-pole fight is staggering; Yen's moves with his cloth staff left me gob-smacked. 

PART-III: 
This one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable. The final fight scene at the lion-dance competition is a colorful pageant, but lacks the impact of the one-on-one fights in the first two films, mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion head masks.


All in all, can't go Wong with this purchase.
