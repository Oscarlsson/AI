This film is a must-see for any dancer.  The clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative.  Many famous scenes from the old MGM  musicals to the water spray scene in Flashdance are used to illustrate how  diversified dancing in films can be.  For ballet dancers, there is a  portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by Mikhail  Baryshnikov.  Scenes of Rudolph Nureyev leaping through the air compliment  this section as well as scenes from various ballets.  Liza Minelli hosts  the Broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length.  I only saw  this film once but I feel that it is a must-own selection for any dancer
