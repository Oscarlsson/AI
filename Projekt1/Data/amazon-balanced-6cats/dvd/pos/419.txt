This workout is nice because it doesn't mess around.  There are no long introductions you can't fast-forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series (which is all legs and hips) are really challenging and I plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery.  One complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they aren't available very widespread in retail stores.  I also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout.  All in all though great
