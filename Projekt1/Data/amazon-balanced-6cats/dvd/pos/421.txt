My husband received this DVD for his birthday. My husband grew up with the Pittsburg Steelers and still today is a true fan. As a family we all sat and watched this wonderful DVD on the Steelers and all of us enjoyed it very much. It goes back to the begining of time for the Steelers, it shows the superbowls and how the steel curtin got it's name. If you love the steelers then this 2 DVD set is a must have. You will not be disappointed
