While it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers,this HISTORY OF ROCK simply doesn't jell as a whole.By trying to explain the evolution of the music,the pleasure gets lost along the way.If you are a rock connaisseur,you won't learn many new things if you watch this.What you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field(ex:MOTOWN or BRITISH INVASION).As it is,it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like EMERSON,LAKE AND PALMER and KING CRIMSON among others.It costs me $80 dollars (CANADIAN money)for this 5 dvd set, which is too much for what it's worth.Rent it and enjoy the clips
