Release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own. It will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see... i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have. You also get to find out who Dirty is or whatever. Pete says things about him in a couple of places (online) and all i could think is "who is that?" so thats also very exciting. I would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this.
remember: its the stuff deemed 'unfit' for "my heart with always be the b-side to my tongue
