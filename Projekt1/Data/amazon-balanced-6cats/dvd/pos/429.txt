While I thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie, this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies.  All have their funny moments.  I still enjoy the first the best.  Mainly because the jokes were original and fresh.  Though it is still funny to see the strange things Jim would get himself into.  Levy as his father was a great choice.  This is worth the 20 dollars easy.  Lots of laughs, and plenty of gross out humor
