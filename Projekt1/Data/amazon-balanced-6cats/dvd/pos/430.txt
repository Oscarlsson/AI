It's not a great movie, but it's a lot of fun.  This is one of those movies that just catches me.  It's quirky and has some decent (for it's day) effects.  There are a feww laugh out loud momments.  Truth be told they are few and far between.  

Some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble.  The cast is pretty damn cool, with Urich being upstaged by Ron Pearlman, Angellica Houston, John Mat.. Mattus... The big guy.  Anyway, it's cornball comedy with a basic plot.  

Hey what do you want?  It's 80's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been.

I still giggle at the time warp battle
