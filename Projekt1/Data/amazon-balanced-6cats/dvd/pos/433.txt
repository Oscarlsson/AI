Maggie Gyllenhaal played her part to perfection, scarily so.  She's the perfect sociopath, only thinking of herself while using her daughter, as well as anyone else she encounters, as a foil.  She's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path.

All in all a real slice of life film accurately depicted, directed and played
