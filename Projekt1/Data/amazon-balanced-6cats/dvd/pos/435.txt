I saw the original about 4-5 times from 1970-1971.. This one is not much different, just modestly.. I had been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years, but was unable because the Studio (Warner Bros.) refused to release it under any format.. I was thrilled that it was finally released, and have since been watching it with many friends.. Most had no idea this movie was ever out.. I was particularly interested in Anita Palenburg, she has really changed over the last 38 years.. The content may be a bit provacative for most (Sex and Violence) but the quality are extraodinary for that era.. This one is a must for anyone.
