In an attempt to meet more girls, I took French many, many years ago when I was still in junior high school (middle school to you young 'uns). In class, my French teacher treated us to a film screening of Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). Truthfully, back then, I didn't think much of it other than being something too "arty." But, over the past two decades, I've seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it. LA BELLE ET LA BETE is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema. It's certainly Cocteau's masterpiece. Without a doubt, it provided the direct inspiration for Disney's Oscar-nominated version, as well as greatly influencing CBS's 1987 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST television series.

Jean Cocteau took Madame Leprince de Beaumont's classic story, adapted it, and put his own stamp on it. Cocteau's artistic vision is dazzling to behold. The viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues, ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch  candles, vocal household objects, jewelry which turns to rubbish, etc. But nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative, surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around Belle's family, which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance.      

This atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads, Josette Day and Jean Marais. Josette Day, as Belle, her most luminous role, personified beauty, grace, and class. Jean Marais, on the other hand, made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel Avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted Beast. In fact, Marais portrayed the fearsome Beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that, in the end, when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince, Cocteau and Marais actually received many letters of complaint. The women much preferred their kindly Beast.
