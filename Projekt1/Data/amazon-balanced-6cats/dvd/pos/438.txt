"Domestic Disturbance" is a thriller about a divorced couple and their child.  Frank (John Travolta) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife Susan.  The guy (Vince Vaughn) is well liked by the community, but there are hints of something being amiss with him.  Frank's son claims he witnesses his mother's new husband Rick commit murder.  The more Frank investigates Rick, the more suspicious he looks.  The investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse.

There is great interaction between Travolta as a concerned parent and Vaughn the cold heartless type.  The tension between them breeds suspense.  The would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him.  There are few things he wouldn't do to get his way.  

"Domestic Disturbance" is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action.  I highly recommend it for those who enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last minutes.
