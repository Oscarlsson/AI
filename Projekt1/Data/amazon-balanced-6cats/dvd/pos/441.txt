  Daniel Deronda is George Eliot's 1876 novel dealing with the
rise of Zionism incarnated in young Daniel Deronda. Sadly but truly this is the first major English novel giving a positive view of the Jewish people.
  Deronda is raised by the wealthy Sir Malinger as an English
gentleman. In the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a Jew; meets his mother and is the love object of
two fascinating women.
Mirah Lapidoth is the Jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by Daniel. Her love for Daniel burgeons as she comes to
know and love the kind young man.
Gwendolyn Harleth played by the brilliant acting of Romola
Garai is the spoiled,impecunious husband hunter who weds the
rich cad Grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates!
She loves Deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of
psychological combat. 
  Like all BBC productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors. The scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear.
   This tale runs about four hours and is a joy.Many American
viewers may be dismayed at the slow, leisurely pace of British
productions. Please remember that these productions are based
on long English novels which were published in several monthly
parts. They are long but they are also wonderful explorations of
the human soul. Gwendolyn's story is a bildungsroman in which she
grows as a person. Ditto for Deronda who learns to take pride in
his Hebrew heritage.
  This is a worthy BBC production well worth the viewer's time and money
