While this DVD was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times, the genius of David Bowie shines  through. As adults too young to remember or have seen Ziggy Stardust, it was an amazing look at the time period. The sound quality is suprisingly good, although some camera angles are distracting at times. It was also neat to hear Bowie's pronouncement of "This is our last tour ever." Little did he know... This DVD is worth every penny. Rock on
