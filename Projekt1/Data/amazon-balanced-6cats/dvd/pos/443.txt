The transfers of the 5 movies found here are worth every penny! We grew up watching these on Philadelphia's channel 17 with show host Dr. Shock and the Creature Double Features back in the mid 70's. The pictures were always so dark and grainy, WELL NOT ANYMORE FOLKS! Universal has done an Amazing job on the picture clean-up and sound restoration! Bright and crystal clear along with wonderful sound! Also a very nice fold out DVD holder! The theatrical trailers were transferred in their original release condition which will allow you to compare how good of a job was done on the restoring of the movies to DVD! Don't wait to long in purchasing your set at a cheap price, they have already disappeared off of store shelves in our area!
