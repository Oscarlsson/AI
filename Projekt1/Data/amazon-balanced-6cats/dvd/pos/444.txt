The series just keeps on getting better.

The Bob Newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television.   The other funny show was "Newhart", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD.

The whole cast just clicks.  I wish shows like this were still on television.

If you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets!
