If you're looking for a video that doesn't take a lot of time, then this is one that you should add to your collection.  It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or have been doing this stuff for years, there are two levels to suit both challenges.  10 minutes is spent on abs, buns &amp; thighs.  You can choose to do all of them or one of them when you get a spare 10 minutes.  The exercises are great and you can feel the burn in all your muscles.  If you do this video 3-5 times a week and eat a healthy diet, you'll easily lose inches and tighten up those &quot;loose&quot; areas
