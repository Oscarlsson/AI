I don't often watch foreign films.  The reason being, as an American, I don't feel that I can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works.  French....  Spanish....  German...  etc.... regardless of nationality, genre, or time period, they generally leave me cold.   

With that in mind, I went into this with no doubts as to the film's greatness, but again, didn't think as an American I would be able to see it, as the situational nuances would be lost on me.   As it turned out, I was wrong, and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily, and didn't seem obtuse or "foreign".   The experience could best be likened to watching "The Graduate", as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations, but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching. 

I won't recap the storyline, or discuss details of the movie itself, I just wanted to say that I went into this skeptical, expecting to find a picture that I couldn't relate to, but what I found was an immediate, compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition.
