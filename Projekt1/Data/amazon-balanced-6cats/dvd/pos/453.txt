I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' - released in France in 2001 - for two reasons.  First, it features an all-star ensemble of French acting, certainly a tribute to Veber's skill as a director.  Just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the IMDB credits:

Daniel Auteuil ....  François Pignon 
Gérard Depardieu ....  Félix Santini 
Thierry Lhermitte ....  Guillaume 
Michèle Laroque ....  Mlle Bertrand 
Michel Aumont ....  Belone, the neighbour 
Jean Rochefort ....  Kopel, the director 

Imagine a movie where the great Jean Rochefort gets slotted sixth.  Each of these six stars can carry a movie in France on their own back.  The fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to Veber's reputation.  His previous release, 1998's 'The Dinner Game,' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece.  Actors get attracted to that type of skill.

The second reason I got a kick out of watching 'The Closet':  I just learned that 'Bend It Like Beckham' writing partners Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges are prepping a UK re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release, with Chadha at the helm.  Her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by Beckham's runaway success, so I feel like I'm in on a really great secret knowing she's working on a re-make.
