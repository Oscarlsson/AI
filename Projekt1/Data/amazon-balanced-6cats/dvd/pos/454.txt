Overall, this is an extremely awesome concert. I am a big fan of DT, and like pretty much all their stuff. The performance itself is pretty good, although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and Jordan's keyboard solo. Other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album. If they had done more special things, it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. Other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance, but  would say they did okay as far as that goes. Sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand, thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him, although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands, and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them. The special features are also pretty good, but i would not buy this concert just for those, backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves. Overall, i did think it was pretty cool, and i would recommend buying it if you like Dream Theater or just their genre of music in general
