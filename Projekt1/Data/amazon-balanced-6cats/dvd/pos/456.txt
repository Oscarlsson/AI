Ladies in Lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today.  This is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character.  Beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful Ladies, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, take on those roles.  This movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection.

The movie takes place in a small Cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation - perhaps isolation from life, from emotions and from vulnerabilities.  The sisters Ursula and Janet Widdington, played by Dench and Smith, spend a quiet, uninvolved existence, venturing out rarely.  But on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm.  A bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate.  This one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions, feelings that have been hidden for so many years.  It is the ability of Dench and Smith to portray these emotions, these feelings, for the camera that make this movie sing.  And the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by Daniel Bruhl and Natascha McElhone.  Together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening's entertainment.
