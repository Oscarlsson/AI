I enjoy all three of the the Jurassic Park movies, though I think &quot;The Lost World&quot; is a bit weak.  While I think that anyone who enjoys action movies, monster movies, or horror movies should own all three, I find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies, but a fourth DVD containing substantial background information on the making of the movies.  I give this collection four stars only because the larger, more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two, you will definitely like the third movie
