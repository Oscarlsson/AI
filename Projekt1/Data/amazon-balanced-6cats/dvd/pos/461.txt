This documentary on the life of Louis Armstrong, one of the major proponents of the jazz genre of music, is a quick look at how Louis Armstrong developed into a jazz musician as a vocalist, trumpeter, band leader, and arranger.

'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' starts with Louis's life growing up in New Orleans and how he spent much of his time in an orphan home playing in a band, which is where his skill had room to take off.  The documentary follows his move to Chicago and his involvement in the early jazz recordings.

The DVD contains excerpts of live performances and also tracks Louis Armstrong's gradual but swelling rise to fame and how he attained the nickname "Satchmo".  Louis, with his love for performing, became a famous musical figure and eventually had the rare achievement of being featured as a performer in many movies.  The docu-biography reveals how Louis never lost his lovable, down-to-earth manner, even with the increased size of his audience.  Louis was just Louis, and he would always be loved for his smile, his lovable personality, and of course his music.  

Containing interviews with Tony Bennett and Wynton Marsalis, 'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' is a pleaser about a jazz player's rise to become an enormously famous popular entertainer.  And he never lost his charm.  We love you, Louie
