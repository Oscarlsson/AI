It's my first semester teaching a general-student Jazz History course, and I wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved.  I bought this video as a &quot;best-of-all-options&quot; choice, and was  bowled over by it's thoroughness and attention to detail.  Everything we'd  discussed about Armstrong during class was there on the tape, reinforcing  my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear AND see the  legendary Louis.  For pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile, but for  instructional purposes I'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz  classes I'd teach.  I paid $16 bucks for it, but having seen it I think  I'd've paid fifty!  (Shh!  Don't tell Amazon!
