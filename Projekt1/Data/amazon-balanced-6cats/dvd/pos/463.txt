WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE FRIENDS SERIES...5 DOWN, 5 TO GO!

The 5th Season of Friends is the season where: 
*Monica and Chandler start their relationship
*Ross gets married...AGAIN to RACHEL out of being very very drunk!
*They pass the 100th episode
Whenever I watch Season Five all I can really say is that it is easily watchable and is quite good, but it isnt my favourite season. For some reason I notice the episodes are kind of all over the place and its not like it used to be. Dont get me wrong I still  love the show and this Season is good, but this one isn't vital. I personally only bought this season for that episode where Monica has a turkey on her head with the big glasses and hat and then dances! I know! Stupid! Lol but its classic!
This season Box set isnt desperately needed in your collection, unless you want to see Monica and Chandler start their relationship and hide it with Joey covering for them constantly (The One With Ross's Sandwich is great when Joey covers for Monica and Chandler!)
The top 5 Episodes are very easy to pick for this particular season. 
My Personal Top 5 Episodes Are:
The One With All The Kissing
The One Hundredth (Has to be here! The 100th!)
The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks
The One Where Everybody Finds Out (BEST HERE!!!!)
The One Where Rachel Smokes

I didnt care much for the Season Finale, I mean, identical hand twin?? Not very funny. Very time wasting!. The only really good thing in the final is The Very Last Scene!!!

Overall, not a stellar season, Not as good as Season 3 or 4 but definitley up there somewhere. Not desperatley needed in your collection, IF ONLY COLLECTING A FEW. Contains some very good episodes. The One Where Everybody Finds Out is a highlight! Check that out
