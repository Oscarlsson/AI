I was never a diehard Huey Lewis fan but this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll. If you're looking for another dvd you can add to your concert collection, this one is worth the price of admission. I'm not familiar with all the original members so just having Huey as the front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as I remembered them, it was memorable, high-energy performance. One little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me. About halfway through the show, Huey's shirt had a meltdown. All of a sudden it looked like he got caught in a major downpour. Am I the only one that noticed this? But it just goes to show the man was giving it all he had. Who could ask for more
