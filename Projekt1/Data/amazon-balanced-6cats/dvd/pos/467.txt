Very entertaining movie. I enjoyed everything about this movie--- the acting, the humor, the singing and storyline!

Also being from San Diego originally, it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark, The Hotel Del Coronado, being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed! No the hotel wasn't The Seminole Ritz in Florida!
