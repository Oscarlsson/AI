I encourage anyone who enjoys Superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun-filled nostalgia, to purchase the entire series of the "Adventures of Superman" (played by George Reeves); the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed DVD's (I got mine all at once in a 3-pack collection, saving a little $$).  This is your chance to view the ENTIRE Superman TV series, from the first episode to the last (prematurely ending with the death of George Reeves)
