There can't be a better storyteller than Teddy Ruxpin. As I child I was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy Teddy Ruxpin as I waited for Saturday morning to come again so I could see another episode of the TV series. This show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one. So many cartoons are just one-shots, an individual small plot for each episode. Teddy Ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure! Along the way, kids learn important morals, values, and a lot about their own world. This is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age. And what a great price! Well worth it!
