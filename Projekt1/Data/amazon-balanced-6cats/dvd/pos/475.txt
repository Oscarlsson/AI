This DVD teaches the history of Tai Chi, and the History of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form. It explains that these two Tai Chi forms were originally a martial art style, and that now they are usually done for health improvement. 

Then it shows the 24 posture form from the front, and the back, and with breathing instructions. Im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements, but when I am, this is a great guide. It then shows each of the 24 postures, and their original martial art applications, which helps you have a strong intent during the posture, and keeps your arms and legs in proper position. THEN, it teaches the 24 posture form, step by step, with very detailed instruction. This is a much more expanded version of this video by Master Liang than the original VHS. 

The DVD also shows the 48 posture form, which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form, and has other movements from other styles. 

It has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average. It has also improved my confidence, and people keep saying I have a glow about me. I just feel healthier, and happier too. 

This DVD is easy to learn from quickly. The Chinese bamboo flute music is nice. Oh, actually, my FAVORITE part is at the end, it shows a 'slideshow' of photos of the master, doing each posture move-by-move, with great music. I like to do my form along to this section, because it is a bit slower than the actual form, and you can exactly match your movements to the master. Its like having a one-on-one class with him. I find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly. I remember the form now, without having to 'THINK', so I can try to turn my attention inward. 

A great DVD
