Flying Down to Rio is the film that marks the first pairing of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The two are not the main attraction though; the film stars Dolores del Rio and Gene Raymond in a tempestuous love affair. Raymond is a band leader who always falls for beautiful women. Del Rio is engaged to a man in Rio de Janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the American. In a back and forth romance, the two occupy plenty of the film. The rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers including "I Like Music," "The Carioca," and "Orchids in the Moonlight" on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus girls dancing on top of airplanes!

The cast is good and the story is pretty standard, but it is the music that spices up the film. Definitly take a look at this movie, which is filled with inuendo only pre-code films could get away with and music only those early musicals featured
