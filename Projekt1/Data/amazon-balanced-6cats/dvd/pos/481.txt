&quot;Monkey Business&quot; looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later.  The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined.  The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout.  Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here.  She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation.  Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth.  His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks!  Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth.  If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings.  Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game.  Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO.  Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films.  This is a great little piece of cinematic history.  Turn back the clock &amp; enjoy
