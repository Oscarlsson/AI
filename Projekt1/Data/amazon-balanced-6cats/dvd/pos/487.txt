Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) arrives from Colorado to Los Angeles. He is an aspiring writer who is getting down to his last nickel. He prays for inspiration to find another interesting story to write.  He meets a mexican waitress, Camilla (Salma Hayek) in a cafe and they just don't like each other, or do they?
  Finally Auturo hits the mother lode. A letter he wrote has been changed into a short story for publishing along with a handsome paycheck.  It is just enough for him to buy a new suit outfit, a few suppers and pay the rent for a while.
  Arturo is a very well mannered man, but keeps meeting these strange characters that get him all wrong.
  Plays like film noir. The cinematography of 1934 Los Angeles is wonderful.
  Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek in the moonlit ocean was breathtaking.
  Colin Farrell perfected his American accent.
  Very tastefully down skinny-dipping scenes and beautiful to watch.
  AH! Give Colin a break. The water was cold.
