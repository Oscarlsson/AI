I really forgot how good some of those first season early episodes were until I bought the season 1 DVD. "Skin Deep" is probably the most entertaining episode of the series. Other standouts are "China Doll" and "J "Digger" Doyle". What I enjoyed most was the 1982 crossover episode as the featuring Gerald McRaney and Jamison Parker from Simon and Simon from season 2. Also the Simon episode "Emeralds are a girls best friend" and although not as big a fan of later seasons, the 2 part season 5 opener w/ a young unknown Sharon Stone playing a psycho...big surprise there. I found it neat with the discoesque theme song for the first 10 episodes too. You could see how the 4 main characters found their niche as the season progressed
