This is a great show and very entertaining.  The story isn't the Greek classic, but it's a fine riff on it.  The songs are good, and they grow on you as you watch.  I take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the Meg character - it's just a cartoon, for pete's sake.

Like some other reviewers, I was also annoyed with Michael Bolton singing "Go The Distance" over the end credits, but this DVD has a music video of the Spanish language version, "No Importa La Distancia," sung by Ricky Martin, and it is killer!  This one is well worth the money
