Briefly speaking,


If you liked Tony Jaa in "Ong-Bak " you'll love 
"The Protector." The plots are cut from the 
same mold (in this movie, Jaa attempts 
to recover elephants, instead of a statue head, 
that were stolen from his village by ruthless criminals). 
The choreography is faster paced 
and more dynamic (and there's more of it!); 
once again showcasing Jaa's fantastic 
martial arts ability.  Since the script 
and the acting are not on the high end of 
the cinema achievement scale, the producers 
were smart to put the emphasis on mindboggling 
stunts and martial arts choreography.

This movie is great. I hope I'm not placing a 
jinx by saying Tony Jaa is destined to become
a legend. He is the greatest martial artist
we've seen on screen in many years.
