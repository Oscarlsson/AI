For those reviewers who have not seen the remakes, see DAIL M FOR MURDER by Alfred Hitchcock, PERFECT MURDER starring Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow, not to mention countless TV movies of the week.

This is the original and the best.Barbara Stanwyck is superb, as is Burt Lancaster. Moody and dark and suspenseful.
