Every time this movie comes on my husband (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.If you have ever been in an English train station,drinking weak,watery cups of tea out of dirty,cracked cups.Smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.And not to be crule,but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.The thought of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their passion for each other is,well------------------ hilarious! I give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.Oh--- and the music---- PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! But it is worth watching for a good laugh
