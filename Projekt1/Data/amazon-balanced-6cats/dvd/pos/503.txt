I enjoyed this movie a lot. Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both very appealing in these roles, and Greg Kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who's just so charming that you can't resist, even when you know better than to fall for it. Ellen Barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first
