This is one of the best movies starring children I have ever seen - Ozu embraces their viewpoint - often litterally from their eye level. Often in other Ozu films like 'Tokyo Story', and 'Early Summer' - we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and, often times, humerous perspective. Now in 'Good Morning' we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood - and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family. Like all Ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions. It is not as masterul as 'Tokyo Story' of 'Floating Weeds' - but it gives us a better understanding of Ozu and how he saw the world - very charming film
