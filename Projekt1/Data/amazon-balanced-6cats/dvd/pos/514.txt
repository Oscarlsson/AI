Well, at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter.  Each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet.  Beware, the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while.  The DVD has a different narrator than the original (Neal Morrissey) videos, but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s
