This would be a steal at twice the price.  I don't know what possessed Spike Lee to offer five of his best movies at such a low price.  Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie, capturing both the rhythms and tensions of Lee's beloved Brooklyn, which he would return to time and again.  Lee is at his best when avoiding the polemics and sticking to character-driven movies.  Jungle Fever and Mo' Better Blues stand out in this regard, because they are first and foremost about people.  Jungle Fever introduced the great Samuel L. Jackson, as well as launched Wesley Snipes in an intense social drama which revolves around an inter-racial love affair.  Jackson stole most of the scenes however as the drug-addled brother who simply couldn't get his act straight no matter how hard he tried.  Mo' Better Blues exposed Lee's love for jazz.  Moody and atmospheric, with Denzel Washington delivering a solid performance, the film tries to recapture the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance.  Clockers was his crime drama with plenty of tension. Crooklyn revolved mostly around amusing family disputes, with Alfre Woodard as a strong mother figure.  It was probably the least satisfying of the five, but fun to watch just the same.  Lee embelishes his movies with such rich cinematic color, and offers numerous fascinating camera angles such as his now famous walking scenes in Jungle Fever.  Not since Gordon Parks, had someone done so much for black cinema, rescuing it from the blaxploitation films of the 70's
