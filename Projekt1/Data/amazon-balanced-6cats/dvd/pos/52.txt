I recently had a baby boy, and felt a &quot;little&quot; out of shape after having him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the weights!I am also learning about my baby's development from the video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB
