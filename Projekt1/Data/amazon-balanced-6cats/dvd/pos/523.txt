Very few people remember Sandra Bullock starring on the short-lived CBS sitcom Working Girl which was based on the 1988 20th Century Fox film of the same title starring Harrison Ford,Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver. Very few remember Bullock's appearance in the 1991 film LOVE POTION #9. This film catapulted her to superstardom. She stars opposite Keanu Reeves and all hell breaks loose with both of them recklessly driving commercial buses. In the twelve years since this film debuted on the big screen,Bullock relentlessly made films to this very day. Also back in 1994,Hollywood had another megastar,Jim Carrey whose starring debut ACE VENTURA-PET DETECTIVE grossed over $5 million at the box office. Unfortunately,SPEED 2,released in 1997,never acuumulated audiences as large as the ones who saw the first film
