Both movies are great, each one of them has it's own charm.
Ashley Judd shows she is a great comedian, and Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors of his generation.  The movie is soo funny...it shows what we women are like when a man breaks up with us, and that love is where you least expect it.
As for Brown Sugar, it's very sweet, entertaining and funny to watch. I didn't know the actors of this movie and they are amazing. Perhaps love is next door
