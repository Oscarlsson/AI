I have very fond memories of this short lived Irwin Allen classic.The picture and sound on the dvd's is better than i remember.The video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono.I give volume one of the "Time Tunnel" five stars for pure television enjoyment.Volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show,The unaired extended version of the pilot,Irwin Allen's behind the scenes home movies, visual effects,camera test,still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots.Once again it is lacking in cast interviews. many of the actors from this show are still alive,so why didn't the studio interview them for the dvd set?.It would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought's on the show.My only gripe is that this show only ran for one season,so why split it into two volumes?.Surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price
