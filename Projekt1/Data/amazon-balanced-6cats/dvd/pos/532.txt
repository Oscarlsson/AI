In the days of the Arcades there was a good movie that came out (and funny enough had a great Arcade game) called Krull. Now mind you, I really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it (when i was a whole bunch younger) just saw the 5 bladed "glaive" and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie (including those terrible scifi D&D movies ugh) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the Slayers and from then on its a totally different experience. with such ultimate favorites as the Emerald Seer, The Widow of the Web and the Cyclops and of course the shapeshifting (a bit daft too) wizard with some very strange habits (i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come.
Pros: cool effects (for the time) good story well done plot and themes

cons: may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough. but remember it is a tad old.
its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great
