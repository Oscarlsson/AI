Lindsay Duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and Liam Cunningham is her well-cast, perfunctory foil. As as the story unfolds, the differences between British and American style (and culture) are revealed, providing a nice subtext to the plot.

But my "best actor" award goes to the photographs themselves: the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once.  A visually rich film
