Loved them all ... found Victoria &amp; Albert and Lorna Doone a bit lacking.  Wondered about having more of The Scarlet Pimpernel offered - he's so smooth!  Tom Jones is very special - loved Sophie's father, he truly made the film.  As much as I liked him - hated Lizzie's mother in P &amp; P - what a ninny!  This is a great collection, would have liked to see Vanity Fair and Persuasion offered also
