My 2 year old loves his video. The animations are unusual but they are full of flare, color and imagination. The songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter can't get enough of them. The main character Moustache, and the rest of the characters, are all well imagined and fun. As far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and I see her using what she has learned all the time, and the semi-interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line. I personally love this video and would recommend it
