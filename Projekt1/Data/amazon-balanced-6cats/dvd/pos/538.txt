This disk collects the two Tales From the Crypt movies on one side of a single disk.  For some reason the menu has the second movie listed first.

In the first movie, Billy Zane is excellent as a demon looking for a final key so that the demons can retake the universe.  This is the story of his battle with the current Demon Knight, the protector of the key.  Wonderfully crafted and dark.

The second movie, Bordello of Blood, is a more tongue-in-cheek T&A-fest and lacks the dark seriousness of the first.  Lilith, the queen of all vampires, has been awakened.  She can be controlled by a key (the one from the first movie).  She has set up a bordello to lure victims to her hunger.  Dennis Miller is his wise-cracking self as he portrays a down-and-out private investigator looking for a missing person.

It is nice not to have to flip the disk over or insert a new disk but there is no room for real extras (we do get the original trailers).  Seeing the two films together really showcases the extreme difference between the two.  The first is dark, well-written and well-acted.  The second is gratuitous, crass and just not quite as good (although it is fun in its own way).  Now they are together at a reasonable price.
