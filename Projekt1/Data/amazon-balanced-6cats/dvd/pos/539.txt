This is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor. It is also a story of cross-cultural misunderstanding of the highest order.  Kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part.  The scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema. The cinematography and editing are a masterpiece. Unforgettable
