This one is an old favorite of mine, which I pre-ordered on DVD the instant I learned it was available.  I have an old VHS recording of the film, which I have viewed many times.  I have also read the book many times, and I consider it to be Conroy's best work.

This is the story of four young men at Carolina Military Institute, a fictional military academy located in South Carolina, which is of course a pseudonym for The Citadel, which is a fine military academy that really does exist.  The film is set in the 1960s.  The first black cadet (first year cadets are called "knobs" at the Institute) has just arrived.  A secret society within the Institute, known as "The Ten" has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the Institute, regardless of ability.

David Keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet's designated mentor.  The plot moves at a fast pace, but nevertheless does not feel rushed.  Purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel.  I feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete, and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries.  

I liked the script, the acting, and the ending.  This is a wonderful film.  It is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years, and I am delighted that it will shortly be available on DVD.
