This movie is truly wonderfully done.  I appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters, and the deep resonances of director Zhang Yimou's commentary on academics in modern rural China.  The language is particularly good for students learning Mandarin Chinese, as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken Chinese in the countryside and in the cities.  There are English subtitles for beginners as well.  I highly recommend it.
