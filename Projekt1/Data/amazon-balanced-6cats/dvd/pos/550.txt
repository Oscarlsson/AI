With King Creole, Love Me Tender and Stay Away Joe - JAILHOUSE ROCK 1957 is Elvis Presley at his best. He declined the old musical tradition of MGM and insisted on a contemparary look - especially how the choreography should be executed.

In this film we see ELVIS PRESLEY at his very best. He was a stunning actor - much more prefer HIM to James Dean...  It`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films.... only a handful stands out and JAILHOUSE ROCK is the best.  It isn`t a classic - it isn`t even great. But we have ELVIS - the KING - and that`s the best there is:-))
