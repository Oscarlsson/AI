To Be or Not To Be is a comedy set during WWII. Although it makes light of a tense time in history, it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease. The story revolves around two actors in Poland, Maria and Joseph Tura. Joseph (Jack Benny) specializes in overplaying Hamlet and Maria (Carole Lombard) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his "To be or not to be" speech. The man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation. Although she is working for the Allies, a Nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause. Madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess.

The film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting. It is a real shame that Carole Lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash; she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne.
