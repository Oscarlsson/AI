The magnificent frame employment, accent even more the claustrophobic atmosphere about a man in an unnamed country, arrested for an unexplained crime he is never told about. The unbearable tension joins with bureaucratic struggle to involve us in a nightmare of uncalculated magnitude. 
Anthony Perkins' emotive memory after Psycho fit with adjusted accuracy. A magnificent cast headed by Jeanne Moreau, Akim Tamirof, Elsa Martinelli and Welles too. 
A fundamental icon of the cinematography. 
Footnote: It should be known that a special request of Welles around a documental that included at least some shots of the Atomic Bomb were totally denied to him. Something similar happened with Kubrick when he asked for flight sequences of the B-52 IN Dr. Strangelove.
