The documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots.  However it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different NATO countries.  The actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered more

The presentation both the picture and sound are top notch.  We found out that not every DVD system can read the IMAX presentation
