In this movie we once again see Mad Max (sans hot car) wandering around in a Post Apocalyptic world until he discovers Bartertown in the Wasteland.Mel Gibson tries valiantly  to channel  such on screen loners as Clint Eastwood  and John Wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social  skills. However he becomes a threat to the Matriarch of the town by the name of Aunty EmTeeVee (or something like that). Then Mel kicks a lot of butt in the process. This is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the Outback Opal Mining Town of Coober Pedy which I visited a few years ago
