200 American is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy. Even though it looks like a no-budget episode of Queer As Folk or intended to be a gay version of Pretty Woman, it's got a pretty good story. It doesn't rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography. Most of the actors are straight playing gay roles. I was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show, something that I can certainly relate to. The acting is acceptable but not great, because most of the actors are not that experienced. I was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer! The movie has some kind of charm about it, perhaps it's because it's so sincere and gimmick free, and even the love scenes are very low-key. I was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss. There is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor, it's very captivating. Sean Matic did a good job with his light Austrilian accent by the way. It's worth rental fee for sure.
