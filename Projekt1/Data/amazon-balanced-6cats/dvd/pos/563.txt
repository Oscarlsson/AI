This is an adorable movie. It's low-budget and the acting is not
spectacular, but nevertheless, it's a cute story with sexy characters and an impressive, unique plot.

Conrad is a successful, attractive man recently heart-broken. Venturing into the unknown, he hires a sex worker for the night. As it turns out, his hired man, Ian, is quite the catch -- a young, charming, sexy Australian trying to save money to stay in the country. Soon enough, Ian is in Conrad's life every day, though not as you may think.

As Ian moves into Conrad's social life, everyone's issues come to the surface. Love stories unfold and redevelop, problems at home collide with life at work, the truth behind Ian's need to do sex work comes out, and everyone is in for a wake-up call about life and what they need.

Basically, it's genuine, it's cute and charming, and it deals with real-life problems, most of which just happen to be gay, a definite plus in my book. So give its budget a break and sit back and enjoy a film well-worth seeing.
