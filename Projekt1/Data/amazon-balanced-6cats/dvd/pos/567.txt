I was more than impressed by this stupendous documentary.  Not only is it superior, photogrqphically speaking -- not only does it have beautiful & inspiring music -- it is factual and should open our eyes to what we have to lose in the name of oil!  We need to understand why environmentalists and educated elected officials care about protecting this pristine area. I was born, raised and educated in one of the most beautiful places in the U.S. in Boulder, CO -- at the foot of the flatirons -- BUT I truly feel this Alaska wilderness is "God's Country."  Buy this DVD -- view it -- invite everyone you care about to view it with you.  You wll begin to care and maYbe -- just maybe -- you will help to preserve it for your children & generations after you are gone
