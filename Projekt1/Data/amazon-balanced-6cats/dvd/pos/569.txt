This film seems to be known worldwide as a "chick flick", from the romantic aspects of it, to the current anniversary DVD's pink cover.

I'm an 18 year old guy who absolutely digs this film, especially due to the Holly Golightly character. After viewing this film for the first time, I developed a crush on the character Holly (kind of goofy, I guess, but it's very hard for me to dislike a character like her.) Audrey Hepburn played her to perfection. The film was also brilliantly shot by Franz Planer and directed by Blake Edwards. I love the film's dialogue as well, it has a very realistic quality, and it's so fun to hear the characters converse with each other.

"Breakfast At Tiffany's" is perhaps the best "date" movie ever conceived.  This film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age.
