I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns.

The instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image.

I teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves.

And, you will work up a sweat, if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march.  Enjoy
