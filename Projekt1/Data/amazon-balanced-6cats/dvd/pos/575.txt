For Ina Claire NINOTCHKA was a last chance to show posterity what she could do, for there wouldn't be many film opportunities offered her.  She'd been a leading lady of the stage for nigh on thirty years, and her elegant beauty, very much a high-bred Dina Merrill type look, was still aglow. She was one of Carl Van Vechten's favorite subjects and he took photo after photo of her, staring imperiously against a wall of baize, or reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde hair.

She suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at MGM, when her part in I TAKE THIS WOMAN was taken away from her and given to the cheaper Verree Teasdale.  Her director, Josef Von Sternberg was also let go, and in fact the whole picture was redone so many times studio wags called it I RE-TAKE THIS WOMAN!  The "woman" in question was Hedy Lamarr; after Ina Claire's hilarious showdowns with Garbo in NINOTCHKA, the studio might have thought her perfect for the part of Lamarr's Central European rival.  A year or so later, and Edmund Goulding put her to work as Dorothy McGuire's mother in the charming, underrated CLAUDIA, but that is definitely a mother part and as such, put an end to Ina Claire's film career.

As the countess "Swana" she gets lots of Billy Wilder's best lines and laughs.  She's not afraid of anyone, much less Garbo.  Much has been written about the chemistry between Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, indeed a delightful mix, but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without Swana's steely, icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations.

In real life Ina Claire lived on to a great old age.  She was 92 when the last curtain fell for her, and here in San Francisco, where she spent most of her life, all the lights in her building went off for an hour, precisely at 8:30, while her fans stood on the street, devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans surrounding the Dakota Hotel when John Lennon died
