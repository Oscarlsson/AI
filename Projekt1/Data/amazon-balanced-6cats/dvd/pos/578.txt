This DVD contains three episodes of "Bear in the Big Blue House." The first two have a birthday party theme. The final one doesn't really anything to do with a party, but it is still rocking.

The fun starts with "Mouse Party" when our friends in the Big Blue House put together a surprise party for Tutter the mouse. The viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations, making the cake and keeping Tutter in the dark. Tutter considers the fact that he's getting older and finally, viewers rock to "Happy, Happy Birthday" when the time comes for Tutter's big party.

Next comes "Bear's Birthday Bash." This is an episode that recalls "Mouse Party" in many ways, except this time it's Bear who's having the birthday. He'd like to have a nice, relaxing day, but the kids of the Big Blue House decide to throw him a surprise party.

Finally, "Dancin' the Day Away" finds everyone in the Big Blue House having some fun with dance. Tutter, however, doesn't think that he can dance, but Pip and Pop show him that he really can.


This is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories. My favorites are Tutter and Ojo (and the big old Bear himself), but they're all wonderful. This DVD includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs
