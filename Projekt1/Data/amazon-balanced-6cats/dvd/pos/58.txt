Following the series of Firefly, Serenity continues the story line for a few  more steps.  There are so many ways this movie is packed I cannot begin to properly mention them here.  The storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a "solving the mystery" approach.  The english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand- mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing.  The animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality.  The characters are complex, focused, solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations.  The challenges the crew of Serenity face are many: from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority "Alliance" forces to the overt mortal threat of the "Reavers".  The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue.  The music in Serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more.  I suggest seeing the series Firefly before watching the movie Serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters
