Funny thing to mention here is that the stated region block (region 1) isn't really present. I took the shot to order this and unlock my DVD player if I had to (I live in Amsterdam, region 2) but I didn't have to!! This DVD is region free! Thanks Amazon, but in future it would be nice to provide correct region-information. I bet that a lot European (and perhaps Australian, Russian and so on) customers cancel their order because of the region code not corresponding with their country region.
