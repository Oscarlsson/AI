As any visual footage on Ike & Tina Turner is pretty scarce, I guess we may be thankful for this great DVD. Their 1971-show being integrally covered by Dutch television, it reveals Ike & Tina supported by a pretty good band and, last but not least, by the marvellous Ikettes. All this at a time their performance must have been at its very peak.
