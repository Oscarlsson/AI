The casting here was excellent - Ben Stiller, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Jessica Parker were all great. In fact, I am convinced that Elle Macpherson can act because of the 3 movies I have now seen her in, she plays decidedly different people in each one. She is perfectly cast as Joe's dream woman. I found Eric Schaeffer's character the least appealing of the whole cast. Some of the jokes here are wildly funny.  The audience is never given a clue that the Jane Lindquist character is only getting involved with Joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her. I thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually, but was not interested in a relationship with him. Earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships, people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants. That part did not make sense. This could have been improved by some better writing and better character development. The humor here is what makes this worth watching
