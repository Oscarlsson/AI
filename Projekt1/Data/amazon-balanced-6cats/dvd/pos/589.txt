I grew up with the original DS.  I also saw the two "spin off" movies: "House of Dark Shadows" and "Night of Dark Shadows."  Needless to say I was extremely excited about the "revival," and I wasn't disappointed.  I felt that Dan Curtis was actually able to improve upon the original, by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove.  The original Barnabus was played by Jonathan Frid who was a Shakespearian trained actor and, Ben Cross is a member of the Royal Shakespearian Theatre in London.  I loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual, which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth.  And I must say this series lived up to my every expectation.  Dan Curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera.  I looked forward to 3:30 every day after school.  It's too bad that the Gulf War killed it.  Yes it did!  I was there.  After the Sunday, Monday miniseries, that Friday was to air the first "episode."  However it was pre-empted by coverage of the War.  Too, too bad.  I taped it, but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over.  I am so glad to know that I can order it now in it's magical entirety.  I'm ordering it right now!  Thank you Amazon!!!!!!!

If you are a fan of things that go bump in the night, you will LOVE this series!!!!
