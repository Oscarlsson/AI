This Minnesota-filmed movie reportedly has a cult-following, 
and the reason is not far to realize.  Joe Mazzello.  Joe is a 
1990s and 21st century motion-picture phenomenon.  His presence
in this movie is so REALISTIC and life-life that you forget that
he is acting.  He was pivotal in carrying this movie.  How so?
May I add that Joe's axiom for acting is simply:  "Just make it look Real!" He achieved this to a stellar degree in "The Cure," and also in the later fare: "Simon Birch".  Incredible acting, and I know good acting, for I was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical
score for it.  No, I am not going to name-drop.

The Cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social/geographical/educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly
forged and may I add that it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern, honest caring, and warm affection. No matter how many times I watch it, tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film.  
Joe is the best!
