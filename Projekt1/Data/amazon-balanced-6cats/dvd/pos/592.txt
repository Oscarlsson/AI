VHS - I have watched this over and over and LOVED every minute of it so much so I have now ordered the DVD I only wished the film could have lasted longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever.  Make up your own mind and don't let others put you off!  I have all Jane Austen's BBC series but this is my FAVOURITE.
