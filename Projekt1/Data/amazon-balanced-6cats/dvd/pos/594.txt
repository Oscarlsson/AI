This movie classic, is a fabulous movie.  The story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young people whose parents are immigrants.
Here is this sensitive, kind-hearted fellow, Marty, a butcher, who just wants to meet a nice girl and get married. Nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life, especially his mother, and his aunt.  These two actors play their character parts perfectly, just like real "battle-axes" from the "old country,"  etc.  They gossip and try to ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met. It is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life.  I love watching this movie over and over
