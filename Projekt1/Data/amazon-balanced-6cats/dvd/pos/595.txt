Alfred Hitchcock's second film after being brought to America by David O. Selznick was SUSPICION, which he made while on loan to RKO Pictures. As in his first Hollywood flick, REBECCA, he put Joan Fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star.

Fontaine won the Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Lina McLaidlaw, a bookish and innocent (but wealthy) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). After their quick courtship and marriage against her father's wishes, Lina begins to see Johnnie for who he really is--a penniless leech--but she naively continues to love him nonetheless. Johnnie's charm is ostensible, yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable. Lina's trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts.

Hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture. The movie's only flaw is its tacked-on and seemingly contrived final scene which, we are told, was due either to Mr. Grant's popularity during these years or to the existence of the Production Code in effect in Hollywood at that time. Hitchcock wanted a darker ending but, as we see here, he lost that battle. However, he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe. The ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities.

SUSPICION is classic Hitchcock. Grant and Fontaine turn in masterful performances and Nigel Bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable "Beaky," Johnnie's old chum. The flawed ending prevents placing SUSPICION at the top of any list of Hitchcock's achievements, but it is a fine film nevertheless and I can only give it my highest recommendation.
