I'm not usually a ballet person.  I haven't seen anything since "The Nutcracker" when I was six.  But this was absolutely brilliant.  The concept for it is completely bold and original and Adam Cooper as The Swan blew me away.  How can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop?  Tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this, but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet.
