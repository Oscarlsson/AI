This movie has more magic than a wand. This movie is a story about having faith in your beliefs. Young Jessica is so sure that this reindeer is Prancer she is willing to go to extremes to help save her friend. Sam Elliot plays a tough dad who wants to have faith in his only daughter but is scared of losing her and his farm. This a wonderful classic for the young and old.
