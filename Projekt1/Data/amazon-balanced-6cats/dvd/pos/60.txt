I've been doing this DVD workout for two years, and I still can't make it all the way through the "level 2" workouts.  This video is incredibly challenging, but I like that I can do the "level 1" workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day.  No other DVD can accomplish what Tamilee does in 15 minutes.  This really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time.  I am always sore the next day when I do her workouts.  This is a great DVD
