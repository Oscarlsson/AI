The movie is excellent.  I was hoping to find the directors cut with additional footage, but the regular DVD is excellent as well.  Not many additional features, but the movie is delightful and, although slightly longer then some, holds the viewers interest.  Minor amounts of nudity, some very graphic fist fighting, but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot.  One of Ron Howard's best films
