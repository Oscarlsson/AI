These films used to be on TV all the time. I was amazed at how clever the plots were. I didn't remember some of them. "Weird Woman" is my favorite "B-film" and I'm always recommending it to people. Movies used to be so entertaining ! It's great to have this collection available to film fans. We can overlook Chaney's stiffness, as the rest of the cast really compensates for it
