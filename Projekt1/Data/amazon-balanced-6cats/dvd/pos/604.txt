I own both the ultimate Editon and the Extreme DVD. I want to say that you can play the Theatrical version on your T.V with the Two-Disc Extreme Special Edition, on your menu on disc it should say play special Edition, hit right four times and "the future is not set" should be highlighted, push enter and you should see "play theatrical version on your menu. I am a little dissipointed that when I bought the Extreme DVD at Best Buy it did not have a metal case. Either way I love T2, it's a classic that never gets old
