When people talk about buddy-buddy films this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast, Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself wanders off in various directions until it comes home with unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile Bridges.Like "Collateral," where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long while.
