Daniel Day-Lewis must be the most versatile film actor in the world. He looks like a different person in almost every film he makes. I assume that's the real Day-Lewis in this flick about the rebellion in Northern Ireland, revenge and absolution. His romantic interest, Emily Watson, puts in a good performance too. Day-Lewis looks a lot different than he did in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; but he is just as compelling in his performance. I thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with its somewhat Hollywood finale, but otherwise I enjoyed it. If you like substantial filmmaking, good acting, great drama, unfamiliar vistas and a good story, you'll enjoy it too
