This is an honestly forgivably slightly too long film that manages to be surprisingly crass with three dimensional characters and capture much of war's bad brutality (but necessity hey the men and women set fire to are all deranged nazis). I love the scenes best where Sutherland plays a general and the part where the english chicks show up at sort of dance with the dozen (interesting if English Jill Ireland had been one of the ladies there--with Charles Bronson looking at her-- which she wasn't---but the mostly hot chicks they have do just fine). Before I saw the film I heard Ernest Borgnine was in the movie and I thought he was going to be one of the dozen. There is no really solidly likable member of the dozen (Sutherland's probably the closest they come to this and he is rather undeveloped) and Borgnine could have fit the bill very nicely had he been a convict--instead they've got him in a more dull role of a general. But what the dozen lack in likability they make up for in interest. Cassavettes (whom I strongly physically resemble by the way) is outstanding as the most crooked but slickest member of the dozen and he shines best. Savalas is next best as the lust hating psycho (hey sex between men and women is needed to produce babies, Telly, or the human race would have ceased to exist a long time ago and the book of Genesis talks of man and woman becoming one). Bronson is the true chameleon of an actor as just 8 years later he'd be the very different vigilante Paul Kersey of Death wish so different than the very tough but still gentler fellow he plays here. Marvin brilliant in the lead as the head major leading the dozen(probably even better than the very good John Wayne would have been). Nice turn by Bob Ryan as a decent colonel who rather understandably makes things hard for the covert dozen. The rest of the cast is mostly very good too. Very good film!
