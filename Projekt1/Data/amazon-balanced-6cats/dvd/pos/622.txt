This was a very interesting movie.  A friend told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked the movie The Skeleton Key.  I think I liked The Skeleton Key better... but this was still a really good movie.  There are a few scenes with nudity in it.  Not a movie for the youngsters. We had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.  A good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing
