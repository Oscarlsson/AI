With season 4 the series starts to slide a little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours! That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't too big a let down. For those who are interested the DVD set has great transfers, but few interesting extras
