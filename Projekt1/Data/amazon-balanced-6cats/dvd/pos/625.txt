For sheer excitement, you cannot beat this DVD.  The music is exciting, arranged well for brass ensemble, and recorded with high quality.  But that's only the beginning...

In Blast, the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform.  How they manage this energy level will flat-out amaze you.  I can honestly say that, after just seeing these performances, you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be.

Prepare to be thrilled..
