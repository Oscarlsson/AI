The essence of painter Francis Bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life.  Seen through his central nervous system and eyes, we experience  his world of fragments, like collage pieces of existence.  The only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting. Otherwise, he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being, himself, together.  Tellingly, one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job with his lover George in his paintings of George.  However, he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with George!  That sums up Bacon, his art and his life, in a nutshell.  Bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art.  Yet he is also the most alone person imaginable, something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay.  One of the very best films about an artist ever made.  You don't need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here.  If you want to see his paintings, you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute, or less, using any visual search engine
