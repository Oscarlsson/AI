I think Pauly Shore is much more talented then people give him credit for.  It is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films.  But the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made.  Frankly I dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career, I think he probably knows that he is a living joke, I feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and I'd say hes done that
