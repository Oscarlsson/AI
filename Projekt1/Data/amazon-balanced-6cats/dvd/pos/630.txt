One of the most compelling events of the release of Kenneth Lonergan's You Can Count On Me is that it gave visibility to Mark Ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who, unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash, lives of life of unattached agony and isolation. He's a loner and a drifter, medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships. His sister Sammy, played wonderfully by Laura Linney, reacts to the same tragedy by being, in many ways, an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom. Two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash. This film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight, the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another. The ride is never easy in this film. No easy answers are given. Just as important, this film, which deals with the pain of loss, never descends into the maudlin Hallmark movie sap that other films would. Balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight, Lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss. Amazingly, he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic. Matthew Broderick, for example, plays a hilarious role of Sammy's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank. The conflict between him and Sammy leads to a plot point that I'll let you discover in the film.

But most of all, this film shines because Mark Ruffalo plays such an endearing, sympathetic, sometimes infuriating character. You won't forget him
