Orange County as a movie tries to play it safe. The Director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a good film. I must say for around 50% of the film I was laughing. Jack Black is truly my favourite character in the film. Colin Hanks,the lead actor, is a boring sophisticated person.He also plays Black's brother in the film.

Although Jack Black doesnt have a huge role in it, everytime he's on the screen I seem to forget all the other characters around. I thought the scene in which he jumps into the swimming pool with just his under-shorts was funny. But I defintely feel there are some seven other scenes featuring this master of crazy comedy.

I didnt find Colin Hanks(in the film) inspiration inspiring at all and think he should have gone to Stanford.For the simple reason I believe he didnt have much enough at Orange County to wait for.But then that's a story flaw or story strength(however you perceive it) Come to think of it Colin Hanks character was extremely realistic,polite and believable.Now all the credit in the world to the director for this.However,it was the drugged Jack Black who really tries to get him into something.

Ive seen School Of Rock and I'm sorry for I did not like it as much as I liked Orange County.It's the presence of Jack Black that does it for me.I've seen the film 4 times which is probably why I can't stand Hanks and his goodness.

Anyhow,forget all that , watch the film - rent it , steal it, buy it,download it....just give it a watch.

Cheers
