This film is one big joke:  you have all the basics elements of romance (love at first sight, great passion, etc.) and gangster flicks (brutality, dagerous machinations, the mysterious don, etc.), but it is all done with the crudest humor.

It's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately "get" or you don't.  That is a matter of taste and expectations.  

I enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s, when Nicolson and Turner were in their primes.  The acting is very good, if a bit obviously tongue-in-cheek.
