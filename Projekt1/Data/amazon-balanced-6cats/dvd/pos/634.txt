The special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period--there's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done. Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer perfection. It's too bad that Doris didn't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like Carol Burnett.
