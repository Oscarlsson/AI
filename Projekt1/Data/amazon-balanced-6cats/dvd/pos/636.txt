I'm probably going to invest in a re-order of this DVD collection, because I simply have worn this one out. From the "They Call It Pro Football" opening to final gun of Super Bowl X, this collection grips your attention and never lets go. The writing is superb - I especially like NFL 68' - and The highlights... Well, it was when pro football was pro football. 

It was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships, as was the Case with the Dallas Cowboys of the late 60's- Early 70's. "Next Year's Champions" were the epitome of resiliency.  

"The Championship Chase" was a pure joy to view. If ever there was a peak in John Facenda's narrative career with NFL Films, this was it; though in the alternative, I loved his voice-overs in Super Bowls III, IV, VII, and IX.  

Ed and Steve Sabol Really hit the bulleye with Blair Motion Pictures. I would have loved to see more AFL highlights, but that's just nit-picking. 

GREAT JOB!!!
