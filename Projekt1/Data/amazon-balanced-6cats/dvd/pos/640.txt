The Wolf Man Legacy set a no brainer.Like all the classic Universal Legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone. Jack Pierce's Make up and Wolfman Creation are still the best! This set along with Dracula and Frankenstein Legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with. You still need Abbott and Costello meets Frankenstein to truely complete the series
