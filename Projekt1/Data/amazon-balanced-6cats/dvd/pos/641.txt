I don't understand why there are so many low reviews here. This movie was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Also, it was very unique. I think that too many people are trying to project these actions in real life. This movie is FICTION. All the people who gave this movie a bad review should stop trying to see what's real about this movie and just sit back and laugh. This movie was extremely funny!!
