I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, "Interiors" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.  

Woody Allen's greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves.  His characters have faults that we share.  Whatever passions that we have fallen prey to, we see them in a new light through Allen's masterful script and direction.  The problem with "Interiors" is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in "Interiors" have.  Many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us.  Woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by Ingar Bergman.  Allen's own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it.  

Taken in its' own right, "Interiors" is an above-average movie.  The acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner.  The movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess.  These people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other Woody Allen cast (with the bumbling exception of the cast of "What's New Pussycat?").  

Woody Allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way.  Fortunately, he learned from his experience.
