The story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with Mitchum in one of his nastiest roles. It's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in CAPE FEAR. He meets his match in Lillian Gish's character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is "sweet". In fact, the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film. Charles Laughton, in his only stint at directing, does an excellent job but I think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension. A very good example of film noir
