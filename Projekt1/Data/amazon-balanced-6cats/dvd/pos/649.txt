This is a fantastic version of TAMING OF THE SHREW.  For anyone who is interested in really studying the text (and hearing it spoken correctly), this is the version for you!  The actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying - (yipee!) They also have an uncanny way of "speaking the speech" which gets it across to the audience as clear as day.  You dont need to understand 'Shakespearean verse' to see this performance.  The actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast - which I belive they are!
