This is the 2000 or so version of the DVD.  This is identical with the VHS version, except it adds two features.  The first is an excellent "Making Of" video from 1996 -- which was re-done with a different host for 2006, but all the "interview" segments are the same.  The second was a "Making Of" video done for the DVD, which doesn't add a whole lot.

Were I to do it again, I'd buy this version, and skip the 2006 "50th anniversary" release.  This is the classic Chuck Jones television "Grinch", in one of the best packages for it.

And the "Horton Hears A Who" is also a Chuck Jones classic.  "A person's a person, no matter how small."
