My 2 yr old daughter has been watching the Einstein movies (baby&little) since she was born. We just got this and the second she saw it come in the mail she was running around the house excited, not able to wait for her 5 yr old brother to get home to watch it. She has all the Little Eistein movies except for the one that has the ones from the tv show. She watches them almost everyday and loves when she gets a new one. These are great movies for little kids to learn. She has be larger vocabulary then most 2 yr olds. Little Einstein is a great way for children to learn about a variety of things before they start school.
