One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ... as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare with people of differing points of view.  I was expecting mostly the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.   My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now:

"God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't, then he is not God and we need not worry."  

Why people so infrequently ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense to their hearts or not, I don't know.  And when I heard these words coming from the screen, I realized "someone out there understands ... we don't find God in books or doctrine or sermons ... we know God in our hearts, or not at all".  This character looked to his heart and knew ... God will understand ... and anyone who doesn't is surely not God, no matter what someone else might claim. 

And if you loved the movie, you'll enjoy this DVD ... it's a classy widescreen handling of a film that's visually rich and deserves to be seen in it's cinematic format. With gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming, I can't imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form.
