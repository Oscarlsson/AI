I was like the previous reviewer.  I had rented it and after watching it the first time, purchased it before I had even returned the rental!  I loved the content, it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience.  How lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine, waiting to be returned to.  And I didn't learn this fact from the video, I have been studying this subject for many years and already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on Earth.  

This video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that wonderful place that is our true Home.  People who are dying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come.  My own Mother saw her Mother as she died.  She came to take her Home.  There is no specific religion addressed here, only the fact that there is more to life than living and dying.  And that it is something to be totally unafraid of.  In fact physical death is only the beginning of something great; it is a step in the evolution of our souls
