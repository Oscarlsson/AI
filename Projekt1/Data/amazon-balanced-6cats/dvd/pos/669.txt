My sister and I loved this show growing up (The Huxtables reminded us of our extended family!) The episode where Stevie Wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best episodes (in my opinion).  

..I do question why in Amazon's list of actors at the top of the page (for the Season 2 set)...Joseph C. Philips is the only one listed.  Although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later.  Regardless, this is a great collection and a must for Cosby fans.
