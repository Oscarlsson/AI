Wow, how nice to watch Sam Cooke's story from beginning to end. Interviews with the family adds a wealth of inside information. I never knew Sam's father was a Chicago minister and of course Sam was the younger one who surprised the family when he first sang! Unfortunate for music that his life was taken so early. After watching this DVD, I bought Sam Cooke music and surpised that some songs are songs I had no idea Sam wrote
