I echo most of the previous reviews.
This Hayley Mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent Mary Stewart novel that it shares some of its title with.  Hayley was too young to be the novel's heroine, and so for this film the plot and romance were 'youthened', sanitized (though the novel's romance was also chaste) and also very much dumbed down.  As a featherweight Hayley Mills film, this is harmless, and very much a lesser- Disney film of the 60s.  Just don't expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it, even with your kids of today, as a retro laugh
