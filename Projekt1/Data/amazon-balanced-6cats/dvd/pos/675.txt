In 2 weeks, I will actually be at the Vatican for my first visit.This wonderful DVD showed me places and things that I will never be able to see as a tourist, but just knowing about the workings of the Vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit.  This is a beautifully done 90 min DVD as only National Geographic could have done.  I was thrilled with every minute I spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when I get home --- to remember my trip.
