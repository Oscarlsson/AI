What can a single lie do?  That is the question that is examined in Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour.

Martha (Shirley Maclaine) and Karen (Audrey Hepburn) run a small boarding school in a small New England town.  Karen is engaged to a local doctor (James Garner).  When Karen punishes a malicious student, the little girl decides to get revenge.  The way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by Martha's aunt (Miriam Hopkins).  To complicate matters, she blackmails another girl (Veronica Cartwright) into confirming the story.

This lie immediately destroys the Martha and Karen's school.  But their life's are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected.  But when the lie exposed it is too little too late.

When the play opened in the late 50's it was daring and very controversial.  When the film opened in 1961, it was still controversial.  But 40 years later, it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed.

Hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an Oscar nomination if she hadn't made Breakfast at Tiffany's that year.  Shirley Maclaine was fresh off her success in The Apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs.  She proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy.  But it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role (The Turning Point).

Fay Bainter and Miriam Hopkins were major character actors in the 30's and 40's and were given one final chance to show what they had left.  Bainter received an Oscar nomination for this film.

William Wyler had nothing to prove in the 60's yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles.  This was another triumph for him.
