With the flip of a coin , it's home I go. Ichi returns to the town he was raised as a child only to find that much has changed since he last left. A good film in the series I gave it five stars because I am bias and think that they all deserve five. This one was a strong introduction into Ichi's personal life along with the background of villians and lost ruffians with little or no way to reedeem their karma. Of course the cane sword is revealed yet again which leads to some good gore. I thought this was an all around good story with lots of underlying plays on greed and deception, and above all ,love ,shame and guilt from Ichi whom never seems to want to be bothered after it all goes down. Much is lost to our friend Ichi and he seems to just lose more.
