Many, many years ago when I was a very young woman, I saw my first Carry On movie and went to see every one I could possibly get to.  Then, there were none.  Several years ago, my sister taped a copy of Carry On Cleo for me. I couldn't believe I still roared at the silliness only the Brits can successfully pull off.  It must have been fate that led me to look up "Carry On" on amazon a few months ago.  My heart skipped a beat when The Carry On Collection came up.  I instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times.  My personal favorites:  Carry On Constable, Carry On Cowboy, and Carry On Cabby.  But they are all good.  I've loaned several movies to a Brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the Carry On series and who is now introducing them to his American family.  They love them, too.  If you love double-entendre done to perfection, don't miss this collection
