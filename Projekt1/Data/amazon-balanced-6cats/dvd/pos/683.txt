Alec Baldwin has always been the best host of SNL (along with Walken and Spacey) and this makes a pretty good case why.

The opening sketch with the press conference about Prince Charles is priceless.  And what could be more demented than "Canteen Boy."  Baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a really, really sick joke is actually funny.

But the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time: The Tony Bennet Show (I was seizing during this one), The Joe Pesci Show (with Baldwin doing DeNiro) and the "Zinger" sketch, which just got funnier as it went along.  Even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting, only to listen back to it and hear a gay man.

There are a couple of clunkers: "Planet Truth" was just not that funny and maybe two others didn't need to be here.  Including one so-so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included Paul McCartney.

The bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on-air, and a great audio track by Baldwin and the Producer of SNL which provides lots of really, really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves.

Absolutely hilarious
