Alec Baldwin is tied with John Goodman for the second highest appearing host of all time.  So it's only natural that he now has a best of DVD.  This is not the best SNL DVD, but it is still a VERY good one.  If you already have the best of Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks... get this one next.  This DVD has a couple of not-so-good skits, but it makes up for every one.  There are a lot of hilarious skits on the DVD.  I'm not going to list them, but just trust me.  Anyone who gives this less than four stars is OUT OF THEIR MIND.  When I first saw that the Best of Alec Baldwin was out I didn;t have to give it a second thought.  It was at the top of my list, and it should be at the top of yours too.
