I have now seen about twenty Asian horror films, and this series definitely ranks among the best.  I have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a Disney romance.  Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent.  This film maker has something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.  

In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this series
