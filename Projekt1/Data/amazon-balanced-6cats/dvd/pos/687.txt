I really loved this dvd. There is some information for everybody, beginners as well as advanced. There is also a nice presence from Paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album. I was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing. This dvd, without being too personnal, made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man. 
I also enjoyed the discovery of the South-African music, their traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of that country. The many footages of the countryside were a pleasure, which worked perfectly with "Graceland" songs. 
The anecdotes are meaningful, witty, funny, deep, depending on the situation. None of them self-indulgent or egotistical. This DVD is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk composer's. I would rank this DVD up there with "The Clash, West way to the world" and
"U2, the making of the Joshua tree".
