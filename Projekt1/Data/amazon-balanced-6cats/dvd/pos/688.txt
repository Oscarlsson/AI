This was my first yoga cd and i found it amazing ... i'm addicted to it. I still cant tell whether its challenging for advanced yogis but as a beginner I really enjoyed it.... it does NOT have all that gibberish spiritual blab on one extreme nor power yoga that seems to really be pseudoyoga on the other extreme .. however this CD is just clear and to the point with good instruction excellent demonstration and fantastic sound tracks.... eric's voice is soothing the instructions are clear and the crew is great. the length is convenient 45 minutes and music is hypnotic. the more i use it the more i feel stronger increase flexibility, breathe more calmly and improve my posture.. in other words dont hesitate just GET IT!!!!!
