I watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless!

I really dont know what to think about the whole presentation. The presence of Chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows, he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not.

I had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4. The material is more plausible than otherwise
