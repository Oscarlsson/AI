In my 1-3-2007 review of the Harry Potter DVD series, I said about Alfonso Cuarón's direction of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that "perhaps Cuarón held back from doing his own thing" because Chris Columbus had directed the previous Harry Potter releases and had oversight to Azkaban. Well the notion that Cuarón was holding back in his Potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of Men.

Cuarón can indeed make a great movie and could have made Azkaban great...but it was just good. Greatness clearly shines through when Cuarón is turned loose with "his own" film, and Children of Men is a good example. 

Children of Men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith. And this is apparently what Cuarón does best (see 2001 directorial of Oscar nominated Y Tu Mamá También). 

In Children of Men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born. The result? Chaos. Clearly the end of the World is near. Zombies might as well have taken over the Earth, and it was that zombie movie (you know, the good ones, like 28 Days Later [2002] or Dawn of the Dead [2004]) desperation that I was reminded of throughout Children of Men.

Cuarón adapts P.D. James' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties, but keeps the message pretty much the same. The story is believably told, and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through. 

Clive Owen leads the cast, and this guy just gets better and better in every film that I see him in. He's supported by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in A-list performances.

A fair amount of action. Suspense. A very well-told story....Everything that you need to keep you entertained. And, hey, did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for Children of Men? You don't get that too often anymore.
