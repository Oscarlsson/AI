For those of you who only saw the new film last year (I bought it with this sight unseen because it looked interesting and it allowed me to get my favorite free shipping deal) here's your chance to see the Original stories of Flicka and her son Thunderhead.  These 3 films which I am told are pretty faithful to Mary O'Hara's novels of the same titles (I have them too but never read them).  The main difference between them and the 2006 remake is that is the central character is named "Ken (rather thank Katy McLaughlin", well at least the kept the same name in the remake) and is played by a young Roddy McDowell in the first 2 films and Robert Arthur in the third.  The reason he probably didn't do "Green Grass" is that the same year (1948) he was making the second big screen version of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped.  The first film was released on VHS years ago, and both the first 2 had been previously released on DVD to celebrate their 60th anniversaries.  Unfortunately those discs are out of print, albeit some Amazon sellers are still offering them separately or together.  But the copies in this set are exactly the same discs, except for the pictures on the jackets and the labels on the discs.  The text on the back of the boxes and list of chapter stops (on the lists and discs) are exactly the same as the previous releases.  This is also the only way to get all 3 (if you don't count the old copies) as only the first film has been re-released as a separate item (it also marks the first appearance of "Green Grass" on video in any way, shape or form).  By the way, it was also made into the a short lived tv series in 1956 which I doubt we will ever see again.  If you like the books and movies of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and Walter Farley's Black Stallion and the 2006 remake interests (or interested you), get this set before they go out of print again.
