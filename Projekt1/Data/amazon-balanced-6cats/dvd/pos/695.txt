I have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto DVD--it is here! A very good movie. 

I have to say the Inspector Carson (belonging to an unknown federal agency), character played by Kurtwood Smith is good if not great acting. 

He epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate. 

His lines in the movie (particularly when he and Border Patrol Agent Bobby Logan, Kris Kristofferson) discuss 'politics' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best. The conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra....

Great bit part acting by Rip Torn, Roberts Blossom (as the desert rat), Tess Harper and the young and sultry Jean Smart.

Kris Kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and Treat Williams does ok as well.

Anyone who has been in law enforcement--or any other supervisory capacity for that matter--has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the Border Patrol: Totally inept.

The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes. A must see movie.
