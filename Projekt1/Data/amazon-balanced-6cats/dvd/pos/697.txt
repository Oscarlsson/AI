Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or video.  You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up features and Sam's home movies.  The only reason I did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO special.  Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today.  He will really be thought of as a comedy legend.  These DVD's will crack you up.  I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately?  The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison.  He is one of the best, and you will be satisfied with with any purchase.  Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you will be hooked
