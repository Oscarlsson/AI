Having only seen Seinfeld's series on TV that goes by the same name, it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on DVD.

I'd never seen the DVD before, but some of the material sounded familiar... Perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the Seinfeld show?

You may notice that in his speel about the Chinese he lets the word "shovel" out too soon (when talking about the Chinese's perseverance with chopsticks), and thus spoils the joke a little bit.  But Seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib, so he managed to work around it.

A thoroughly recommendable DVD
