Noel and Liam and Jarvis are f*&king hilarious...Damon needs to off himself...same with the weirdo journalist with the upper-class accent...this video is good at making Britpop seem like an actual period in music...hahahahaha...whatever...besides, everyone knows Radiohead and Prodigy were quite accepted in the U.S. and were very original...Oasis is an awesome, lethal rock n roll band, anyone who loves rock n roll have to love Oasis...don't cheat yourself..
