Shel Natowsky, Ph.D.

This movie is Costner's best, without any hesitation. The performances by Hackman and Sean Young are also flawless. Supporting roles are well honed, as well. The movie has everything you could want in a film...I mean everything! The screenplay is wonderfully written, acted, directed, and presented.

Why is it that movies as superb as this one is cannot be made anymore? Everytime I run it, it never ceases to thrill me and to amaze me. If you want to see a Cold War drama that never ceases to excite and one which moves at a fever's pace, then see this one. Satisfaction guaranteed! Well done people
