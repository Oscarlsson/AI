The real life base (Dr. Li Ching-Yun, 1677-1933) adds to the wonder and mystery. Many movies usually pale compared to the book; however this movie fits all the criteria of a great classic. Such as excellent film footage for the time, even though some scenes are missing. When I look at the Shangri-La setting some times my mind wanders and I wonder if this was the idea behind the valley in the book "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand? 

I doubt that they could have picked any better actors for the parts. These actors fit the time and surroundings and were actually believable in the characters they played. A later remake of this movie was o.k. But just did not have the presence of these actors.
 
Now the DVD features: 
Digitally remastered Audio & Anamorphic Video 
Production Notes 
Restoration Before and After Comparison 
Three Deleted Scenes 
Photo Documentary with narration by Historian Kendall Miller 
Many more 

By the way I personally enjoy watching and re-watching this movie.
