It's not a conflict of good and evil that drives MILLIONS (Fox), but rather issues of what's right and wrong.

Set in the UK, this exquisite family film about two brothers, serious seven year old Damien and fun-loving nine year Anthony, who recently lost their mom and discover a suitcase full of British Pounds has dropped out of the sky and crashed into their playhouse.  And it's only seven days before the official currency switches to Euros.  

The brothers think it came from God and they have differing agendas: Spend it on themselves or give it to the needy.  

But the money, on a train to incinerators, was tossed by crooks to accomplices and they want the missing bag back. Millions is funny, scary and profound.  You may even discover things about yourself you never before considered. 

Rated: PG.  Genre: Family Drama/Comedy.  1 Hour, 38 Minutes.  Starring: James Nesbitt, Daisy Donovan, Alex Etel, Lewis McGibbon.  Director: Danny Boyle.
