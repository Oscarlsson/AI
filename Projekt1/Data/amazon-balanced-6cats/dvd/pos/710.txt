The Cutting Edge is one of those break out feel good movies you can watch anytime and it's still as much fun today as the first time I saw it in 1992.
 
"Doug Dorsey" played with verve by D.B. Sweeney, is a rising hockey star with a bright future ahead him until a freak accident on the ice shatters his chances of playing at the peak of the competitive level. It's not long before Doug is noticed by skating coach "Anton Pamchenko" Roy Dotrice, an affable personality whom the audience gravitates to from the start. Pamchenko brings Mr.Dorsey to the estate of Kate Moseley, Moira Kelly, a would-have been gold medalist at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo. She blamed her former partner for their loss and never fully recovered, you see. Kate has an acerbic tongue that's as sharp as her blades. She has issues welcoming a new partner and Doug is no exeception. The two meet and a hostile alliance is soon formed as they begin practice sessions. Doug isn't used to figure skates and Kate takes full advantage of this by "missing" serveral connections in the routines which cause him to painfully contact the ice. Each time he falls, Kate skates by teasing him uttering "Toe pick." One of my favorite scenes in the movie. Doug is made of quite stern stuff and  soon turns the tables on Kate in a harmless way during an impromtu "hockey game" played on her private indoor rink. 

Having ironed out the roughness, the two become quite polished and a budding romance ensues between them. The question is, do they have what it takes to become 1988 Olympic Champions in pairs figure skating?

The acting is charming and the soundtrack first rate.I would have given it five stars except for the ending, which I won't give away here.
Buy the DVD & CD, you won't be dissappointed
