This is one of the great biopic films ever made.  More often than not, film biopics are too rushed.  They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).  Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great supporting roles as well.  This is a fabulous film, and it feels short at 2 1/2 hours.
