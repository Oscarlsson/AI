Hard to believe it took me until now (February 2007) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made Scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80's. I loved this movie. 

It really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting, especially Tony Montana. A movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is (over 2 hours). Everyone must see Scarface at least once in their lifetime. It won't disappoint. The ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense. Watch it now
