Why on earth am I giving this movie five stars?  Its plot is minimal.  The script has words and phrases I've never heard, and I'm not sure were ever really used in the real world.  And to top that off, it's more than a little unbelievable.

However, despite all of the possible downsides, I really enjoyed it.  Honestly, I'm normally not into these kinds of films, but it was just good fun.  The humor wasn't disgusting and gross.  The chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships believable (even if I don't ever buy the whole love at first sight scenario), and there wasn't some great moral constantly being shoved down my throat.

All in all, it was just a fun movie to watch, and it's been a long time since a movie simply put a smile on my face
