This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales.

But *I* don't want to be nice.  I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to Malmsteen.

He knows alternate picking, I'll give him that.  But then, so do I - and a million others.  He shouldn't be up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most (not all) people .  And yet he is.

He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than about a second.  And this is an *average* figure.

Enough about Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review - Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry Night'.

Vai, though, steals the show.  This coming from a guy who prefers Satriani.  But I can't help it - he is really that good.  And better.  'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you're taught at guitar school.  It is also the best song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'. 

'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really really good.

Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably skip the parts with Yngwie in it
