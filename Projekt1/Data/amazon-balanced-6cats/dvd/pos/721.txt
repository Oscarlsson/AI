All the Danger man DVDs are excellent. The shows are extremely thought provoking and are much more enjoyable if viewed, giving time for some entertaining analysis that almost always occurs when I put these on. Any fan of Mcgoohan, British TV or TV with some intellectual bite to it will enjoy this series
