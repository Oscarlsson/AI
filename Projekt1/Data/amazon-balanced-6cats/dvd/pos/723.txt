I was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by Cat Stevens (his name then).  I was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection.  I was, and still am, a fan of his music.  Nice to see a dvd concert of his.  It is old music, but if you're a fan of the man, you'll enjoy it
