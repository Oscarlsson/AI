The devil's backbone is a horror movie like you've never seen before - a good and intelligent one.. It really is not a horror movie, however, but a story which involves ghosts (or the past) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions.. It is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you.. worth seeing..
