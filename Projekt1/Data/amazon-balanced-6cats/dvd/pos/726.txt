I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this movie. I certainly liked it better than "Red Planet". I believe "Mission to Mars" to be the better of the two movies. It has a stellar cast and, I thought, good on screen chemistry between the actors. Most of the special effects were excellent. All in all, it is a good directorial effort by Brian De Palma.

Somehow, however, this has become the movie that viewers love to hate. Well, I am afraid that I disagree, as I found it to be a pretty decent sci-fi move. Of course, I am partial to this genre of film, so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie. 

The premise of this movie is simple. A crew is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil. A new crew of four go on a rescue mission. These four, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen, Gary Sinise, and Jerry O'Connell, make up the rescue crew. Due to problems encountered in space, only three of the four make it to Mars.

When they get to Mars, they find the surviving crew member. Debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission, they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is, in fact, a giant metallic head made in the image of man. Therein lies the mystery. What they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before. The ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies, "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." So, I ask you, how bad can this movie be? On the contrary, it is actually pretty good. Better yet, it can be watched by the entire family
