This is the 6th and last entry in the series Lone Wolf & Cub.  This one not only has a different director than Kenji, who directed 4 of the others, this is the entry most like a comic-book (the series is based on a famous comic book series).
Not that that is bad.

The whole series fluctuated between great period detail, serious themes, and not taking itself too seriously.  It was at once graphic and fantastic, realistic and wildly improbable,  factual and imaginary. serious & silly.  That's what made it so damn interesting.  

Throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of Japan.  Tracing actual historical roads and cities.  Now we end the series in the mountains and the snow, the White Heaven in Hell of the title.

This entry has a lot of stuff going on:  Lord Retsudo of the hated Yagyu Clan, Ogami's arch enemy, sends his last child, a daughter to do in Ogami with her "Falling Dagger" technique. When, predictably, she fails, he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe.  

The downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in Her Majesties Secret Service, but it ain't bad.  That Ogami's Baby Cart guns never seem to need reloading etc. are minor quibbles.  If Ogami doesn't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them, behead them, or run em through.  Red sprays all over the white snow.

Anyway, they wind the series up with a bang.  One of the strangest, most unique, and unusual series ever produced anywhere.  Worth it if you don't mind the violence
