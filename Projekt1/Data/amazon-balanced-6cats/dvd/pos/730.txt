When this show was on back in the day on Fox I couldnt believe I was actually watching something I could relate to. There doesnt seem to be really that many Tv shows that deal with dark and The Real Life experinces of Real People. If ya ask me when it was on. It was actually something that gave me some relief. I deal everyday with some experinces re-lated to the show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when Titus was on they kept moveing it around. It wasnt fair for the show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did. I hope Chris shows up in something else soon. Hes got one of those faces ya never forget
