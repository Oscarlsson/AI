This is a well-written, thoughtful film. Charlie Hunnam (Pete) really stands out to me - he's perfectly cast, compelling to watch, and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his "mates." It was especially interesting to watch his relationship with Elijah Wood's character evolve. The whole concept of an American being immersed in the British football scene is a unique one and I think it was pulled off really well. The lessons that Elijah Wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must-see
