In this cynical day and age, it's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant (not to mention amazing), but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage?

This film works as a eulogy to Arthur "Killer" Kane, a synopsis of the Dolls' early years, and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea.  It's all things to all people, but it's never boring or condescending.  

I would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema, whether they had any knowledge of the Dolls or not, simply because it's a great story, well told, and stands up to repeated viewings.
