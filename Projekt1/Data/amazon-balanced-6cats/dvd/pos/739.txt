This is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of America.  In fact, the real star of the show, asie from the ubiquitous red Ford Taurus, is the scenery of America itself.  The camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics.  Unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene, but the point of the series is to give a "Reader's Digest" view of places people can visit.

But excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series. Each "trip" is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral "family vacations" combined into a one hour program. This is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm
