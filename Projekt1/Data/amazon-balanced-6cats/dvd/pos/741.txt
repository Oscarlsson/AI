I found the film, "Malice" to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery. Sure, there are a lot of twist's in the film, however, that is what I found to be very good about this film. Especially the way these twist's were done. There will be no spoilers in this review. The film begin's with murders occuring in a small college town. Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings. All circumstantial. Moreover, he is having problems with his wife (Nicole Kidman). Something happens to her, and she blames Andy for this. [To tell you would give away the film]

It seems as if one of Andy's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon (Alec Baldwin). Therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief, and the Doctor (Balwin) in particular who caused this grief to her. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. There are several stories going on at once. First, you have a serial killer, secondly you have a distraught wife (Kidman) blaming her ex-husband and his Doctor friend for what has happened to her. But there is more to her than the viewer suspect's. I will leave this to you to discover. The film is better than the reviews warrant. It is a very suspenseful film full of twists. Recommended!
