This is an amazing DVD. I read reviews online all the time saying "anyone will like this", but seriously. I even showed it to my mother who laughed. That's a big deal.
This DVD follows these four comedians on their two week tour. Their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city.
Also throughout the episodes, it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in America during her "time of need", interpersonal relationships, and anything else they could think of.
This DVD makes me laugh to tears every time. Literally
