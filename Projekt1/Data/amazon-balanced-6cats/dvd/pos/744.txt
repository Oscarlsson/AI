I have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the Mask is no exception. I would also have to say that the Mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films. There are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but I think the one thing that shines the most about the Mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it. For those of you who don't know, a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old Tex Avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress (this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd). These kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes. Getting back on the subject, what I also found thrilling about the Mask is how well the dog Milo was trained to perform certain task. If you have seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about. The training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd. The movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the Mask. Though not quite as dark as the comics, the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the Mask would not be deemed as a children's film hence the PG-13 rating. A big plus to the Mask was how Jim Carrey portrayed the different character traits of Stanley Ipkis and Stanley Ipkis wearing the mask. Another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask. And of course, who can dislike Ben Stein's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks? Oh, and Cameron Diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well. As for the dvd, this re-release is an improvement from the previous. You get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture. The added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie
