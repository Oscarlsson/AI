good actors, great story... some good action too... this is great movie to help put together the bits and pieces of the stories you've heard about Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, and more.  It all may be true history, it may be fictional, it may just be myths mixed with fact, but whatever the case, there's more truth than not in this version of the 1870'
