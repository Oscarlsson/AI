I first saw this movie when I was a kid.  It left a good impression.  I am now nearly 50 and a cat came to live with me.  My first female cat.  I named it Mewsette in honor of Judy Garland's character in the movie.  I then searched for the movie on the internet, found it, bought it.  While it's not as good as it was when I was a kid, it is still amusing
