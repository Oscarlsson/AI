Let's face it, Tinseltown has run out of original story lines. That's usually when they turn to remakes. I've seen several remakes over the years, both TV and movie, but this is one of the best remakes I've seen in quite some time. I really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line. What a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the TV show and pulled all of it's story from the comic book. If you were never into comics to begin with then you can't appreciate the story line. 

Another thing that I feel is under appreciated about this movie is the CGI. People have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time! The amount of man hours that went in to creating the CGI is something to be applauded and appreciated, not mocked and thrown out with the trash. You have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value. 

Most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it.

The story of the Hulk is a sad, depressing, dramatic story! There isn't anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something.

The Hulk wasn't meant to be campy, it was meant to be serious. 

My only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play Banner's love interest. The little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted
