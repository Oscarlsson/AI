I bought The Homecoming 3-4yrs ago, and I watch it every year at Christmas.  I found it on the floor in my house after Hurricane Katrina, still in the package it came in.  I brought the DVD to my new place of residence and popped it in the player and it has been playing since I found it.  When ever I'm down it watch it, so I can relieve some of my own childhood memories of the season.  It is a must see for the young and old
