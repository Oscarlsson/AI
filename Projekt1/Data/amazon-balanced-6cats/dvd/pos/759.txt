This movie is very simple, and unique. It's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art, and be touched at the same time
