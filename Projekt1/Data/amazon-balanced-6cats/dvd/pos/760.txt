Eddie and Rose are meant to be in Nicole Savoca's "Dogfight."

This is a warm and wonderful movie; those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can. 
 
It's sad that so few people have heard of or seen Dogfight. How a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me.
 
Many others have synopsized the story, so I wont be repetitive. I will say that this movie's genius is in its acting. River Phoenix and Lili Taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends, and it shows in scene after scene. River gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse, absurdly young "jarhead," Eddie, about to ship out to Vietnam. His coming of age is the narrative behind this movie, while Rose's idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the "dogfight" make her character angelic. The poignancy of the closing scene, in which Eddie embraces Rose, in tears,  after having lost his three best friends during the Vietnam war will stay with you for a long time. 
 
Dogfight is a unique and touching film. It harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as "romantic" by Hollywood today.
