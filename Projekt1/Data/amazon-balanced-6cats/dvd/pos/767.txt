it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes
it gets shocks
like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes
it gets more interesting as the plot unravels
great actors picked for such roles
the perfect killing machines
one insane in the brain
and one out to save lives that shouldn't be lost in the first place
the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and the soldier says "I just want to eat, I don't wanna hurt you, then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal. and his reporter female friend comes in and says "good meal" as a question that is. and he says without words "makes a happy sigh" that's hilarious. and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food
priceless movie
worth the watch again and again
I'm glad I saw this on tv when I was younger
and I'm glad I got this on dv
