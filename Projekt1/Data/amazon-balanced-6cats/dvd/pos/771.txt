"Venom " is one of those movies I thought I would hate because I heard so much negativity about it but I really enjoyed it ,being a fan of the 70's and 80's slashers I crave newer versions because I have seen all the other ones over and over again.
Venom did NOT disappoint me.
It starts off with action and never lets up.I found it to be one of my favorite new horror/slasher flicks,The voodoo angle was good but not overplayed ,I'm simple in  that I want to see a killer with an axe , machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo..I don't want to have to wonder" was that a dream or was it real~!!" As so many movies these days play off of.
Give me an old fashioned slice and dice and I'm in heaven.and Venom gave me that , So I hope to see Venom 2 ,if so ,I'm there

(For the record, Mr Jangles used the hook & Chain before Kane in see No Evil...)
