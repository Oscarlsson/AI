This DVD version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable.  Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in particular!  ;)

I don't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format.  It didn't bother me at all.  Disappointment I could understand, but this kind of vitriol?  It's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages, and I found it a refreshing change from the dumbed-down "kid's" movies they tend to make these days.  Adults will enjoy the suspenseful story, retro style, and feline antics just as much as kids will.  I'd skip the remake and get the original
