War exposed some violence simmering within one Gulf War veteran.  Christian Bale is electrifying as Jim, a tough-minded ex-Ranger whose brutal nature didn't subside after his return home to LA.
They say war changes a man.  This might be evident here, but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of Jim.  Along with his buddy Mike(Freddy Rodriguez), the two tear through the town, bingeing on drugs and alcohol. 
Their is no deep plot here, just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs.  But it is a great character study, watching Jim self-destruct.  Bale is great in this type of role, like he was in American Psycho or The Machinist.  I liked this movie much more than Training Day, which this director previously wrote the screenplay for
