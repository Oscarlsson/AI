Clarification:  After reviewing the set and then receiving the set...I Must applaud A&amp;E for the brilliant 20 minute BEHIND-THE-SCENES special on the 5th disc!  Finally...the puppeteers get to talk about their work and you actually get to see inside the puppet's heads!  Also on DISC 5, they did include the lost footage from the 40th Episode!  BRAVO
