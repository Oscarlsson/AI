This is a film like none other you have ever seen, and as such you'll either love it, or hate it.

From the "reviews" posted on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it.

This film is not literal.  Learn to *think* about what you are watching.  To interpret archetypes, symbolism and metaphor.

A clue: the Lady character is named STORY.  Now why might that be?

And why would she require a VESSEL before taking flight into the world?

And what precisely does the wolf-like Scrunt represent?

And why are there THREE of those monkeys?

This film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world.  If you aren't an artist, you probably won't get it at all, and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this.  

But that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says, and love every beautiful, unique and visionary second of it.

Magical.
