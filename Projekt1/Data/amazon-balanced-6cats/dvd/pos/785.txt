Like her legendary mother, nobody around today takes command of the stage like Liza Minnelli and this legendary event at New York's Radio City Music Hall clearly illustrates this...always a five star event in concert, I have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from 1970 to 2005 and I am here to say that she has still got it and always will!!! In recent years for some silly reason that I don't get, the media has tried to damage Liza's artistic credibility but it doesn't work when Liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary Superstar...numerous standing ovations later it is clear that Liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper...BRAVO Liza and keep on rocking!!
