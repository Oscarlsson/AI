A wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it.  It is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity.  

As a big fan of Greer Garson, I must comment on Jane Bedinger's review in which she claimed that Ms. Garson was having an "affair" with the actor who played her son.  Ms. Garson fell in love with and married Richard Ney about a year after the movie was made.  I don't see how Ms. Bedinger could consider this an "affair".
