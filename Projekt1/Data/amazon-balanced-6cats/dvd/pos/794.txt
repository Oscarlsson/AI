After starting my 9/11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown "WHAT!" after "Loose Change - 2nd Ed" last year, I've watched and or read just about them all.  9/11: Press for Truth comes out on top, in my humble opinion, as the best 9/11 timeline presentation out there.  Nothing included that isn't in the mainstream press - just on the back page, and spread out over five years.  The film makes few of the outright accusations that "Loose Change 2nd - Ed" does towards any of the events or people involved in 9/11, but delivers more of damning argument that we've been lied to - there weren't just mistakes made, but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government.  I hope that we, the people, finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out.  And the bad guys pay. Good movie
