I bought this for my 3yr old twins, and from the first showing, I kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons. My girls already are familiar with some fairy tales, so they really loved "The Three Little Pigs" and "The Pied Piper". I highly recommend this DVD and think it is a great buy for parents with young children
