Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times
