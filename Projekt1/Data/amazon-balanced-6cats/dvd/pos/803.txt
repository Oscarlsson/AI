The Dead Zone is still one of the best shows on tv, and while I agree with some of the other posts, the Stillson story arc was handled, well, strangely.

As for the DVD's the box reads "Closed Captioned" as a feature. Sadly they are not. Hopefully USA knows about this, and will remedy the situation
