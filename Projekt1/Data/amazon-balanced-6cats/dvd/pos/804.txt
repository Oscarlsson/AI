This movie was probably the best one next to Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and Jirachi Wish Maker. Pokemon Ranger centers around the legendary Pokemon Manaphy and of course Ash and his friends. Some new and amazing characters include Buizel, Jackie the Ranger, Mantyke, and Chatot the annoying but funny Pokemon. The villian is great, the ending is amazing, and the effects were the best yet
