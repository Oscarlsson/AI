This video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners.  I started taking a Vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so I looked for a video to supplement my practice at home.  What a great choice.  Baron Baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home.  I highly recommend this DVD
