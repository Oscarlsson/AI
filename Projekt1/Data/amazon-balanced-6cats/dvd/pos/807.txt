OK, this definately looks very promising.  I saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago.  It was good.  If that is any indication on how good the show is then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should be better.  I am going to purchase this soon.  Once I purchase it, I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes .

A month ago is when I really learned of this series so I am truly looking forward to watching this series.
