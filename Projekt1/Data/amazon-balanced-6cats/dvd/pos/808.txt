This is a great DVD.  I bought it for my son, who has Special Needs.  He attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to do the Electric Slide or Macarena.  Neither my husband nor I knew how to do these dances either.  I played the "Party Line Dances" DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions.  Pretty soon he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well.  And by joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly picked up the dance moves too.  My son now participates fully, and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions
