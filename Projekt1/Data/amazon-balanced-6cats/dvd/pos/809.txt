Hey...this is a great DVD with great packaging--definitely one of the best that I've seen, and there is a lot of extras. Definitely a must-have for He-Man and She-Ra fans! I just got an e-mail stating that the distributor of He-Man will be releasing She-Ra on DVD, starting July 11. That release will be "The Secret of the Sword" and five other episodes deemed most popular by fans. After that, in the fall they will release the complete 93 episodes in three separate volumes within the next 12 months. For anyone who wants to see for themselves, go to tvshowsondvd.com and look at the news for She-Ra. I hope you are as excited as I am
