I rented this (sigh) several years ago, liked it or Julia Roberts enough to buy it but didn't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today.  I regretted buying a new copy after all, remembering it only as a few heartwarming (I didn't want my heart warmed) months in the lives of just plain folks in CT.  (Incidentally, the 3 girls are not sisters, just 2 of them.)  I made fun of it, my friend made fun of it, I watched a few minutes then turned it off, then watched some more, finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it.  It has charm.  It IS a soap opera, but I thought it was well acted and well done.  It had humor, happiness, sadness, embarrassment (like the barrels of fish in the rich kid's car), love.  It had so much plot that it practically had none at all.  And I liked it.  But now, 15 minutes later, I'm beginning all over again to wonder why I bought it.  I could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick.  That man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all, no range, no depth, somehow he could carry a tune, but that's about the size of it, speaking of size, the size of his ego (which I assume is why he didn't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics) would have made a mushroom cloud!  I recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing.  For it's kind, I thought it was perfectly done.  I just like them a smidge more sophisticated.  The vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious.
