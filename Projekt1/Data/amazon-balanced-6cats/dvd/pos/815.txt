I previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars. But after watching it again, I realized I liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof, on their faces while they are dancing. They either look completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it. 

I also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace ("Opaque"). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all. The music is saying "fast, big, upbeat" and she's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves.

And of course, we all love the S&M piece...excuse me, S&M is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to see what WAS on her part.

Another thing I would have liked to see is more GOTH music. I like Solace and all, but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the Goth genre. There were a few, but not enough for my liking.

My favorites on this video were Tempest, Ariellah, Jeniviva and Ayshe (for wierdness factor). For all of its faults, this is a good video to be inspired by and I will use it for that purpose
