They do't make musicals like this anymore. Well,they don't really make musicals anymore, do they? They used to make them, made them well and they came out like "Down Argentine Way." The plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright,costumes lavish and not a few laughts. The major players- Betty Grable and Don Ameche- are as engaging as usual.Carmen Miranda makes her US film debut and sings, dances and mispronounces her way to stardom. The 20th Century Fox role players appear (Charlotte Greenwood, J. Carrol Naish, Henry Stephenson)and add to the fun.
