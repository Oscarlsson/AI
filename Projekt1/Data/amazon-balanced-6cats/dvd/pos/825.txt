I will make this short.  Aykroyd, Candy two men who are hilarious together is of course hilarious.  The story is about a man who loves his family and is a middle class man going on vaction.  His relatives decide to join him without letting him know.  The relatives are totally diffren't from the family they join and seeing them mingle is a riot.  I say get this movie because everyone I know who has seen it all say the same thing  "I love that movie, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
