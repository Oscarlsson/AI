DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic - a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk - King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel "Alone." 

Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility. 

To say that King David is the best part he's ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before.

I would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist
