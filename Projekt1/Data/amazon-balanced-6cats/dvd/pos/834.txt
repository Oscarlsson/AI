I just watched "Mommie Dearest" for the first time tonight. As most critics and fans of "Mommie Dearest" acknowledge, the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse, with such an over-dramatic (but entirely true-to-life) performance by Faye Dunaway, it was both hilarious and depressing.  I'm 30 and didn't know much about Joan Crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being "classic camp."  Seems to me Crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder.  I think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to. She knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do, whether it was having a successful marriage, a happy family, or even giving to charity. Her life was a running commercial directed by Hollywood, not unlike the tabloid-driven, image-obsessed Hollywood we have today. Despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling's victimization on film, Christina's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life. Christina Crawford was completely justified turning her mother's image on its head with her book and movie. Yes, the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering. After all, what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh. Mocking the unexplained, unjustified pain you experienced in the past, renders it powerless to harm your future. This is the legacy of "Mommie Dearest" whatever Joan Crawford really was
