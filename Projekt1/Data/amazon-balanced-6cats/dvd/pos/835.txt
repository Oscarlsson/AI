I don't own a copy of the original cut, and it's been a while since I've seen the original cut.

A short review of THIS version is as follows. 

The film print is FLAWLESS in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70's or 80's on purpose. The blue filter is gone, so it doesn't look slick and shiny. This film is dark, rich, and grungy. Very "noir-ish", and warm.

Obviously the running gag through out the first film was that Porter wants his 70k back... not 130k or 1 million, just 70k. This was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it. The first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again.

Porter in this film is not charming or smooth. He's smart, violent, and cold. A true anti-hero. The annoying voice over narration is gone. There are several new characters, and several new brutal kills. 

Minus the credits, this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes. 

This is a great companion piece to the great "To Live and Die in L.A." It got the same mood.


I told you this review was going to be short.
