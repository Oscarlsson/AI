Based on a true story and a book called EVIDENCE OF LOVE, this tv movie is made remarkable by the Emmy-winning performance of Barbara Hershey.  She is utterly magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally murders her ex-lover's wife in a self defensive rage.  Hershey superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman who commits a heinous deed.  Her hypnosis sequence is brutally painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage.
Brian Dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her out of her terrifying predicament.
The movie is impressively done and once again worthy most of all for Ms. Hershey's dynamic presence
