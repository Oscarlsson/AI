This disc is pure gold! Featuring a FULL live performance from their 2004 European tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate Stray Cats fan collectible! The concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80's. They show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show. They go through all their classics and then some. Whether it's "Stray Cat Strut" "Gene And Eddie" or "Rumble In Brighton" what you see and hear on this disc is flawless. Must buy for ALL music fans, not just fans of the Cats
