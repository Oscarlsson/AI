This is an excellent film. A lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at HBCU's!!!! As a matter of fact, the issue of lightskinned vs. darkskinned is still going on today, on a college campus or not. Spike Lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time. He is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the African American community. I highly recommend this film. If you haven't seen it, get the DVD. It's a classic
