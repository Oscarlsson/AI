I have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv. I had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and I have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out. The gradual awakening of young Ta to which girl is truly right for him and Sammy Fong's attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out  during late night broadcasts. The ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from James Shigeta to a professional dancer. Afterall, it's the music and the story that make this great.
