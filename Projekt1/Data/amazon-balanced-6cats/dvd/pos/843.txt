I thought this movie was great!  It's definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie-goer.  It's probably the best dark comedy I've ever seen (only to rival the masterpiece that is &quot;Heathers&quot;).  The dialog in this movie with leave you with one-liners for years to come.  After seeing &quot;Party Girl&quot; I fell in love with Parker Posey, and when I saw this I loved her even more. This instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time, but then again I'm a huge fan of good dark comedies and I have a sick sense of humor. Everyone I know absolutely loved this move (including my MOM!) In any event, this is a definite must-see for any fan of Parker Posey and dark comedy.  Excellent
