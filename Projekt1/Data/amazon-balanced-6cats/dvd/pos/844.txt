Of course Dead Alive was the better movie.  But I think the comparisons to the Peter Jackson masterpiece are appropriate, due to the fact that there is a high body count, lots of over-the-top splattery deaths, and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers, some as zombie lunch.  Apparently there was some footage  cut out for this release.  I'm not sure if that was gore footage or not, but I would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence.  There is even some non-gore &quot;grossout&quot; humor (vomit-related, etc.) that reminded me of Bad Taste as well as Dead Alive.  Sorry to run the Peter Jackson comparison into the ground, but again the influence is unquestionable.  Don't expect the FX quality of Dead Alive though, this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly.  I don't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print/transfer, but it's a minor distraction.  They did a great job with a relatively small budget.  I echo the other reviewers who would like to see Ittenbach's other films on US (hopefully uncut) DVD release--I've heard Burning Moon is especially crazy
