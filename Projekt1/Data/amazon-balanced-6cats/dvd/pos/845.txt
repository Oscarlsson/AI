SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture.  Not that that is a bad thing: the script by John Guare is brilliant.  It simply seems a little static, with its marvelous plays on words, repeated phrases, and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow.

Essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland - both in peak form) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young African American con artist (Will Smith) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence.  Most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as Kitty Carlisle, Ian McKellen, artists Chuck Close and Kazuko, Mary Beth Hurt, Bruce Davidson etc - a really fine ensemble.  There are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made.  This was one of Will Smith's entries into film as well as one of the gifted Stockard Channing's finest roles.  Highly recommended for repeated viewings. Grady Harp, October 0
