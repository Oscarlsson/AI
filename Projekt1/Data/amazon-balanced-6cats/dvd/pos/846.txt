I remember way back in '80 when this movie was the buzz of Hollywood. That is, the buzz on Johnny Carson.  The media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself.

Yet, in the mid 80's, it came out on both Betamax and VHS, and naturally I bought me a Beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was.

First, it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption.  It is long and intraclly woven together.  it is lavish and sometimes loud.  It is a brutal slap in the face to "Manifest Destiny" and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is "God's" country.  As if their 'God" gave them wealth and privilige and that this God justifies revolution, massacre and war.

Many comparisons can be mase with the America of the late 19th century and the America ruled presently by King George W. and his robber barons of Capitalism.  But it is now, as then, much more conveniant to steer the "common man" into their churches, into their army,  into their lies.  The enemy is those "illegal aliens" those in the "gay agenda," those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo.  Kris Kristofferson plays a mayor/sherriff if wealth and means who (shock-shock) sides with the common man and the undertrodden.  When another of his "breeding and class" challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class, he replies to the creep:  "You are not of my class, to be of my class you first have to die and be born again!"

This is a revolutionary movie, meant to be savored, each and every minute of it.  This movie dares you to look at  things usually not into history books or shown on the History Channel
