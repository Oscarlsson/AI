if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...
