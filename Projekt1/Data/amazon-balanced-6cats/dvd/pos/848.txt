I'm very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble.  Story line shmory line, this is an ACTION movie.  I watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion.  Kind of a heartbreaking movie, though, because he's dead no matter what.  The man can't sleep or he slips in a coma.  Going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her... that's a film.  You won't regret owning this, I promise you.

p.s.  It is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies.  That is all
