In this movie based on a true story we see Jerry Stahl played by Ben Stiller. Jerry is a geek Hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is Shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing. Jerry has it all- a Hollywood mansion, Liz Hurley, a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some Heroin. Jerry's Heroin habit costs $6,000 a week but he is only earning $5000(!!!) per week. One does not need a Phd. in Advanced Mathematics to realize this this spells TROUBLE. Jerry eventually gets clean with the help of Maria Bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book. One can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the Drug Scene. I give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has Maria Bello in it although I still can't figure out why she finds Jerry The Geek so interesting. His story is the same as any Street Junkie.They all look the same to me when they are injecting Heroin into their veins on the street
