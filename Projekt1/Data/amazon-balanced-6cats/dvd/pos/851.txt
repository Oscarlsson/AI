This is the third DVD from Shawn Trautman that I have gotten (Swing and Cha-Cha are the others), and they are all exceedingly well done.  They start from ground zero and progress in very small steps that are a snap to follow.  By the time it's over, you will understand the logic behind the dance and know enough to do well on a social dance floor.  It will also get you pumped to learned more advanced steps; you won't feel intimidated.  I highly recommend it
