Burt Lancaster stars in this tough, grim noir-drenched prison flick, in which a sadistic prison guard (a young Hume Cronyn) manipulates tensions and weaknesses to produce an explosive situation.  The film's liberal message butts up against its obligatory &quot;crime never pays&quot; ending; the convicts are sympathetic, but doomed from the word &quot;go.&quot;  A little stagey and lurid, but overall tense and suspenseful -- the ending is a real nail-biter.
