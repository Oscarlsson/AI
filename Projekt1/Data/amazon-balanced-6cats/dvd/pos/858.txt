I had heard about this flick being talked about as the Chinese Charlie's Angels.  It took me a while but I finally popped it in.  WOW, this has to be on of the coolest movies  I have seen in a while.  I was expecting a chick flick but maybe that is why I liked it so much.  

The story is about these 2 women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do now is assasinate people for a living.  Sweet!  I am not going to lie, I wasn't paying attention to the story what so ever the first time i saw this because of how hot these women are.  Add in a super hot cop who wants to take them down, and you have yourself one of the funnest movie ever.  All of these girls know martial arts, or at least they can put their legs up really high and director Corey Yuen puts in some of the best wirework I have seen.  This movie certainly isn't going to win any awards for it's high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that I wish I could fill my room with about 100 diffrerent screen shot posters.  

So on top of this being an amazingly fun movie, Yasuaki Kurata shows up for the finale!!!!!!!  Corey Yuen goes all out with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie.  If you have seen some of Coery's 80's stuff like Yes Madam or even the newer Fong Sai Yuk then get ready to be taken back some years when Corey did some of the best action sequences in the history of cinema(Example:Ninja in the Dragon's Den).  Kurata plays a great character in my favorite movie ever, Legend of a Fighter which was made in 1981.  Well at 56 years old he looks just as good!!!!  I was so amazed by this movie I have watched it 3 nights in a row and I will continue this routine for a while:)

The picture quality on the Columbia Tristar version is perfect and has pretty well written subtitles.  Also good 5.1 sound, cantonese track, the original mandarin track, and a horrible English dub.
