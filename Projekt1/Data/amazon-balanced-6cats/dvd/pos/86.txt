It is the declining days of the Great War (WWI), the Germans are leaving a small French town but are leaving a little present for the advancing British troops.  They have buried the munitions in the town square.  When the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded.  The town's people evacuate.  During this the barber sends off a message to the British.

The British decide to send a man to check this out.  They choose the bumbling Scottish Private Plumpick (Alan Bates).  Located on the outskirts of town is an asylum.  The sisters who run the asylum escape with the town's people, leaving the inmates to fend for themselves.  They return to the town, resuming their lives before being commited.

Plumpick arrives in town but doesn't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum.  He meets the beautiful Coquelicat (Genevieve Bujold) and falls in love with her.  He finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb (of course it's more complex and hilarious than just that.)  He also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town's people.  The funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people.  So shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves.

This is half fairy tale and half fable.  Alan Bates gives a great performance and Genevieve Bujold shows great whimsy.
