I remember putting Season 9 as the worst season of Friends in my book, but it's not as bad as I remembered. Some episodes are actually incredibly funny. The faux pas was when they started to have Aisha Tyler guess star as Charlie, and have her come between Joey and Ross. Also, the whole story line with Rachel's infatuation for Joey could've been better executed, or shouldn't have been there at all. It got bad towards the end, but I'm not disappointed. The stuff leadings towards it was classic Friends
