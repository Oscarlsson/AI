This series is exactly what the English love about mystery and crime.  It's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like "The Shield".  That being said, this series is well done and does capture you over time.  Rather than individual crime stories, this series contains only one crime investigation.  If you like drama and cop stories, this is a good one
