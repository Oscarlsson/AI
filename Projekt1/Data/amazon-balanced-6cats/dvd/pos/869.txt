I think "Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown" was fine. The only sad things were when Charlie Brown didn't get any valentines until a day later, and when Linus missed giving valentine treats to his teacher. I would have felt the same way as Violet when Charlie Brown wasn't getting valentines. I would say Charlie Brown should have gotten as many valentines as the others. Everybody is too mean to him!

"A Charlie Brown Valentine" was swell because it wasn't as sad. On this one, Charlie Brown seems to go after the little red haired girl through most of it. He wanted to dance with her, but couldn't. What sounded odd to me was that Peppermint Patty sent him a valentine this time. It would only sound like her if she really loved Charlie Brown
