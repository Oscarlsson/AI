As I went through music school in the eary fifties I was confronted with "Lenny". Now at 72 I still have this pleasure. There are people in the NYP that are legendary as are the performances. This set will give me a huge amount of pleasure for what ever time I have left. It is a wonderful historical document but most of all a tribute-legacy that people will be wondering about many years in the future. Bob Allshouse from the Dana school of Music 1952-57
