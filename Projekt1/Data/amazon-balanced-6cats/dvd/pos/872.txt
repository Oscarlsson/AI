These are excellent performances for a very reasonable price.  The look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is "dated" but the performances easily shine through.  Not quite as well played, recorded or filmed as Bernstein's many later Unitel films but still well worth the investment.   I won't spend time on details but rest assured it's all great stuff!
