This was the first DVD I purchased after I bought my DVD player (I know, it took me a while to get one). I had never seen the movie before, but amazon[.com] reccomended it so I took the chance. It had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance. It's the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old. Boy and girl are best friends. Girl likes boy, but boy likes a different girl. Boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl. Boy realizes he's in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving
