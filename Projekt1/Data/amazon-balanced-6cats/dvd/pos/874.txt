WOW! This was a pretty decent romantic comedy. We had this in our collection for months (Possibly years) and never watched it. We decided to watch this film on a whim. I have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it would be.

Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well.

I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention. 

The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late.

Cute movie, with a good heart. Definetly made a date night at home wonderful.
