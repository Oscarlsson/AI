5 stars to the film itself! Here's a painful study of a woman's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate, uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of  industrial waste. The character study is not unlike claustrophobic  Polanski's Repulsion but dwells on Vitti's being consumed by her external  surroundings as opposed to Deneuve's intensive plunge to schizophrenia. The  pace and landscape is virtual Antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who  are not familiar with the director's works. One of his greatest works  (L'Avventura remains his best to me). The only problem is the DVD transfer.  I've seen the VHS and it has a consistent hue of orange. The DVD, although  sharper and clearer, fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds  and oranges in long shots. For a film that essentially deals with color (it  was Antonioni's first color feature), the transfer was rather clumsy and  careless. The sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement.  Why didn't Criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film
