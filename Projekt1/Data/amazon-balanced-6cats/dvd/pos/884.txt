I'm not sure if the drills in this video are really championship calibre.  However, most of the drills that I used with my team were effective.  This video is for the first or second year Junior High coach (like myself) or any coach on the recreational level (ie. CYO and/or PAL coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter).  They are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough. The narrator uses the expression "dual purpose" drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill.  Combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills.  For instance, a drill with 3 players, one shooter, one rebounder and one passer.  A simple drill but after the shooter shoots, he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot.  The timing is such that when he gets back to his spot, the passer is already passing the ball.  Thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when I tried it, it worked great!  Other drills also worked well like "shots across the lane" and a few of the rebounding drills.  The explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the X's and 0's.  Added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video.  The drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long.  The sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach.  The video could have been more detailed with more theory (which I like), but in truth, it gives you just what it says.  Some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy
