Like Stuart Gordon's other venture into science fiction territory, the underrated and ill-fated ROBOT JOX, this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor, which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience. Everyone joins in the fun in this one, with Dennis Hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog, Debi Mazar and Stephen Dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and Charles Dance having the time of his life with his horny half-metal madman. This Excellent DVD offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the Director.
