The movie is a brillant mix of drama, love, and comedy. The casting was brillant with greats like Judd and Bullock.

In the movie we are introduced to Siddalee Walker a women who has made her mother Vivianne mad. Vivianne always seemed heartless and distant to Sidda and when Sidda tells a reporter about her mother some things get twisted out of proportion and printed the wrong way, which makes Vivi mad. Enter the Ya-Ya's three of Vivi's friends. They feel that Sidda should know the truth about her mother and maybe she would understand. So they kidnap Sidda and start to tell her about her mother. We learn that Vivi wasn't well liked by her own mother and was seen as a bad person by her mother. Then we learn that Vivi's first love whom she never got over was killed at war which is why she hates her husband. Sidda then starts to question her current realationship thinking she'll be a bad mother and calls off her wedding. Phase two of the Ya Ya's plan. They must tell Sidda something about her mother that will change everything.

Very good plot that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. This would be a good one to watch with friends or mothers.
