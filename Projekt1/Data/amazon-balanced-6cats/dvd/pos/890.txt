I'll get to the plot of "The Gang's All Here" in a minute, because the
plot isn't the most memorable part of this movie. The most memorable part is the bananas.

About 20 minutes into the movie, a towering hat of Technicolor fruitappears on the screen, followed by its owner--"Brazilian bombshell" Carmen Miranda. She proceeds to do a number called "The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat," accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas. Six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number's end, when the chorus girls, worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit, lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island.

There's a reason this number occurs so early on: It takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie.

But then, this is Busby Berkeley, a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war. And next to kitsch, war is pretty much the motivator here.

The wafer-thin story involves Andy (James Ellison), a soldier who woos and wins Edie (Alice Faye), a canteen dancer, the nightbefore Andy goes off to World War Two. In what seems an instant, Andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of Andy's childhood sweetheart and fiancee--who, unfortunately for Edie, is not Edie.  
Will the heartbreak be resolved? Do you really care? The plot is
mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major '40s
stars (in particular, Eugene Pallette and Edward Everett Horton are
hilarious), and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out
of thin air. (In a couple of scenes, Benny Goodman and his
orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of
it.)

"The Gang's All Here" is really a 1943 time capsule, but an
eye-popping rouser of one. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
They didn't make 'em much like this back then, either
