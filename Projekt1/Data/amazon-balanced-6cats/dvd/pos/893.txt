This DVD has a lot of good info and practical tips for improving starts, turns, and finishes for competitive swimmers. I swim for the Masters (adult) program, and am not tremendously competitive, but have learned so much. I actually swam in a meet and did passably well, thanks to some of the ideas I learned from this video. Well worth it
