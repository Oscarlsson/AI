In a movie such as this, only James Cameron could do it justice. This documentary follows one of the most haunting disasters in the history of sea travel, and for that reason, everything had to be perfect and it was. The special effects are unparalleled, and the intricacy of the technological advances only exemplifies the rest of the good points of the movie. This probably could have gotten the remaining 0.5 points (going by the KAB scale, of course), except I was really hoping that the filmmakers would have explored the stern section of the ship, which, I believe was supposed to be located a half mile away from the bow section.

The KAB score: 9.5
