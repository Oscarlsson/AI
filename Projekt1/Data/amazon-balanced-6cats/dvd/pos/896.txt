I didn't give this five stars because it's some kind of Oscar-worthy achievement, but if you are a fan of the quirky, B-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties, then this film is a must. "Hawk" offers hilarious jump-cut editing, dialogue that is spectacular in its badness, and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film. 

For all that, the film is also remarkable for its innocence, in a time when cheesecake T&A fantasy like "The Sword and the Sorceress" and the infamous "Deathstalker" series were the norm, "Hawk the Slayer" keeps it clean, and is all the funnier for it.

If you have the right sort of friends, then snap this gem up, invite them over for beer and pizza, and have a go. It's more than worth it
