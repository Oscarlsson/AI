this dvd is one of the best i have seen. only britney spears live tops this in picture quality.ricki sings his best songs in front of new york city backdrop. he put alot of energy into this concert.the sound quality is the best and picture quality is also great. a little bit less fuzz on some objects would have been nice! but still its great and colorfull with all the lights on stage
