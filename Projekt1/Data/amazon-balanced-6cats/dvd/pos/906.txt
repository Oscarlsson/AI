In sanskrit, Ayurveda means the study of life. According to ancient Hindu texts, all healing systems stem from Ayurvedic medicine. This Ancient Ayurveda series dvd, led by Sarah Tomlinson with clarity and insight, provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana, symbol and metaphor. Tomlinson, acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths. To effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds, we must change habitual patterns in the body. The poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements, and Tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit. Filmed against a simple, soothing background, Tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles. Instead, the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master Gandharva,directly relates to the series in it's use of each of the planetary mantras. 
Tomlinson's has a great depth of knowledge about ayurveda, and she weaves many subtle suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into the practice. This dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced student: beginners will feel supported and encouraged, as well as exhilirated by the practice, and more experienced students will appreciate the multi-level aspect of Tomlinson's class.
