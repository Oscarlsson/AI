This movie is intimate and special. Some reviews say it is the story of obsession, of fetishism, of trivial things. However, this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy's life: his fantasy woman. 
   The character Malena rarely speaks throughout the movie, but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her- through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young "love". This perspective makes her ideal and special, with few flaws,as a fantasy woman is to a young man. Malena is instantly a likeable character, not awful and disgusting like those using her. 
   We cannot forget that our narrator, Renato, is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story. Therefore, he is unreliable as a narrator. Malena's sins are washed clean through his judgement, and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women. However, Renato has had years to think about everything, to contemplate what really happened to her. So, in the end, the people who use her are completely despicable, unable to garner any liking. 
   Of course, she is a victim, but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men. The movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems: she is from another city and her husband, for most of the movie, is dead. Yet, she chooses to not escape but to stay, and her fate is sealed.
    The music in the movie was nominated for Best Score in 2000,and it is beautiful, emotional. It truly adds to the feeling of the movie. 
    I would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story, emotion, and characters. You will never forget this movie.
