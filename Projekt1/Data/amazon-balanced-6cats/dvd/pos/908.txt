I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd. take advantage of the low price and BUY THIS NOW! i'm no expert on the HOT ROD scene, but this was very enjoyable. The footage of pinstripe artist SKRATCH is worth the price alone.
    I would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this. you get to see the creative process of some great project cars, as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members. I will definitely be watching this one a few times
