This movie is full of memorable scenes, although it's probably been more than a decade since I last saw it.  It's suspenseful without being gory...the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood. And even though I'd read the book and knew the outcome I was on the edge of my seat right to the finish
