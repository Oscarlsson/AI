The sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good.  I bought this primarily to see Jaco.  The biggest distraction was the bits of James Dean and Doo Wap music videos from the 50's added in.  I wish this was remastered with just the concert performances.  Also, it appears to me that the Jaco Bass solo was cut.  I still give it 5 stars regardless.
