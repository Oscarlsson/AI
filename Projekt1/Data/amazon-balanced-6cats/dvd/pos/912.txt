The Truth About Cats and Dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable, refreshing movie. Janeane Garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical, depressed, miserable, pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want. 

Of course, she's not really acting. That's really her: lock, stock, and barrel. The miserable, pessimistic, vicious act isn't an act at all.

The fly in the ointment to this movie is that Uma Thurman is not a knockout. Of course, some men would prefer the tall, thin blonde over the short brunette, but the basis of the movie hinges on Uma being the gorgeous woman and Janeane being average. But it doesn't work when you believe it's the other way around. Uma Thurman has certainly looked good in some movies, but she looks haggard here.

Bottom Line: A good film about the "ugly duckling" getting the guy. Based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac story, just like Roxanne starring Steve Martin
