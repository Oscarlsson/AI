Oh! How I will never forget seeing the re-release of this film.
It was in 1974 and I could not keep my eye's from it.It is now
2006 and I still can't.What this movie is to me is a place in
my heart and being a avid collector of films from the silents
to the classics and obscure I find that very meaningful.If you
have not seen 7th you are missing out. It truly is a funtastic
film.I put this above Jason and the argonauts for my reason
alone(I KNOW I STAND ALONE IN THIS FOR JASON HAS MORE 
monsters and the great Ray Harryhausen has said JASON
is his fav.along with many of his fans).What 7th has above
Jason for me is MUSIC! A soundtrack to a film has always
been a extra push to a film and the 7th voyage has that
extra push on Jason.Bernard Herrman's score is so dreamlike
you can close your eyes and leave 7th on and the music is 
trancelike especially the snake woman dance.Please anyone
who reads this have 7th voyage in your collection(Jason
& the argonauts too for that matter).You wont be dissapointed
I will always be grateful to have seen this on the big screen
and never forget it,I hope when you watch Ray Harryhausen's
children and Bernard Herrman's music come to life you too
will not forget it.Some say Gone with the wind,Wizard of Oz
Casablanca,Citizen Kane,Jaws, Star Wars(77), Superman(78)
E.T. Titanic,2001 a space & Pulp Fiction.Not me! If I was
on a island and could only have one film from my library
(ouch!I have alot of films and alot I love)but I would
have to pick The Seventh Voyage.That would be the one 
for me on the island.And please let it be the isle of
colossus.
