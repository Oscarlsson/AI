This movie was much better than "Vanilla Sky."  "Vanilla Sky" mostly copied "Open Your Eyes" but was too obvious and less convincing.  (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.)  "Open Your Eyes" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where "Vanilla Sky" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in "Vanilla Sky" is poorly done, whereas "Open Your Eyes" represents the dream experience very well.  I recommend watching both movies before you buy one.  But if you're going to buy, get "Open Your Eyes.
