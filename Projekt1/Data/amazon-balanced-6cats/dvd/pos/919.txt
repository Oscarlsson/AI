Robert Redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions, but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl; the state of art in all its wholeness.

Redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced: good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands, if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator.

This picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious, artistic and perfect American film in the last quarter of Century; besides, the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life, enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss.

Redford' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and I really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity, the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent; and so the new directors to come, understand the true cinema meaning is ART. 

Thanks to his generous personal effort, for having created the Sundance Festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions.             

Special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years: 
Scarlet Johansson.
