This was the first silent film that I saw in its entire form. The 1927 King Of Kings, directed by Cecil B. Demille. As with D.W Griffth, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo, he is right up their amoung silent icons. This movie, starring H.B. Warner as Jesus is a truely a jewel of a film. Everyone knows the story, but it is told very well here. Demille knew his bible films, like Ten Commandments(1924,1956) Samson And Delilah and this movie, The King Of Kings. The film maybe dated a tiny bit, but can the story of Jesus be dated. I love Jesus movies, like Jesus Of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The 1961 King of Kings, and the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. And the story of Christ was also tackled in the 1916 D.W Griffth classic Intolerence. But this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail. The special effects are amazing for 1927, the crucifixion scene is astondishing,and a scene in color, which is the resurrection scene.The cast of characters is also amazing. In our era of movies, if you need a big scene, a will have only 100 people, and CGI the other tens of thousands. Since there was no CGI back in 1927, or computers for that matter, they directors like Demillie and Griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics. I know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old, they are a gateway to the past. Without those groundbreaking films, no one would care about movies. Those early silents were the catalyst for what would become. I would recommend this film.  This movie is a true classic, no matter what religion you are
