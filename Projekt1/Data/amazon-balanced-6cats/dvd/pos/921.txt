My little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie.  He goes around acting like the characters from the movie!  He really likes Harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending.  He is also convinced that they should make a Midnight Madness 2 and let Harold win the next time!  This is a great movie, with a young Michael J. Fox in it, and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie
