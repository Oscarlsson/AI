Instead of reviewing the content, my review is based more on the DVD Presentation.

Pros: The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is just excellent, with great separation of instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds for more that just audience cheering. Sound is only second to the Shakira Unplugged Dvd.

Cons: Who ever mastered this DVD must be living in 1997. This concert was recorded in HD and is usually shown on MTV HD network. The big mistake being that the concert is not Anamorphic(Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions). Sure the majority will not care, but for those of you who own HD monitors, you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the fact that you have to manually zoom in.

Second negative being that if you want to start the concert from a specific song, you have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead. Because if you try to start from the "Song Selection" menu, it will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected ends. 

Overall a great concert, but a disappointing DVD presentation
