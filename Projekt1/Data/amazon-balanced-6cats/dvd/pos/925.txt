I was blown away by the wonderful acting of Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi who played the retarded young adults. This was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability. Disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else. It was wonderful to see the love "Carla"'s siblings and parents had for her. There were 2 reasons I didn't give this movie 5 stars. One was that Diane Keaton's character of the overly controlling mother was annoying. Obviously she was supposed to be annoying, but I think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines, she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again. Another reason I didn't love this film was because Hollywood once again compels right wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal and good. Sorry, Hollywood, but there will always be those of us who still believe God's word to be true. Being a right wing nut job isn't considered normal or ok in the bible. God never created it. Look it up. You are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle.
