These days I want laughter in my life and Katt Williams gives it to you in The Pimp Chronicles.  I thought Kat Williams Live was great, but this one was better!  His tell it like it is and living life approach is great. If you can't go to see him in a live performance this is the next best thing. Be prepared to laugh so hard your sides ache.  Keep an open mind and go for the ride!
