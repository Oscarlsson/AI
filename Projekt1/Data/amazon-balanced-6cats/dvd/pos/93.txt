I like this movie.

A meeting happened in our life is very special and nearly miracle, but we don't think so almost always. The story except political things in this movie is thinkable around here.

Screenplay and performance of both Bill Nighy and Kelly McDonald have led this movie to the excellent one.

PS: I don't understand why this movie is not released in Japan
