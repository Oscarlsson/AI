I like this video for it's frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself. Like yoga, it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it. The energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches.
The quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm. I found that in itself very interesting and different.
It is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like.
She shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing, a mind bender so to speak, and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it
