This DVD is a great complement to the DVD's offered by VCE(Trinity and Beyond, Nukes in Space, etc). By itself, it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials, military equipment, and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the DVD set. The quality of the film varies between the three discs. The last Civil Defense video on Disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble, unfortunately. But, it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format.

I've owned Trinity and Beyond for several years, and I really enjoy the way it is presented. But, it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it skims over a lot of information about testing procedures, etc. You begin to get the impression that the military was doing these tests for their own amusement. After watching this DVD, I have a much better understanding of the entire process. It's easy to see why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days of the atomic weapons program. The science of the atomic bomb was a moving target, and this DVD outlines the research they made. 

Though I would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever again, their sheer power is fascinating, beautiful, and frightening at the same time. If you are interested in the science of atomic testing, you should really take a look at this set
