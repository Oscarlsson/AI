Just today I randomly selected a movie, that movie was "Henry".  I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study.

Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people.  This film does not exploit the violence though; it is very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park.

This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction(s).  I was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term.  There is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any closure.  

The DVD is great, awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, awaiting lethal injection on death row.  Very fascinating
