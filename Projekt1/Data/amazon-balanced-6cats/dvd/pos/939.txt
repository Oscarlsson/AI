I read the various reviews about the movie "The Hunter".  I was surprised at the extremeties in preference.  Much like owning a Fiero,  . . . . which I do.

The movie, as is the Fiero, is overall slower than most of McQueen's.  However, he still pulls it off, showing his great acting ability.  When you take the character, "Papa" Thorson,  he was a different breed in the wrong time era.  Who else, but McQueen could make him so realistic?

I haven't seen the movie in several years. I have been wanting a copy to add to my library.  I intend to do that today.

Oh yeah, the relationship between the movie and the Fiero?  I have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it.  I loved "The Hunter" and I love my Fiero.  For those of you who don't understand, . . . "sorry"!  Steve McQuen displayed more of his talent, even while ill.   God bless you, Steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us
