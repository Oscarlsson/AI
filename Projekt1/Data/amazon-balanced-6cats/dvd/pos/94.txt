James, you wrote: "Ben is weak, immature, a stalker, lazy, has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!"   Yes, Ben was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story.  That WAS the point of the movie.  It went right over your head!  The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out!  How could you not love this movie?  Maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value.  Watch it again in a few years.  I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time.
