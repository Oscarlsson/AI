When I hear the alarm go off and the opening strains of Henry Mancini's piano creep in, I know I'm preparing for that journey into the best alcohol induced haze of the 80s on the "Crawford Memorial Interstate-81".  Stops along the way include...

Adoption Wars

Birthday Exploitation

Unfair Life

Being Let Go

Rose Rage

Raw (Rare) Steak

One Award

Taking that special exit for "Wire Hanger Etiquette"

Christmas Propaganda

Chadwick, Love, and A Snitch

Near Death Experience

Banishment

Making Up

Soft Drink Wars

Loss

New Beginnings

New Losses

Last Moments

And Last Words before taking that final exit back to reality.
