This is a thuroughly enjoyable movie; a pleasure to watch. THe acting, characters, and story are entirely plausible, and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors, nor is there any of Hollywood's usual political preachiness (especially unusual considering Robert Redford's backing). 

THe only downside to the DVD is that it is full-screen, and not letterboxed. THe "bonus features" are somewhat lack-luster as well, and the menu system is laughable. Only one actor's credits have been updated since the movie was released, and the credits section is a token gesture at best.

Still, this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice
