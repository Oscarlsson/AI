Long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual, song and dance. I have come to believe that the 'old ways' were in many cases the superior mode of transmission. Mere words could never convey the multi-faceted beauty, wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance. This point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of 'Holo Mai Pele.'

'Holo Mai Pele' is an exciting and exotic multi-media production that I found absoultely engrossing. The director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio, the on-stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting Hawaiian landscape. The on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions, lava flows and lush tropical rainforests. All of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano Goddess Pele and her battle with her youngest sister Hi'iaka. The narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance.

This DVD serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in Hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the Hawaiian 'Spirit of Aloha.' Truly a sacred visual document to be treasured.
