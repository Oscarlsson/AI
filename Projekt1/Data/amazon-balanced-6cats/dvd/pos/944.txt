driller killer has, without question, the best director's commentary of any dvd i have ever seen. although driller killer is a far cry from his second film &quot;ms. 45&quot; it is a classic. reno can't seem to buy a thrill. despite the fact that he lives with two bombshells he can't get his painting finished to collect for the rent. his agent's reaction to his finished painting is absolutely priceless. what's worse is that his landlord has allowed a punk band to move in upstairs, adding insult to injury. the band, tony coca cola and the roosters, play &quot;the grand street stomp&quot; a guitar riff that has a great driving force. this film really documents the viallge punk circuit at the end of the 1970's. conventions are borrowed from polanski's &quot;repulsion&quot; and cassaveetes' &quot;shadows&quot;. the handheld mingling with the street people of the period shows how filthy NYC was at the time. Lots of fun. Driller Killer was meant to be listened to loud
