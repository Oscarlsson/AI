We must thank the director and salute Sigourney Weaver's beautiful performance: this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle, yet ferocious, giant mountains gorillas. It is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of Rwanda, secluded from the world. She lost much of her sanity, as well as her life, in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas. Without her work, who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction? Thanks to her work and dedication, a "lost cause" had been heard at last. 

The struggle for the survival of the "Great Apes" is not totally over though. One must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region, as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders - that happen with or without government officials' approval in each country involved - and the continuing deforestation and fauna's loss of habitat, can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved. 

One must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like Diane Fossey, conservationists around the world, and the Rwandese people in particular, who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures. All hope is not lost!
