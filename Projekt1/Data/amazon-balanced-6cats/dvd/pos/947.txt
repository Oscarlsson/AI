I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection
