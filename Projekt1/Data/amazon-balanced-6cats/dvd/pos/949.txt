What is it with the British film scene and its distinctly gritty style. It seems that if we're not producing trashy Ealing comedies, it's a shocking reality drama with the likes of Ray Winstone in it? 
Well Ray Winstone isn't in this one, but he could well be as the Rat Catcher is another one of those 'you either enjoy challenging films or you don't' pieces.
I personally love them, I guess I must be a miserable bugger! Of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass, dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate.  But it is unique (well probably not unique) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy, played by William Eadie, who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him.  
We learn that no matter what environment children grow up in, they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow.  
Without wishing to give too much away, it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since I watched it in 2000. Worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things
