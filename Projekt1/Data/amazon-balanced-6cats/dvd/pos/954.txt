"Backbeat" is an excellent portrayal of the Hamburg phase of the early Beatles, and succeeds on every level.  Although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of "fifth Beatle" Stuart Sutcliffe, the focus quickly shifts to John Lennon who (as in real life) dominated the music and lives of the early Beatles.  It is as much the story of Stu and John as the story of Stu and Astrid, and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships.  Still, it is a fascinating look at the early Beatles, who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough Reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years.  The cast is excellent, and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed.  The music is also excellent, and complements the story perfectly.  In all, "Backbeat" is an entertaining journey through the world of the early Beatles, and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings.
