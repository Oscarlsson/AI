One of the best-directed films of 2006, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences.  

And even though "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue, or to untangle the plot, one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill:  It's a Class-A tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that Shane Black pulls off here, with "KKBB"'s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy.

If that seems like an easy feat, well... Remember "1941"?  Not even Spielberg got it right.  But Shane Black nails it here -- and it's his directorial debut.

Downey & Kilmer are also at the top of their game here, but it's Michelle Monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans.

"Sui Generis" (one-of-a-kind) is the phrase that best describes "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," although it's remarkably mainstream at times.  It's a showcase of talents for everyone involved, and when the bullets aren't flying, there's even a romantic comedy here & social commentary to boot.  I can't think of any other film quite like it -- and that's just how the Warner Brothers tradition seems to work (at its best).
