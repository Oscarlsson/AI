This DVD will bring tears to your eyes.  My father was a professional violist for over 40 years and got much pleasure from this video.  My mother enjoys watching this video at least once a week.  It will inspire any young violinst to play with more feeling and overall satisfaction.  Just seeing the old footage of the great masters of long ago is worth your purchase.  If you are a lover of music, you must have this in your collection.
