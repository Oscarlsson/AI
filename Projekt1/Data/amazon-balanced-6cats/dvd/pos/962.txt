Firstly, don't let the DVD Region 1 status put you off - I am in Australia and this disc played perfectly on my PC, DVD Player and even the PS2! It's wonderful to finally see an intimate performance by Elvis Costello on DVD! It brought so many memories of his tour in 2004 back to me. Elvis Fans will love this DVD featuring his latest music, along with many oldies, it is very rare to get up close and personal with this man! Elvis gives 100% of himself on stage! A must for your music DVD collection
