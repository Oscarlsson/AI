I bought this DVD because I was getting sick of the other DVD's that claim to be pilates workouts. This pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial. I am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks.  Karen also keeps you motivated to continue.  Not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one. Beware that you need a resist-a-ring for one of the workouts though, and those can be difficult to find. Great, great workout and I would recommend it to anyone
