Let me start by saying that i love this movie and  love fulci.This was the first fulci flick i seen and when i first watched it i thought it was a little overrated,it was only after i watched the majority of his other movies that i really learned to appreciate it.(Let me explain.)this was the one of his movies that failed to shock me.When i watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from 'city' i was shocked.When i watched the nipple scene in 'ripper' i was shocked.Watching this again i realize its probably the best done of all his movies but definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the greatest(im sorry).The only reason i write this review is probably because the poor reviews of the two other two movies ive mentioned,which honestly i enjoyed more.Zombie is a great movie but nowhere near his best or goriest.(Isnt that why we watch fulci flicks?
