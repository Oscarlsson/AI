This live DVD was released as a companion to Randy Travis' "Worship & Faith" CD.  The concert was recorded on July 15, 2003 at Calvary Assmebly God Church in Orlando, Florida.  Here, Travis delivers many of the songs from the W&F album, plus "Pray for the Fish" and his country radio hit "Three Wooden Crosses."  Comments from Travis and from several fans are added in between songs.  Like its audio companion, this DVD contains a great mix of classic hymns, camp meeting songs and contemporary worship songs.  Some of the highlights include "You Are Worthy of My Praise," "Just a Closer Walk with Thee," "We Fall Down" and "Open the Eyes of My Heart."  Other noteworthy tracks include "Shall We Gather at the River," "Peace in the Valley," "Above All" and "Love Lifted Me."  Travis closes the show with "Three Wooden Crosses," the first song recorded on a Christian music label to ever top the country music charts.  "Worship & Faith" is a great DVD for lovers of worship music, lovers of country music, as well as for any and every Randy Travis fan.  This is an excellent DVD
