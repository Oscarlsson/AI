Much of the plot has been outlined above, as well as the cast and I am, in large part, in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded.

I want to add that, for anyone raised on the old Universal horror pictures, or the films directed by James Whale or Val Lewton, where the suspense is the important part of the film; this picture, Shadows and Fog, has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame! Despite the comedic elements (and there are many funny things happening) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative. The climax is dissapointing for many, but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways.

I have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse & oblique writings of Hegel, Kant and the like. I beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see Bananas or Sleeper.

Love him or hate him, you have to admit, Woody Allen is DEEP. 

A personal favorite film of mine, but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea
