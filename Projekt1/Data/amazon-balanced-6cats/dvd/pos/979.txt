This DVD is great, heck, it has the Nickel on the cover! Anyways, this DVD has a bonus feature of Mac's amazing three point flurry vs. San Antonio earlier this season - in its entirety, they used the TNT broadcast. A must have just for that alone!

It also has Franchise's game winner during opening night, Fisher's 0.4 shot, Wade's heroics, and of course the classic endings, like Rik Smit's buzzer beater vs. the Magic in 1995, Larry Bird's game-winners, and can't forget about the best one of them all, MJ's final shot in 1998. Another bonus feature is all of the recent buzzer beaters from Horry, Carter, Iverson, and Marbury
