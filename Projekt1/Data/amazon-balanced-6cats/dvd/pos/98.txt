This movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing.  It presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes.  It takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience.  It is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace.

It is full of laughs.  Joe Pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time.  I don't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of Vinny nearly as well.  Marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great.  The writing and directing, two things that often get overlooked, was wonderful.  The only weakness?  The case is a little fantastic.  It is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime.  Of course movie plots don't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it.  

Though I usually don't like excessive foul language, this movie uses it in a funny way.  I guess it wouldn't work without it...
but don't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language.  Don't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision
