I was just surfing the shelves at Borders today when I stumbled over Queen Kelly on DVD!  I couldn't believe it. I have just been getting interested in silent films (I'm 18) and of course I'm a Gloria Swanson fan (who isn't?), having seen her brilliant performance in Sunset Blvd. Anyway, I had always heard rumors about Queen Kelly - the incomplete, forgotten masterpiece. I had to pay a whopping [money] for this DVD, but it is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny.    First of all, this film is old. You can hear it creak and moan at times and the orchestra soundtrack has not aged well - let's just say the music is annoyingly intense. But the age of the film just makes it more haunting to watch. The story takes place in the 20s, but you could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago.    Now I want to concentrate on the story and the performances. Gloria Swanson's performance in Queen Kelly has to be one of her best - she was every bit as good in this film as in Sunset Blvd. We can easily see why she was such a huge silent star - her emotions and beauty carry the film just as much as the fascinating story.     This was really melodrama at its best. People tend to forget, I think, that melodrama can be an art form, stressing wistful idealism and instead of cynical realism!  The main event here is the story - wow! It's tragic that the film (and the story) were never finished. But who knows? It's just begging for a megabucks remake with Nicole Kidman. Now that the musicals are back, maybe silents will be next
