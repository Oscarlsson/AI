Truly his greatest film I have seen thus far.  Not only is one taken in by this movie, but it allows one to forget that it's filmed in black and white.  The boy, Elvis, of course, is even more beautiful in KING CREOLE.  Which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture.  The soundtrack is admirable.  He delivered it with such effervescence, such pride.  One can't help but fall in love with him and this movie. 
Too bad Elvis was so loyal to Col. Parker.  He could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be.  This film certainly promised it
