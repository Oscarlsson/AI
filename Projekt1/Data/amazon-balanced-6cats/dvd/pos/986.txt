I am from India,and Megadeth is one of the few metal bands with a huge following here.From the few bootlegs of live shows that I did manage to get hold of,this seems to be one of the best gigs ever.Mustaine's singing is as good as it gets live ( if you think it is bad,then you have'nt heard him elsewhere ).But such minor foibles aside,the gig is f'in awesome.The setlist is almost perfect.The biggest pro is that most songs have been improvised.I love that.I used to hate the fact that Megadeth played CD perfect versions of their tracks,which was not fun.I'd rather listen to the CD with better production and singing.But here,they have really streched quiet a bit and given the audience,a stellar musical show.Jimmy De Grasso ( tho' he looks a bit nervous in my opinion ) is unbelievaly tight.He looks like he is appearing for a test,when he's playing the solo on she wolf ( you can see the tension on his face),but wotta solo....the sticks alsmost blur out.The sound and picture quality is great too.My only grouse is that the band has almost no audience interaction and there's very lil bonus stuff on the CD....some soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would have rocked...they need to learn a thing or two from the 'tallica guys about this.But that apart...brilliant gig...a must for any metalhead
