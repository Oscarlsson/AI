We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date.
