I saw this flick when it first came out, and was chilled to the bone.  It was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about New York City, as well - as a cold, impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up!

Over 35 years later, on review, it is still one of the scariest movies ever made. The twists are nuanced and plentiful, as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating.  Looking for monsters?  One need only look in the mirror.

Roman Polanski was - and still is, as far as I can tell - a master manipulator of perception.  Rosemary's Baby is one of his finest films, and its timeless theme - the struggle between good and evil - unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released.

Oh, and I braved coming to New York 10 years after the film premiered.  Still here and loving the city!  I realized eventually, of course, that New York, as in so many films, was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold.  A player in the molding of the film's atmosphere - but not the cause! It could have been set anywhere, and been just as effective.
