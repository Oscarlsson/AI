This DVD is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes. First Scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record, but the ghost of Cab Crag isn't too happy about having his record broken.  Then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what's with the worm worshipers -I mean they go like whoo "a giant worm is our god, whoo we hate cars".   Then they go to the Bocephus wrestling facility.  Could they come up with a better name than Bocephus?  There's a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister.  The last episode is, by far, the best.  A hockey ghost is terrorizing the World Cup Hockey event. He's one of the toughest ghosts ever, either that, or the Russian Police are the biggest whimps ever!  I think this DVD is a good buy if you are a Scooby fan, just be prepared, it can get a little goofy.
