"The Petrified Forest" is a filmed version of the 1935 Broadway smash.  The play starred Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart and their stage performances were preserved when Warner Brothers bought the play to the screen in late 1935.  The addition of  Bette Davis made good box office sense as she was beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with Howard after their earlier matching in "Of Human Bondage".

The film is set in the Arizona desert. A killer on the run holds up in a road house taking hostage a group of people there.  The play has a few things to say about "the meaning of life" with the juxtaposition of outcast wanderer and intellectual Alan Squier played by Leslie Howard and vicious gangster Duke Mantee played by Humphrey Bogart. The morality is fairly corny now and most of it is contained in the dialogue of Leslie Howard but he delivers it superbly so it still has some resonance. The film was a breakthrough for Bogart but his performance is too theatrical for my liking. Davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and freshness which is almost unique in her career.  She is also very well photographed by Sol Polito and her big eyes glow. 

The DVD print is excellent and a lot of extras are included, including an expert and very detailed commentary about the film, a terrible Vitaphone short with the absurd Toby Wing and a funny cartoon about the Cocoanut Grove.  The radio performance included is almost unintelligible with a very poor Tyrone Power in Howard's role.

The DVD is excellent value especially if it is purchased as part of the Warners Gangster Collection.
