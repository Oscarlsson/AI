I think a lot of people miss the power of this movie.  To me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by Ministries in this country.  Even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous TV Ministries today, the message is still clear.  Those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie.  

This is certainly one of Burt Lancaster's better roles, and he plays it with much guesto! If we were to look at most of the popular Ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background.  This movie has a strong message.  Don't listen to the word of God from others.  If you must believe in the wild stories of the Bible, do so in your own way.  Do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money! Even in this modern day and age, the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong.  Mr. Bush and the Republican Party used it as a means to seek re-election!  

Everyone who is a born again Christian, or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country.  The ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived, meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the Almighty (if there is one).  Still, a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today.
