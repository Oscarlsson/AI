I thought the video was well done.  It was good to feature the clinching
games of the Division and League Championship Series plus all four games
of the World Sries.  I think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series against
Boston and Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the League Championship Series against
Los Angeles.  Still, I highly recommend this collection for all gung-ho
White Sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88
years.  A great viewing companion for those cold winter nights
