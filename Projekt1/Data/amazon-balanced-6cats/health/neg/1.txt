Expensive...and after three months of daily use I can't say it has helped my blood pressure.

I record my blood pressure every morning at the same time...after getting up from nights sleep.

I use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises.  Then breakfast and 15 minutes on Resperate Devise.

My blood pressure hasn't changed significently in the last six months and I continue to take blood pressure medicine.

The Resperate Device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule hasn't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent.

I continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but wouldn't consider buying it again
