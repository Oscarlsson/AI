I got this product after seeing the ads on tv for possibly the hundredth time.  I need to clean dirty fingerprints off my cabinets.  I opened the package.  Followed directins exactly and got nothng for my troubles.  I used the first sponge in the package.  It got less than half a cabinet door clean before it started breaking apart in my hand.  I was willing to accept that the first one was possibly defective but not the second one.  It cleaned an area smaller than the size of a quarter before it started coming apart in my hand.  I wasn't even pressing very hard.  I'll stick to my sponges with the scrubbing pads for cleaning my cabinets and other things around my house.  I'm a little ticked that this didn't last for one good cleaning let alone one good minute.
