This is the second one of these I've owned...my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half...not an uncommon problem with this, I can see reading the other reviews...But I thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer, so I bought a second one...Big mistake!

As far as the radio, what a piece of crap.  I live about 20 minuters' drive from downtown Houston...maybe there are too many radio stations around here.  It just won't lock on to anything, not even the strongest stations.  Tons of static and stations fading in and out.  I bought a pedometer with a radio because I wanted a radio while I walked.  If you're selling a pedometer with a radio, the radio should work.

I would give this 0 stars if I could
