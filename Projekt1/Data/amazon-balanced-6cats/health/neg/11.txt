I am a 20 year user of several Remington products, but I must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver.  The Remington ES-1000 Utra Smooth Bump Control Shaver was designed to replace the original (BMS) Black Man's Shaver which was discountinued several years ago.  I recently purchased and used the ES-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance.  The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the ES-1000 shaver could not and did not remove.  The product should be called "Ultra poor with a sandpaper finish."  The product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet.  For anyone with curly hair problems, you may want to consider comparing this product against the Wahl 5-Star Series, Model # 8061.  I think you will find there is a major difference in the products
