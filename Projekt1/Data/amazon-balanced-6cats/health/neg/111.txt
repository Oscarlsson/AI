Oprah Winfrey and Kevin Costner the leading medical researchers in America think this is a great break through. Well gee, if they like it you must too. There is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers "guarantee" that this works. After you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening. Well it probably is, in your psyche. If that and Kevin Costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead. Can't seem to find the "guarantee" on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you'll be the first to benefit
