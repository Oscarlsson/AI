I paid $45 for this aesthetically pleasing scale.  Sure it looks nice, but if it doesn't do its job, it's not much of an accessory for the bathroom.

It took me a while to figure out how the scale works.  There are a lot of beeps involved.  Essentially, to program your info, you start by pressing 
the mode button, adjust your height, press mode, adjust your age, press mode, select your gender, press mode, select between normal and athlete, press mode and you will hear a beep to confirm. Then to store, press either the up button for memory #s 1,3 and 5 or the down button for #s 2,4 and 6, press mode and there will be another beep to confirm.

Still with me?  If you just want your weight, you just step on the scale, but if you want to get your body fat and water %, you must press the up or down button to find your memory #, then press mode and wait for the beep before you step on the scale.

Now I don't know about you, but this procedure is a lot more cumbersome than any other scale I owned.  So fine, I've now figured out how to work the thing.  Getting even somewhat accurate results are another thing.

When I stepped on the scale, I would sometimes be surprised by the weight.  I didn't think I could gain 7 pounds in one day (I eat very healthy and my weight range is usually between 3-4 pounds).  But if you step on the scale again, like some other digital scales, it seems to remember your last weight and won't give you your real weight.  So I have to put some other object on it to get a reading and then the scale resets.  I step on the scale again and my weight is now 6 pounds less than the original reading!

The body water % didn't fluctuate too much and the body fat % was 3% higher than the reading on the last scale I owned (Conair Thinner brand).  

All in all, I am returning this scale and going back to the drawing board in finding something that is even the least bit accurate.
