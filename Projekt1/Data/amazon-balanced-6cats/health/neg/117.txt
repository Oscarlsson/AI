I bought this from ioniczone themselves. IT does not work.
I kept it on for an entire month, the filter was never dirty at all.
Also, this unit is extremely small, the pic is rather misleading

I was however able to return the unit to the office in NV, had to make 2 phone calls and the person was very polite.

I went on to buy one from IonicPro,and what a difference it was, filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so and it was really dirty.
