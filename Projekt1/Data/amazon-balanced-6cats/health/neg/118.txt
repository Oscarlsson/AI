This product has not been certified that the harmful mercury has been distilled out.

By chance I read an article today in the Jan. 16 issue of Time by Andrew Weil, M.D. He advises strongly that fish oil be mercury free. Weil also lists the mercury free fish species to buy. He recommends Anarctic krill oil. Amazon has it but it is expensive. 

I guess I'll throw out the almost full bottle of Nature Made. Read up on it. Mercury is bad stuff
