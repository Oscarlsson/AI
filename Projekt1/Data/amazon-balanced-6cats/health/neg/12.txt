I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product
