I own a Swiffer Wet Jet, and I am sorry I wasted my money. I don't know how effective this is on other surfaces, but I use it for my Brazilian Chestnut Hardwood Floors. Along with the cleaning solution that Swiffer markets for Hardwood. I use this product exactly as instructed and my beautiful hardwood floors costing over $40,000 come up with smears and smudges like you wouldn't believe. I realize that this is a cheap quick fix for dirty floors, but when you add in the fact that you contnually have to buy pads and cleaning solutions, it really isn't all that inexpensive the ONLY thing this product has gong for it is it's convienence, and technically, since I have to go over all of the floors again after using it to get rid of the smears and smudges, it really isn't that convienient either. So really this product is a BIG DUD for Hardwood floors at least.
