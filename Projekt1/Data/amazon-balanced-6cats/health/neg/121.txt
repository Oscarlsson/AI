When I bought this I had gotten sick of using a mop and bucket and really needed something faster. It doesn't cut it for a few reasons:

1. Solution left a streaky, dull floor. Mop & Glo with water works MUCH better.

2. Bottle only lasted 3 times for a very small kitchen.

3. Need to put batteries in the device (something I didn't realize when I bought it).

4. Not "cleaner than a mop." If you have a heavy-traffic floor like I do, you'd have to use about 3 clean pads on the floor to keep from pushing dirt around. A mop at least can be rinsed.

5. Bottle is impossible to refill. I might have stuck with it if I could have replaced the solution with a water/Mop & Glo mix, but they have the bottle fixed so you can't.

*sigh* I'm actually considering spending the $$$ for a "Scooba." We have a Roomba vac for the living room and it is a dream. If you want something fast, stick with "Swiffer Wet." No batteries, no solution to refill
