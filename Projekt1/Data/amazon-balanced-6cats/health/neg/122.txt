I've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment, and I figured this would suit my mopping needs.  It hasn't.

Even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the WetJet, I've found that it doesn't really pick any dirt up.  What I wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere.  I'm even using the "special" hardwood floor solution- it isn't making a difference.  I don't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor (and there are probably better solutions for that as well)
