This thing is unbelievably lame. It doesn't massage. It vibrates. Y'all have sat in massage chairs before at Sharper Image or Brookstone. They can be really good, with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage.

This thing doesn't even resemble those chairs. Trust me. I am sitting in one now. It is my main office chair. I have not turned on the "massage" function, or even plugged it in, since about three days after I bought it.

The "massage" feature is more like an annoy feature. It just shakes you around a bit, but doesn't actually feal good in any way.
