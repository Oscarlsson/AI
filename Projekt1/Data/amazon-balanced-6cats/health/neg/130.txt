Old Spice is a great-smelling cologne and I've worn it for years. My dad wore it when I was growing up and I remember he almost always smelled of it. It's a great cologne for lean, athletic guys who love retro; it's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men. It takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff. The smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention, otherwise he'll just be annoying. Old Spice Cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time; exposing it to heat helps to age it (leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building). Trust me, it smells awesome if you let it age. I meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle. I'm proud to say I'm carrying on the tradition of wearing Old Spice cologne. It's  not nerdy and it's not just for older men. It's a cologne for any masculine guy. It smells great
