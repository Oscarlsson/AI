I bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son's fast growing hair.  He's got thick hair that we like to keep "buzzed" short.  The first time I used the clippers, he complained that they really pull at the hair.  I realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair I buzzed.  The little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair.  I've decided to send it back.  Reasonably priced but not worth the pain.  NOT RECOMENDED FOR THICK HAIR
