So I bought two of these bottles, got them home, and discovered the first time I used them that every time you take a sip of water, they SQUEAL like a drowning mouse. It was unbelievably embarassing. The store refused to take them back, so I contacted the company directly...and ended up in a back-and-forth email exchange with an extremely rude person in customer servide who insisted I was WRONG, that the bottles didn't squeal and I was just using them incorrectly. She offered to replace the caps after I wrote back and explained that it was a WATER BOTTLE, for God's sake, "using" it wasn't exactly rocket science. BUT she'd only replace them AT MY EXPENSE, which after shipping worked out to be almost what the bottles originally cost. DO NOT BUY THESE BOTTLES!
