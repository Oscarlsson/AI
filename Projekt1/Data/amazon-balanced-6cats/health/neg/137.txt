Ok, I'll admit, the nail clippers rock.  I have no problem using them, they are sharp, cut evenly and are the perfect width.  That said, throw everything else out.  The bulb syringe is useless, keep the one that you get from the hospital.  Get an ear thermometer, it's a heck of a lot easier.  The spoon...not even going there.  The med dropper isn't easy enough to use.  My suggestion?  Go find a syringe with a cork attachment.  You take the top off the bottle, push the cork attachment into the opening.  To use, flip back the attached lid and put the med syringe into the opening, flip the bottle over and draw the med into the syringe.  This is the best way to do it.
