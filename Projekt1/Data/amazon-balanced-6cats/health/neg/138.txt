This is a nice idea, but the individual components are poor in quality. The nasal aspirator doesn't get enough suction. Of course, I've never found an aspirator at the store that did work as well as the one we got from the hospital. Do yourself a favor and just ask for an extra one before you're discharged from the hospital. Second, the thermometer takes FOREVER to get a reading, and it doesn't beep or anything to let you know it's finished. The clippers are okay, but I've definitely used better ones that were just a buck or two. Never used the medicine dropper because the pharmacy gives you one for free when you get a prescription, and other baby medications (Tylenol, Motrin, PediaCare, etc) come with their own specially calibrated dispensers. The medicine spoon? Give me a break. My daughter balked at that one the one time I did try to use it
