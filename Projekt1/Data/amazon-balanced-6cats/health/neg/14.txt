Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing... it's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff (fits arms 9 to 13 inches around) and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff!
Don't bother calling Omron "Customer Service" at 1-800-634-4350... just a typical big company voice mail hell! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece...
My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons "customer service
