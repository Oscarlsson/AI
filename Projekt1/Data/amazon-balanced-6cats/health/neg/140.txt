      Pure junk.  I've tried this several times.  It doesn't repair  scratches but covers the lens with a sheet of clear gunk.  The first trick is to spread the material evenly and smoothly over the surface.  And the second trick is to try to get your money back. The method of spreading it evenly is not well worked out by the product makers.
