Just received two of these. Yes, how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it.  The quality of the casing is really poor.  The plastic is very flimsy feeling.  The labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box. They show signs of just simply being really old.

The instructions are written in many languages which is fine, but there are things they fail to tell you.  I also ordered the Juice AA 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead. The charger blinks red with those batteries, but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means.  

If you go to the juicebattery website, they do not mention this product anywhere.  Not even when you search for it. A good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product.  The company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now.  

As with many things, made in CHINA!

I got a few more days yet before I need to return them via Amazon's return policy which as we all know, ROCKS!
