It warms ok, not great. But the worst thing is, the massage is LOUD! I work at home, in my basement, where it gets cold, and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm, and was excited to get massage too. However, I can't use the massage feature while I am on the phone - it is way too loud. And there is no control on the heating element, just on and off. A disappointment. I still use the heat feature, but also wear thick socks
