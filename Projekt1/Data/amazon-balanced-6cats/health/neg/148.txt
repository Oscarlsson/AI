This is my first purchase that I have been unhappy with.  The tingler arrived with two of the tingles off.  Attempts to put them back on were unsuccessful.  I had attempted to email customer service three separate times and have received no response.  I would appreciate either a refund or a new one sent to my address.

The tingler was to be part of a massage Christmas gift for my wife.  I would appreciate your time in this matter.

Thanks,
