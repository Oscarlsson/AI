While the pedal exerciser mechanically works fine, the plastic or something on it smells so bad it is not pleasant to keep inside.  I have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better.  I called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but don't have any solutions.  I asked if they had a website I could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2-3 months.  Right.
