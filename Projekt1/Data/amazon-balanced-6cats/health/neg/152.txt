I also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months.  I REALLY loved this machine though!  It actually blew air!  And it has the nice SAFE switches unlike the toggles that most have now.  I had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while I was gone and almost burned the place down.  So anyway, I'm trying to contact the manufacturer, but I doubt it will do any good.  Too bad.  Loved it while it worked.  Hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before I saw the reviews
