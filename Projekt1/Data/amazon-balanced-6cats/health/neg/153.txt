I figured for the price, how could you go wrong? Well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether. No HOT air, No Cold air...NOTHING!! This Item looks like a great deal..but Save your $$$ and buy something that will last you longer than 2-1/2 months. The manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product!
