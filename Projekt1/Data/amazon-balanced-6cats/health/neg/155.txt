You sent it to the wrong address. I never recieved it.. I spent hours and hours trying to get the address corected.. Then I spent hours and days trying to cancell the order.. Your customer service rates a D- !!! to say the least. finally I got a credit for the Item. But you wouldn't give me credit for the shipping!!  I was RIPPED OFF.
