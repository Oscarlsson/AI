These glasses arrived yesterday and are the cheapest, poorly made, and most awkward glasses I have ever tried on. They are uncomfortable and look and feel as if they were purchased in the 10 cent bin at the local dollar store. Pure garbage. Don't waste your money.

[...] I can't imagine that any consumer would think of these in a positive manner.
