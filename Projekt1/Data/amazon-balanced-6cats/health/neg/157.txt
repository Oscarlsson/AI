This product is not even directionally accurate.  It said that my body fat percentage was 10% higher than actual.  Then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25% body fat.  Perhaps we had a lemon, but I am taking this back because it is very inaccurate.  In fact, this is the first review I have ever written because I want to warn people about this product.  Please do not waste your money
