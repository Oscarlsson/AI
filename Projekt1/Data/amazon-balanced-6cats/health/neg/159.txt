I had such high hopes for this hair dryer -- well-known brand, diffuser with long "fingers" just like I prefer, etc.  Well the first time I used it my hair looked like I had been through a wind tunnel!  The low setting is like most other hair dryers' high settings, even with the diffuser on.  It really blasts the air out!  I have wavy/lightly curly hair and it made my hair a frizzy mess.  This dryer may be fine for people with straight hair, but I definitely do not recommend it for people with wavy or curly hair
