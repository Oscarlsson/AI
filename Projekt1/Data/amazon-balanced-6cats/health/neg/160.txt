I was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it.  It is very heavy and I am not a weakling!  It is also very big.  With my arm stretched out all the way I can barely get it to my head.  Because it is so heavy and big I have 'banged' myself on the head with the 'fingers'.  Just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer.
