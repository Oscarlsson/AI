Razor blades are expensive enough as it is, and the trend of "more is better" has reached almost ludicrous points in the industry.  What's that?  Five blades, you say?  Why, it must be better than four!  Meh.

I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck.  The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.

Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra "trimming" blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.  

However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I'm used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I'm exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend
