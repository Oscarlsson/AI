I began using Gillette's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher. 

I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to "migrate" its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I'm lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to. 

What's the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3
