When the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit.
The power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge.   You cannot replace the regargable battery yourself!
Sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one.
As for the shave: not bad, but not exceptional either.
The cutters a very tiny, not built to last, and are not durable.
All rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used.
This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch.  I also have a braun and a norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine, the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - I heavy duty clean them in 97% alchohol about once a year, and brush out debris about once every 7 uses, these units dont have batteries and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available.
The Remington shaver really needs to have it's cutter blades cleaned (brushed off or washed) after every use (what a Pain)!
I find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver - than one that will last
