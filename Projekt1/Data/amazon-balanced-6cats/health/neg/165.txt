I've been using this shaver for almost a year, and am disappointed with it.

For years, I've used the older style Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism. I suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to it. I find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because I feel like I'll drop it otherwise.

The big problem is with the screen. Try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen. Otherwise, the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood.

To clean, it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky. If not very careful, it goes on unevenly and gets stuck. With practice, it usually works the first time.

The funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall. It looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s
