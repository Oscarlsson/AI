I don't know where Amazon got these cases of All Small & Mighty, Free Clear.  I use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it.  From my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo.  The Amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint.  It also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version.  At the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout.  The Amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a non-dripless spout.  At first I called the manufacturer.  Their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call.  So I decided to use it.  I do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes.  

I would not purchase this again from Amazon.  The price is not that great to overcome the odd differences.  I will, however, continue to purchase this product from my local retailers
