This morning I spilled coffee on my "million dollar" white dress shirt.  It left me with three large coffer stains.  I remembered that I had my Tide To Go in the car.  After drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions, most of the coffee stains had disappeared....what remained, however, were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread.  So, most of the coffee stain was gone, but I'm left with the unsightly rings...not quite as noticeable, but there're still there.
