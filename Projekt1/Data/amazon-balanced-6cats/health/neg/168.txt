These glasses were a bit of a disappointment.  The convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit - they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment.  And actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use.  Great idea but maybe some "fine tuning" would help...like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck.
