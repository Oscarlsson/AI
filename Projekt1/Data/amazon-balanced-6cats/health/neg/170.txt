This product just doesn't cut my nose hair as close as the Panasonic it replaced. If I could remember the model of the Panasonic, I would mention it in this review. I hope I can find the manual for the Panasonic so I can get another one.

Beware that many of the new designs are going this rout (even Panasonic). The manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration, but I think its more of a liability issue on their part (someone probably got sued for a nicked nose). I just won't buy their products anymore if they're going to design them for marginal performance
