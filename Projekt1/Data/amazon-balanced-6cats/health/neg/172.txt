As far as I can tell, even after following directions to the letter, I found the readings to be wildly inaccurate. For example, in the morning I got a reading of 89 over 79.  In the afternoon it was 188 over 155.  Then a bit later it was 155 over 150, nearly a flat line indicating death.  At my doctor's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78.  It's a wonder this little machine didn't cause me to keel over just from shock.  I don't recommend it to anyone. Mine is on its way back to Amazon
