This unit has all marketing features, Date, Time,  Memory stores up to 48 prior readings by date & time, but there is one problem its not acurate. My Doctor said Wrist Cuffs can be -10% off just because of taking the reading at the wrist and not on the arm next to the heart, just like taking your bp on the right arm. The further from you heart the lower your readings.
Example: The doctor takes my BP then I take it with the cuff monitor  He/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min. We tried it several times and each time it was incorrect. So he told me not to use it.  I bought a simular unit, no date, time on the screen, but stores 99 prior readings, tested again with the doctor's nurse and found it to be within limits. She said you never get the same reading twice in a row. Some nurses & doctor's even take three readings and take the average.
