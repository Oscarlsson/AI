I am an African American woman with long, chemically relaxed hair. As a full-time undergraduate student, I cannot afford to visit the salon on a weekly basis. I purchased this flat iron on a whim at the market because my previous flat iron had recently shorted out (it was an older model with no swivel cord). I chose this flat iron because it was the same brand as my last one, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with its performance. I cannot say the same for this product. 

In retrospect, it does exactly what it claims to do, but nothing beyond that. With my previous flat iron, I could straighten and style my layered hair at the same time, which significantly cut the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure. Any attempts to style my hair were underwhelming to say the least. After using the flat iron, my hair looked fizzy and unkempt, and even a bit damaged. Any curls I managed to produce looked undefined and limp. It was by chance that I purchased a curling iron in addition to the flat iron, and was able to successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control serum. 

Needless to say, you won't be able to produce that "fresh from the salon" look with this flat iron, which is sadly exactly what I needed. I do not feel confident about my hair when stepping out of the house after using this product. If you don't use this tool for anything but sleek, straight looks and have a bottle of frizz serum handy, then this is a great product for you. While I am not happy with its results, it will have to do for now. I'll be saving for a better iron while praying that straightening AND curling my hair doesn't leave it severely damaged.
