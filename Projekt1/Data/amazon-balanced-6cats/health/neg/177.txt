I bought this straightener TWO times..the first time i had it for about 8 months. My friend had bought the straightener and I fell in love, so I bought my own. The first 8 months were heaven. I straightened my hair all the time. Then, at 8 months, one of the plates stopped working! For a while i used it, but it took forever, and didn't straighten my hair well at all. I decided to buy another, thinking that it was just a defect on the first. I bought the other and it didn't work nearly as well as I had remembered! In fact, it stopped heating up all together within 3 months!! Another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well. We have both decided against buying this one again, obviously, and I would reccommend you do, too. I have heard that the newest Conair straightener is wonderful, and comes with a two-year warranty, so I wouldn't have to pay again, if it did the same thing to me that this one did. DON'T BUY IT! unless, of course, you enjoy being ripped-off..
