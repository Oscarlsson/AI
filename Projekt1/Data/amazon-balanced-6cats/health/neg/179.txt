I have gone through 3 of these straighteners (i know, you think I would have learned!) however, my first one was lost, my second one stopped working in a matter of months, and the third one stop working in less than a month!! I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well. Unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works (causing obvious problems). I would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive, but I think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for
