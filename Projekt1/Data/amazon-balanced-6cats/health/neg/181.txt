I've had this straightener for about 3 months - I loved it at first but now it's a love/hate relationship. The "gold" plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use. The effect, my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff! To make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates. I gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair, something that is hard to do!
This is the second store brand straightener I've purchased with poor results. Save your $$$ and buy a professional model from a hairdresser - it's cheaper in the long run
