I would give this product negative 50 stars if I could.  
I paid beaucoup for several very plain bras (no lace or other embelishments) and didn't wear or wash the bras until I received the BraBaby.  I assumed the BraBaby would protect my bras in the wash, as that's what the product claims to do. Imagine my suprise when I pulled my bras out of the washer (and out of their respective "Bra Demolition Cages") to find them RUINED.  I'm talking not wearable.   The straps of both brand new, never worn, previously mint condition bras were hanging out all over the place and looked like they had been chewed by an animal.  Both bras had dents in the molded cups.  Then I saw that one of the bras had two noticeable rips on the cup!  I nearly flipped out!  
I think my bras would've been better "washed" had I thrown them into the center of a pack of rabid fighting mad dogs.  The only positive thing to report is that Amazon refunded my money.  
Back to hand washing my bras and back to the mall I go to replace the ripped bra.  Perhaps the other with it's dented cups will be suitable for Halloween?
