I bought this product with great expectations that it would save my not-so-inexpensive Victoria Secret bras from excessive wear in the washing machine. It does do this, though the product is not very user friendly when your bra is fairly large cupped. I suppose if you have smaller cupped bras, this device works wonderfully. As for the larger DD or bigger cups, you have to tuck and there is a large overlap on the smaller interior ball. Also, another problem I have found is that the larger cups with underwire are REALLY hard to use with this ball. Again, due to the size of the larger cups. Otherwise, I would think that this is a great product for use with smaller cupped bras
