It did what it was supposed to do, and my bras came out of the wash without any weird creases.  However, some bras hold up better in the washing machine than others, and I think the one I put into the BraBABY was one of the more durable ones.  
While it does what it's supposed to, it definitely is not easy to use.  I had difficulty putting a B-size cup in without squishing the bra.  The clasp is also badly designed.  If it breaks, it's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed, but the whole thing is poorly engineered.  I think it was made even harder seeing as how I tried using the BraBABY with a front-closing racer back.
In the end, I think it would have been easier and just as effective to use a lingerie bag.
I don't recommend this product
