Amazon and this company are NIGHTMARES.  I ordered this scale a month ago, and the expected ship date keeps changing.  I finally called Amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever.  He was no help at all.  After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade.  All he was able to give me was the ship date range, which has already changed several times.  Amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time
