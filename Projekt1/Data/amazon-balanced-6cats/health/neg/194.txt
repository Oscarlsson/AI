This is the first time in my life I have been inspired to come online and write a review of a product.

When I first saw the ad for this on TV, I thought it sounded like just what I needed.  I rushed to the store, but it wasn't even on sale yet.  Finally I found it yesterday at walgreen's- and I hate to say- it stinks!

I have just below shoulder length curly hair.  I generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- I hate spending a lot of time on my hair.  But once in a while I straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush, and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish.  I am not very good with a hair dryer, and it takes me a long time and I find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer, and I don't do a very good job.  Plus then I need to use the iron too, and it takes me a good 30-45 min total.

So I thought this product would be great.  All in one! A time-saver! Easier to use!

Well, I was wrong.

First of all, it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer.  It's not very powerful.  Next, it was barely straight!  Even on the "4" setting, there wasn't much tension at all.  It left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight.  So after an hour, I had hair that was not as straight as if I had just dried it alone- and I still needed to use the flatiron.

Don't be fooled.  It will NOT give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box.

I just hope I can return it.
Guess I will stick with my CHI iron for now.

I *might* try the "long hair" version of this dryer to see if that's any better
