We have three of these humidifiers, the elephant, the penguin and the cow.  Have had them for 6 months or so.  In the last two weeks, both the penguin and cow have stopped working all together and the elephant is the sole survivor.

When we got them, I thought they were amazing, quiet and did the job. Now I am deciding if I should go out and buy two more or pick another brand.

Oh and be careful, I think the steam from my sons killed his DVD player on his TV as it gets caked with the white stuff....
