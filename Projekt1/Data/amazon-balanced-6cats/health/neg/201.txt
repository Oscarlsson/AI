This Water Jet has a button on the handle just like the WaterPic. You push it to temporarily stop the flow of water. Here's a warning: it can take a lot of finger pressure to stop the flow of water especially if you have adjusted the dial for a hard flow. If you lack ordinary strength in your fingers stay away from this machine. I don't have a finger strength problem yet several times I've squirted water all over the bathroom because somehow I hadn't pushed hard enough on the stop button.

I had purchased a WaterPik, but had trouble with it leaking, and so purchased this Conair. The WaterPik is a much better quality product. The Conair seems to be very cheaply made, and I am not very happy with it. I am going back to using my WaterPik even though it occasionally springs a leak.
