The razor isn't bad, but the cleaning system is a joke.  Mine wouldn't release the razor & kept recleaning it.  Plus, and I am surprised that this isn't mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor, the cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of gimmick) stinks like metal solvent.  Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price
