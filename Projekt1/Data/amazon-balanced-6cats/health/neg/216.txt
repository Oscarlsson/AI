I bought this epilator solely for upper lip hair, it takes off most of it but I dont think it epilates coz u can still see minute hair which wont be caught up in the blades and also the hair regrow in 2-3 days...much like shaving it off. I would rather goto the salon every 2 weeks than use this every 3rd day. Moreover, on underarms, it pains as much as the other epilators so if you already have one, dont waste your money on this one
