OK folks, this is a relatively low quality starter kit from a really decent company.  The Art of Shaving products in general are really nice, albeit a tad pricey.  This small kit gives you a nice sample of an entire line of shaving products that work nicely together.  The full sized items will cost you about $75 - $100 total.  

The included brush is a "toss away" quality brush.  This is not just my opinion, but a quote from the manager at an Art of Shaving store.  My advice is to get some samples from a department store, then purchase the Art of Shaving shave cream (wow! a great product) here on Amazon, plus either the Tweezerman Badger Brush for $15 or a Best Badger Brush from Crabtree & Evelyn for $35.
