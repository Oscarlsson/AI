It puts out a cloud of water vapor and it's not all that noisy but I had no idea I'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart, wiping it down, trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down, refilling the tank twice a day, and wondering why this humidifier doesn't have an automatic shuftoff in case I forget to turn it off. At least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find. However, this is too much like an unwanted hobby so I'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room
