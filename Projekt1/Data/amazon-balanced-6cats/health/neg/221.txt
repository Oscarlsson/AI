Maybe it's my own fault, but I didn't get that from the product description.  It's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night.  It's also really noisy.  I am probably comparing to my last (normal sized) humidifier ( a vicks something or other, no longer available) which was great and lasted 3 years, until hard water built up too much limescale... I would have cleaned more if I'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it
