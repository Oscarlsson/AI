The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses.  But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves.  They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle.  Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair.  These did not.  So they do not tweeze well at all.  Wasn't worth all the bother of a return.  I just threw it away.  It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made.
