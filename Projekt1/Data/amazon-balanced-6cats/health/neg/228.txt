I am on my second Zadro LED Lighted Fogless Mirror - Yes, customer service was decent and they sent me a new one. However, the initial problem was repeated plus some -- it fogs up despite following directions, using their spray, and using words I shouln't repeat here. Additionally, the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months. One good thing is that  suction cups still hold it up as long as I press them in every week. This product has problems which make a mockery of its "ZFogless" claim. Save yourself the trouble -- don't buy it
