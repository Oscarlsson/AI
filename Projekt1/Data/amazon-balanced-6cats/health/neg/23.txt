While I am not sure what exactly these do taste like, I don't detect the peanut butter here. The texture is good, chewy enough, but the taste is...odd. Not at all sweet. I can't imagine any child (or adult) grown accustomed to high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these. Bleh. 

If you want peanut butter, the Clif Bar has a much better flavor (and an even denser, chewier texture). If you want a Z-Bar, I slightly recommend the chocolate--although it too tastes a bit odd and is inferior to the chocolate Clif Bars. Builder Bars are also worth a try, sufficiently sweet and flavorful. Of course, with these alternative product lines you will get about twice the calories. 

Although I will not buy these again, I give the company a star for a worthy effort
