I was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back.  However, immediately after opening the product, I tried to plug it in, as it doesn't work without batteries being fully charged.  Unfortunately, this massager would plug in but did not start charging, and therefore, it could not be charged.

I will be returning this item
