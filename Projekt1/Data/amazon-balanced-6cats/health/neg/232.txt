Two main problems with this "cordless massager". The first being that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. You may get an hour use on a full charge, and that shows diminishing power as it goes. Add to that it's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment. If you're looking for something to rumble a slight bit, this is for you. Otherwise, save your money
