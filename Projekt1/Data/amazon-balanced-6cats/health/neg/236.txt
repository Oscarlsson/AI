I was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave I was looking for.  It also was taking me much longer to shave because I had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs.  In the end, after using it for 5 weeks, I took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver.  I am back to my razor blade.  I still hate shaving
