The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion.  Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is.

The key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol.  The gel has menthol, so that's why it can be irritating.  I read a review of shaving basics online, and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol.  The lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and is quite soothing
