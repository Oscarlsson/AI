The wieght is accurate, but the body fat is way off. I had my body fat done 6 months ago by a doctor and I was 12% six months later I wiegh 5 lbs less and the scales says I'm 25%. something is off and I trust the doctor. If all you want is to see your wieght its fine, but the rest... well find another scale
