I bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option.  It was not easy to use, as you HAVE TO put in your information unless you want to use kilograms, and you still have to enter your height in meters.  All that aside, it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15%.  Am I an athlete?  No.  Am I female? Yes.  Is 14% body fat possible???  Well let's just say it is HIGHLY unlikely.  I can't comment on the water numbers it gives me because I don't really have anything to go on there, but even at my fittest I was over 20% body fat, and that was a while ago..
