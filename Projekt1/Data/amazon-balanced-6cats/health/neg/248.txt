This scale does not weigh correctly. Your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in. I counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time I used it. This is one of the least accurate scales I've ever used.

Spend the extra money to get a higher quality non-digital scale
