There are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff. It's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin C.
A completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product. 
Supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices. If you want an energy drink try Rockstar or Monster. If you want to support the troops buy a savings bond
