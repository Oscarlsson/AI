I had an old Caruso molecular setter that finally conked out.  I thought the ion feature of this would be great.  The clicking is annoying, but if it worked, I wouldn't mind.  This puts out WAY less steam, causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system.  Then, after all that, it only curls about 1/2 as much.  So, it takes longer for less curl--not worth it.  I hope I can get another Caruso, but I hear they have problems now, too.  Ahhhh, remember the good old days when things worked
