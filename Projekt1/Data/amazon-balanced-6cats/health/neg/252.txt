I was just given this set- new- and was impressed by the reviews. I'm not sure if it's just my hair, but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer. I figured I needed to work out the kinks and give it another try. Again same look and that's all the curl I have after 20 minutes. Concept is good- just doesn't work on my fine, full head of hair. If you want curl stick to the hot rollers.
