Ok I picked up a corded Vidal Sassoon hairclipper at Target. The thing was so absolutely horrible that I had to come to Amazon to vent about it. The blades seemed blunt, if not nonexistent. It would only cut little tufts of hair, and the hair had to be taut, literally held by my fingers. It literally tried to rip the hair out of my head. My follicles still hurt from the hour or so I spent trying to shave my head with this terrible clipper. Most of the hair I actually successfully removed, was due to scissors. Lubrication and blade adjustment with the screwdriver had no effect--the blades weren't *stuck*, they just *suck.*

I don't care how much money Vidal Sassoon spends trying to portray themselves as the trendy cutting edge in fashion maintenance--judging from this horrible experience, they really, really do not know how to make a decent hairclipper. I have shaved my head plenty of times over the last few decades, and I have seen some bad clippers, but never have I experienced a clipper that was so bad that it would probably be bested by a haircut given by a sharpened stone instead.
