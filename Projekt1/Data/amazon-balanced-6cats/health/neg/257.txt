I've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned.  I have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week.  The length adjuster on the side of the clippers doesn't hold.  If the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down.  Tightening the screw didn't help either.  The attachments don't fit right, especially the blend attachment.  This attachment can only be used if you don't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull.  The only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck
