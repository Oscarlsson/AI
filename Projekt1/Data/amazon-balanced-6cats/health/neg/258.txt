I've used this trimmer only twice, but my initial opinion will lead me to return it.  When trimming my moustache, it's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose.  

I used it to cut my sons hair, but it kept binding up and pulling his hair.  I ultimately gave up and returned to the old Oster clippers I have.  They buzzed right through with no problem.

I'll be sending this item back
