This item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks I bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and I only wear it 4-6 hours a night. This product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so. I like the design and it doesn't cut up my mouth but I can't be replacing it every other month
