After doing extensive research on the web, I purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor. While the Easy Fit cuff was easy to place, the B/P readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous B/P cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor's office.  Since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings, I returned the B/P cuff to Amazon for a refund.
