I was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when I found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early.  I tried fiddling with the DST setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than I wanted.  The brightness may be a problem for some people but I found it reasonable.  Overall a good docking station, but a poor alarm clock
