Don't be fooled by the similar-sounding, inarticulate reviews--this product is not what you think it is. It contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation. The "energy fields" described have nothing to do with actual energy/electricity--they might as well use the word "aura" for all of the logical sense it makes. 

In the words of a company representative:

The Tingler is not battery operated there is no button. That would be our Sqwiggler which has 2 AA batteries located in the handle.  You're welcome to return the Tingler for a Sqwiggler.  The Sqwiggler is $29.95 Please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $9.95 plus $8.45 for the shipping fees. 

Make your own judgement, but don't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you'll be
