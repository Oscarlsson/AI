I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington. I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver. Big mistake. After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver. How can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave... but it does.
