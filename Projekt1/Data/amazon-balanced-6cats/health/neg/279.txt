The scale is everything the manufacturer claims. However, with minimal use by one average sized adult, our scale lasted only about nine months. The balance part of the scale is very sound, but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components. I suspect that poor Q&A will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere. Today, my scale will not function unless I hold the batteries by hand (not too practical when someone is standing on it...). 

Conclusions:
* Scale design is nice--looks good.
* Construction of balance components is solid, glass is very strong.  Design and construction of the power unit (battery) is rather poor.
* Scale functions as advertised for a normal sized (80kg/175lb) adult ... until the battery power clip dies.
* Buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections.

Hope this helps!
