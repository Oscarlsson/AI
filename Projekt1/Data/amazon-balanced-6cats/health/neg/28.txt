Why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water?! How many calories does water have to begin with?! It would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial(?a cheeseburger?). Please do NOT buy this. Fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to.... NO CALORIES! Give the money that you would have spend to charity. The makers of this water are thieves and con artists
