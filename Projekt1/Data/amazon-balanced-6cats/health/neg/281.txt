I bought this straightener because I wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp. However, while it is not a horrible product, I have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better. I would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store. This isn't any better than those
