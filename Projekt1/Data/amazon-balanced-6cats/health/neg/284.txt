I purchased the Kaz Ultra King Size Heating Pad off eBay to replace another Kaz heating pad that stopped working after 2-3 months.  Well, this is no different except I now have more expensive heating pad that is useless.  Just like the other reviewers, my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process.  I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time.  I also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds, sometimes two or three at once.  Nothing worked.  Its was nice while it lasted-- heated well without getting too hot.  It is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months.  Thumbs down!

DO NOT PURCHASE A KAZ SOFTHEAT HEATING PAD IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY.
