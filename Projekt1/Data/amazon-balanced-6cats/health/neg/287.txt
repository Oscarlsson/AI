I had the exact same experience as Stan, another reviewer. I bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off, I could not get it started again. Like Stan, I thought it was a fluke and bought another. Same problem, two days after buying the pad. I have looked in four stores in the Seattle area and cannot find another brand of heating pad. This one should not be on the market. I am sending both pads back to the manufacturer
