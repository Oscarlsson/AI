I ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover, instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once ... well, they do have a different cover, but the listing on Amazon didn't say that the pads SHUT-OFF after ONE HOUR.  I am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself, and don't need/want any auto shutoff.  These two heating pads are going right back.  I can get the regular heating pads that don't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price
