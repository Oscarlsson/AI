I purchased this humidifier, and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week. One night, it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again. I called the company, who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out, and they would be sending a new one to replace it (with no cost for shipping to me). I received the new one a week later, which to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember the name but it also began with the word "sun." So far, the new humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs. every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment. The process of replacing, however, was very smooth and also free so I'll give them 2 stars for that
