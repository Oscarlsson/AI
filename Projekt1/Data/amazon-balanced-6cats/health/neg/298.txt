I really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that I'm not too happy about.  The filter doesn't "lock" down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out, the filter plops out of the top, causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher.  It's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it's worth.  The other Brita pitcher I have, the filter locks into place and doesn't do this.
