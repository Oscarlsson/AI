I purchased this table from another vendor--the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off.  It also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support.  The table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top.  I promptly returned this table
