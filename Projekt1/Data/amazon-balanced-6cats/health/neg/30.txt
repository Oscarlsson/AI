Read some reviews that say "my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day," and ask yourself - wouldn't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much TAP WATER and walking a mile a day?!

This water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value. If you won't drink water and exercise unless you have "special" water imbued with mythical powers, than by all means, this is the product for you. But if you prefer to save your money, simply exercise, eat healthier, and drink regular tap water
