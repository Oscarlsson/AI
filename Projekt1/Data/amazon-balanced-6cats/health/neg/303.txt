All Sleep MD is, is Melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in. You can get Melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost. Melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid, but you don't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it! Sleep MD is a total rip off
