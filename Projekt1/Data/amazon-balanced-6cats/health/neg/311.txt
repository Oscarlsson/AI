Unfortunately, my experience was completely different. Starting with the unprofessional shipping. Shaver and components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers instead of professional packing material. Shaver and Trimmer are almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page!! I felt mislead by the pictures. Another person said how impressive the shaver is. I had the exact opposite experience. I picked it up and I was more than underwhelmed. The shaver is about the size of a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight, not the motor. Not to be mean, but the shaver reminds me of something I might pickup in a 99 cents store. The other day I found a far better shaver from Remington for about $8 in my local Raley's store. Of course, to find out about this Seiko shaver first hand you'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item, because Donner charges a 35% sanitary disposal fee if you open the item. On top of that the shipping charges are also non-refundable. On the other hand, if I return the $8 grocery store shaver to the store, I'd get a full refund, if I'm not happy with the product. Ok, so how well does it shave? Not bad, but also not any better than the $8 shaver from my grocery store. The blade component seems extremely flimsy (essentially 3 tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic) and if you do decide to use this shaver, you'll be ordering replacement blades in no time. All in all, I was not happy with my purchase in the least. $60 spent on something that should be around $10
