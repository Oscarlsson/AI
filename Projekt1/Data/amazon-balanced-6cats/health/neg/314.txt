Upon purchasing this product, I'd hoped it would be equivilant to the product I normally purchase at the salon.  I was horribly disappointed.  It was nothing at all like the typical product, rather much more like water.  The normal scent was not present, the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long.  I would very much like to return this.  It's not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon.  I was sorely disappointed
