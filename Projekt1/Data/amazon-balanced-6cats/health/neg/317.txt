I bought the Duro-Med 7921LCST-BG because of a back injury--I need good back support in order to sit somewhat comfortably.

This product is very disappointing.  The material with which it is filled is of such a low density that it gives practically no support at all.

If you need firm back support, I would look elsewhere (I don't know of a good source yet).    If you don't need such support, then I don't know why you'd have any interest in this product--but I suppose there could be valid reasons that I can't imagine
