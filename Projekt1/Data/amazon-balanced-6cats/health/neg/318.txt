Though not advertised to humidify a large room, I found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room.  I tested it, in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room, by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room, and after 2 hours not even a 1% increase in humidity!
Fortunately, I was able to receive a full refund
