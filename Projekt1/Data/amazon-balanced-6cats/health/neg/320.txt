I am a male.  I did a search and this item showed up for men.  However, it is way too long for a man unless he is Yao Ming.  It looked like I was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees.  I am 5'10" tall.

Also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback.  It clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity.  

I will not ever buy another product made of this material
