I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.  

The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.  

The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn't been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail.
