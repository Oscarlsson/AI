First, know this, it is a trimmer not a shaver!  With the included height attachment, your bound to have a little fuzz still left.  Without the attachment, you get closer results, but still very visible hair lines.  I am quite disapointed with the product, because it runs on two AAA batteries, the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles.  This lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you.  I would certainly not recommend this product, but might be necessary if you'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild.
