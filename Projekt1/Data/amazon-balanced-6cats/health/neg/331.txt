The self cleaning concept was the reason I bought this razor. The razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad. After owning the razor for two months I noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after I had just refilled the fluid. After a closer inspection I found out that the fluid had leaked out all over, and this fluid destroys everything it touches that isn't metal or plastic. I thought maybe I had done something to cause the problem so I refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process. Immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together. It is now headed to the landfill. The trimmer does not work well either
