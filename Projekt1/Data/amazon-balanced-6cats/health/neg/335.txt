My Braun thermoscan has given me nothing but trouble.
Yes this ear thermometer is easy to use.  You just have to stick it into the canal correctly.  Not hard.  What I don't like is you can stick it in the same ear, the same way, 6 different times and get very different readings.
Everytime I have gone to use my thermometer, the battery would be dead.  You have to use the special medical circular batteries, so of course I would never have any handy.  Then I got smart and started stocking up on the batteries.  They are expensive.  And everytime I would use it I'd have to put in a fresh new battery.
This also needs the disposable ear covers in order for it to work.  Yes there is a trick to getting around it but then your thermometer isn't sanitary.  Finding the covers was sometimes easy and sometimes impossible.
I have just never been happy with it.  Yes it's easier than the oral... But I found one even better.  Try the Temporal Artery Thermometer.  You can use that one on a sleeping child
