Don't bother with these.  I am a school nurse, and not just this brand, but MOST brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent, especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal.  I had to use the ear type for 8 years between Pediatric ICU and school nursing.  I got pretty good at getting consistent readings, except on very small ear canals, and those with a lot of wax.  We got rid of ours and went with an Exergen TemporalScanner Temporal Artery Thermometer.  It takes less time, doesn't require probes, and you can get one at Costco for $30
