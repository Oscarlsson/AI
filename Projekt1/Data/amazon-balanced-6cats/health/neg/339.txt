I was excited to try these because I liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together.  I am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers.  And since I like the other Huggies styles, I was very enthused.  Until I went through 5 diapers, everyone of which leaked.  Leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a BM came out the legs, I gave up.  I tried everything possible to make these work, but they leak.  Maybe in the smaller sizes, but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did NOT work.  Also, my son is in 50% percentile for height and weight, so skinny legs were not the problem.
