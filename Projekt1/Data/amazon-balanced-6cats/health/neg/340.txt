After many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers, I decided to give Huggies another try because I have a very active toddler, and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable. Unfortunately, this comfort comes at the expense of utility. My daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack, when I saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back. Just like the smaller sizes, this version does not hold anything in!!!
