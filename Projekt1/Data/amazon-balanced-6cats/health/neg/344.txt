After a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine, I purchased this scale. On the unit I received, the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs. 

The scale I was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit. I have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone. I wanted to see if I was having an impact on body fat so I purchased this scale. 

When I attempt to use this scale, it errors out with the OL code. Perhaps the magazine should retract another article
