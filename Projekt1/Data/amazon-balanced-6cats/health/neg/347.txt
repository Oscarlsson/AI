I recently purchased the Obus Forme Lowback Backrest, along with the Seat Cushion. Although I have heard people rave about the excellent support, and they felt comfortable enough to me, I can't give them more than 2 stars. The material used in their construction drove me to distraction. This is obviously a personal preference type of thing. Other folks may have no issues with the material at all. These are just my feelings on the matter:

I found the texture of the fabric to be a little rough and it didn't allow easy movement when sitting on/leaning against it, which would drive me crazy after just a few hours at work. Also, when making any movements, the compression of the foam, and the friction between it and the fabric covering, made really annoying noises. It reminded me somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it. The Backrest was even worse than the Seat Cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping (looked sort of like shrink wrap or Saran wrap) around the foam inside, which made loud crinkling noises every time I even twitched. It was awful! However good the science behind the backrest and cushion is, the sound effects and unpleasant texture were distracting enough, to me at least, to return both items.
