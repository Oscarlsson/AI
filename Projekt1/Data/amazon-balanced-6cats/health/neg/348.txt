I have a Honeywell humidifier that is on my personal top 10 "must have" items.  I figure with these cartridges the performance could only improve.  I was wrong.  There is NO improvement in the cleanliness of the tank or the filter area.  The water actually smells funny with the cartridge in.  Plus, I have noticed that the little beads inside fall out, and are reported to be harmful to pets and animals.  They're so little it's hard to see them.  Not a huge deal to me, but I'm sure it could pose a problem to someone.  

All in all, I would rather purchase purified water, or get a water filter for my sink for the water to use in the humidifier than use these, since there is no real difference.
