The description for this cartridge says that it "provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria" with its "Aquastat" antimicrobial technology.  If you read the literature that comes with it, however, it says that it prevents microbe growth *in the cartridge*.  Not in your humidifier.  It's not an antimicrobial cartridge; it's a demineralization cartridge.  Whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it
