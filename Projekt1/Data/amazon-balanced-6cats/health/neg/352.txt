...and it wasn't worth having to send it back.  Seriously.  I thought maybe it was the batteries, so I switched them.  No luck. It ran very, very slow, and then it just quit.  As another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use, it's my guess that something melted/warped in the mechanism.  I will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time I was able to use it, so I'll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash.  I have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it, so I know all their merchandise isn't shoddy.  Maybe I got a dud, considering many others' positive reviews.  I sure hope so
