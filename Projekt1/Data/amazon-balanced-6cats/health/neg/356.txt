I bought one and it worked great. At first it's hard to manuever because it's really hot, and the barrel's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot, but once you get used to it, it does a stellar job of straightening your hair. Around 6 months into using the straightner, the machine slowly overheated and died. Thinking I had a faulty model, I went out and bought a new one. Guess what ? A few months into THAT one, it ended the same way.

So basically, not worth it.
