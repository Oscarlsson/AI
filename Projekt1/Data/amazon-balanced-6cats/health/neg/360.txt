I purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep. Well folks this is not what happened at all. I turned on my Conair SU1W and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day. About 5 minutes into my relaxation I almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck. The volume which seemed to have been controlled by Satan reached top volume, although I never had touched it myself. I tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring. I unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times, and still it would not work
