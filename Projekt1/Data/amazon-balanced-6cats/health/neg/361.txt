I really dun know if i was expecting too much out of this machine...but its not really that great...there are just one or two sounds that u may like..like the running stream,heartbeat, tropical forest etc..the rest of them like the ocean waves, rainfall...thunderstorm...white noice...etc pretty much dont let u sleep...Also someone complained here about the alarm...What Alarm????? thats a different model which is about $20...this one  is just the sounds....which sound artificial...if u are expecting a more natural sound...move on...this one is more like a radio with too much static!
