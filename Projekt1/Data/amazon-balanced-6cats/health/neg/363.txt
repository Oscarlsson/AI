I personally have not taken this diet pill; however I am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt "trippy" "weird" and "out of sorts". Britney Spears had been taking this stuff for a while...then as we all know she went all "postal", shaved her head, attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and didn't return.....and we wonder why she did it...hummmm... None the less, the side effects like those reported I've seen personally from close friends. They should re-name this diet pill Asylum-X, because that's where you'll be. Diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids, and I don't know about you but I'm not comfortable with something altering my state of being....just something for you to "swallow"
