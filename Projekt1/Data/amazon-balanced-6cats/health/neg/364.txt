I bought this product after having taken Diet Fuel w/ ephedra several years ago. I needed energy this time and to lose a few extra baby pounds.  Within minutes of taking my FIRST and ONLY pill I had a horrible reaction.  I broke out in WELTS within 10 minutes all over my body. I was shaky and sick to my stomach.  I drank 5 glasses of milk to neutralize it and finally started to feel better. I thought I was going to die.  My only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never seeing my kids again. After about 2 hours the welts disappeared but I felt horrible for the rest of the day.  Obviously there is something in it that doesn't get along with my body but after that reaction I had I have decided that no diet pill is worth the chance of what can happen to you.
