And I am not just talking about weight loss products.  I took one pill....ONE PILL!  Within a few minutes, I was curled up around the toilet crying because I needed to throw up so badly but I couldn't.  I hadn't drunk anything but one glass of water with it, and yet, I was peeing all day.  I was nauseus....my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me.  I didn't want to move, but I would have to go to the bathroom to pee, and would carry around a trash can with me just in case I finally could throw up.  I would not wish these symptoms on ANYONE, not even my worst enemy.  That was probably the worst sickness I have ever had
