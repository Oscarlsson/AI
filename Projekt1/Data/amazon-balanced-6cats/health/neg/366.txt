I have found another product that I want to recommend. It's called Alert and is sold by consultants like Avon, but you can also go the Starlight website and order it. It's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters, and as a bonus I don't feel hungry when I'm using it. They also have a product specifically for weight loss. I have tried that as well. I did feel a bit jittery at first... but it settled after a week or so of taking it. I would recommend it also. I used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs. I did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss, but I credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings.
I'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what I need ... energy and hunger control and it's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so I now use it. I've used this for years and have not had any problems.
