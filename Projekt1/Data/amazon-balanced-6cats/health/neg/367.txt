I bought two of these pieces of junk, and believe me they do NOT work unless your room is about 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet. 

IT RECIRCULATES THE SAME AIR OVER AND OVER IN A TINY AREA!

When they say it cleans 700 cubic feet per hour, that is simply what the fan can MOVE per hour not what it actually will clean in a 10 foot by 10 foot by 7 foot room.


The fan is so weak at full speed you can barely feel it. Really it is sucking in air through the bottom and blowing it out at the top. Both the inlet and outlet are facing the same side so you are basically recirculating most of the same air over and over again. This thing would need to be 7 feet tall to really work well. 

In a hospital they have HUGE systems that MOVE the air past LARGER ARRAYS of bulbs.

So here you are sitting in a room with your kids coughing on one side and this thing recirculating the same air over and over again, in a little tiny airspace, what a great deal. Just be ready to buy 10 of them per room.

Maybe you can try hanging 5 on the celiing and putting 5 on the floor of a  4' x5' bathroom and it might work in a week.

Do yourself a favor, and buy a machine that has more UV light bulbs, and has a greater airflow so ALL the air in a room is moving and ALL of the air in the room goes through the filter.


I gave it a one because it looks nifty.
