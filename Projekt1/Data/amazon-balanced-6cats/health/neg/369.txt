You were kind enough to replace my first order of these razors due to the fact that one never worked and the other wore out quickly.  The second pair seems to be pretty much the same.  One sputs and spurts and the other works only when I shake and tap it several times.  I used to own another brand of these razors that were great, but I can't recall the name, unfortunately.  I am very disappointed in the product, but I'm very satisfied with Amazon and the way in which they are trying to please me every way they can
