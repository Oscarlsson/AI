     Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings. 

     Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.  

     In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result.

     As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security.

     If you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting, please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.
