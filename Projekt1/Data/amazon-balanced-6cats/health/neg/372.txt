I expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called &quot;batteries.&quot;  Number one, I was disappointed to find out, after some scientific analyses I performed on them, that duracell's world famous  &quot;copper top&quot; statement is erroneous. This so called &quot;copper  top&quot; is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called  copposyclamatrane. I can't top the copper top? hardly.     After the  analyses, I put these &quot;copper top&quot; batteries to the test.  What I  did was I stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like  sheen.  What I got was far from.  A tiny light that could only be  classified as much less than miniscule.  I threw the flashlight at my cat  in disgust, expecting hilarious results, and I wasn't disapointed!  This  was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision I've  ever made.  Thanks for nothing, dura-hell
