Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare' bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite poorly. 

The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries) on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution.

Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth--

Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see
