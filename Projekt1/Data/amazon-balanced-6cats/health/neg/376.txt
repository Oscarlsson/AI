I had an old Sonicare (rechargable) for about a year and a half. I dropped it and it stopped working. (My fault.) Not willing to pay ~$[...] for another rechargable one, I thought I would give the e3000 a try. 

I then bought my first e3000 in August for 2006. It mysteriously stopped working around December of 2006. (I didn't drop it this time.) I bought a second one. It also mysteriously stopped working in March of 2007. (Again, I didn't drop it or harm the toothbrush in any way!) 2 Dead Toothbrushes in 8 months! 

I'm not sure if I should buy another e3000 or if I should give up on the Sonicare brand completely.
