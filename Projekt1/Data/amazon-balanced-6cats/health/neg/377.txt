The good:  the massage function works fine, no problems with the performance, and the battery holds a good charge.

The bad:  how much money is saved in construction by using the 
cheapest foam padding imaginable? 

The ugly: the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months.  Maybe a cheaper material could have been found...but I doubt it.

Overall good in theory, but very poor in execution.  If some real quality were put into the product, it would rate potentially 5 stars.  'Til then,you've been warned....
