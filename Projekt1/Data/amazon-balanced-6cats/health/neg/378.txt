I've had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well.  I've worn out 3 Norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase I thought.  This razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it.  I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face.  I'm going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift
