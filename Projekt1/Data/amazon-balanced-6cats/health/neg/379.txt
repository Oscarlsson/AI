I bought this product based on the great reviews on amazon.  I had one of the original epiladies from the eighties, and was expecting some kind of miraculous new design that would be pain-free and effective.  Well, I guess you can't have both.  It's very comfortable to use but completely ineffective.  It takes forever to clear each section of hair, and the hair that is taken off breaks off just above the surface.  So the result is skin as stubbly as a three day old shaving job.  I guess it's back to the good old razor for me
