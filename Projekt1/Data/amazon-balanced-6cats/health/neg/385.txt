We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age. It's harder to fill than the AVIVA and not as pretty, but so what -- it works, and the AVIVA doesn't.
