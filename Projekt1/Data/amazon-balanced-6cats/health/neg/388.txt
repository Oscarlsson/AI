I bought this for my lower back. I am pregnant now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to time. It is great because it actually wraps all the way around to the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without having to switch it from one side to the other. 

However, the inner pad bunches up tremendously. I have used it for a few weeks now, and have to take the cover off to "open" the pad back up by stretching it out again. It hasn't gone back to the original shape. If I had known it would do this, I would have never purchased it.
