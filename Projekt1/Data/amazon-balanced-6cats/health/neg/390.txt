This heating pad was received as a gift to replace the Sunbeam heating pad I had used for 35 years and had finally worn out. I was delighted with the larger size, but the new pad did not heat at all. I returned it to HoMedics (along with the $5 handling charge), and two months later they sent a replacement. The replacement heats up, but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted. It almost looks like it has melted to itself, and it can't be flattened out. I won't be sending this one back with another $5 handling charge--it isn't worth it. This one goes out with the trash, and I go back to Sunbeam.
