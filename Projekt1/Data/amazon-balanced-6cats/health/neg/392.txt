I liked this heating pad so much when I first used it that I immediately ordered a second one (for what I expected would be a year or two in the future). What I liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads, allowing it to conform to the shape of my body. However, the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat. I returned it to HomeMedics and they ignored me. The second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat. I will not bother wasting the postage to return this one, as obviously HomeMedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction. I recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product
