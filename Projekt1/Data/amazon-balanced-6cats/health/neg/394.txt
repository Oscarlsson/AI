I bought two boxes of these Luv diapers (thats 448 diapers!) and I sure wish I had spent a little extra for Pampers Swaddlers.  These diapers leak out the top because they don't have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist.  Even the generic Kroger diapers have elastic waistbands!  I am just sad that I have to use these crappy diapers for so long! I also think they run small so I probably will not even use them all. What a waste!  The only good thing about these diapers is the price, but, I would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue.  P.S. I don't like Huggies either because they leak out the legs! Hard to find a good diaper
