I purchsed a package of these because the supermarket was out of my regular diapers and my baby is only two months and we've been trying different diapers. I was instantly disgusted by the scent when I opened the package; the diapers are scented and it doesn't say so on the package. I would never have bought them if I'd known that. 
The worked fine for leaks and those related worries, but every time I put one on her I was irritated. I want to smell my baby, pooh incidend or not, when I pick her up. I don't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers. Shes my child, she smells, its ok
