The plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner. I was not in the same state when the package arrived so I was not able to open it for over a month...my loss. I don't know if it was not structurally sound, or if the box was just not handled properly.  Either way, I've got a dud
