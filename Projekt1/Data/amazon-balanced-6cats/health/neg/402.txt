Just used this razor for the first time.  Could not get a close shave out of it at all.  The trimmer will cut hair but not stubble.  On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  I'm very disappointed in this razor but I guess I got what I paid for.  I'm going to order a new razor right now because I can't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary
