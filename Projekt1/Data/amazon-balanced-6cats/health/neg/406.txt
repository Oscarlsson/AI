I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars).  It just doesn't work very well...I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort).  The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly.  The box says it can run for 45 minutes on two AA's, but after about 5 minutes...you can feel it slow down.  

Definitely not worth it.  I'm calling today to return it.
