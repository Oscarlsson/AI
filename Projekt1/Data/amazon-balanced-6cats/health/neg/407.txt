I really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is. Not. The motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working. You wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again. But by the time you are  getting results in one area of your foot, the thing heats up and stops working again. I went through four intervals of effective operation, heat build-up causing it to quit, waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again. Finally I decided it isn't worth the time and aggravation, even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked. One more thing -- when I gave up and decided to return it, I took my Duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot. I worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor. I've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this.
UPDATE: Found Something Much Better
After returninng the Artemis, I tried the Medicool PediSenso professional pedicure appliance. This one costs 5 times the price of the Artemis but is SOOOO much better it is well worth it. The Medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated Artemis. It has variable speeds, 5 different sapphire filing attachments, and enough power to operate as long as you need. The sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime, whereas the Artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries. So over time the costs of owning the Artemis will add up -- if the overly hot motor does not burn out. If you have serious callouses and corns, like I do, the Medicool PediSenso will do a very serious, rewarding job. I'm so glad I found it and I am grateful for the relief it provides
