I tried this product because I had been using Arthred-G powder which was discontinued.  This product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that I could not finish drinking it.
It tasted and smelled rather like soap.
If you used Arthred-G you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage.  There is no comparison here!!!  I would totally avoid this product
