I like how quickly the rollers heat - a vast improvement over waiting at least half an hour.  However, like the other reviewer said - I absolutely hate the clips.  They are all one size, so they are too large for the smallest rollers.  I also don't like them because they don't keep the roller still like the "U" shaped clips did, and they leave a dent impression in my hair.  I don't recommend them primarily because of the clip system
