I've tried this razor for 5 weeks, both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that I've ever used. It doesn't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble. I should
have bought a new Norelco instead of this. My old Norelco always
shaved me close. This Panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor, or to be used in a pinch. But for a close shaving everyday razor, this isn't the one to buy. 
Oh well, I waited too long to send it back
