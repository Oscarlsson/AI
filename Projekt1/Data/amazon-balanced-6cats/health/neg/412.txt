I bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - So I thought one of them might actually be hot.  Instead, the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot.  This may be a "lawsuit friendly" reality with heating pads today - I've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago (I had that one for 10+ years, the Sunbeam replacement I bought prior to this one lasted 2 and wasn't hot).
