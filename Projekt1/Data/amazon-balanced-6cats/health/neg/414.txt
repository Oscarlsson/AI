I couldn't send this item back quickly enough.  I presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot massagers, that it would be an effective, high quality item. NEVER PRESUME!  

With a low powered hair dryer mounted in the middle, it sounds like a small aircract while the base vibrates uncontrolably.  I'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet.  

I'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the reviewers I've read seem to have.  This is just an unusable product.  The materials look cheaper in person, it offers virtually no "massage" to the foot, and it is incredibly loud.  There is no redeeming quality to this item.  

Before I bought it, I looked all over the web for a review, unable to find one.  Hopefully I can save someone else the disappointment.  Did I mention I hated it
