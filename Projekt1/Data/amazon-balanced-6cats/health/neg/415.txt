I've had this for about a month, and I've used it less than 6 times.
Even though I've carefully handwashed it, and merely wiped off the ice ring, the ice ring has sprung a leak (ewww, blue liquid on my celery!!).
The lid is difficult to snap on/remove.
The center container/lid is really too tall for its diameter, which makes using it for dipping rather awkward
