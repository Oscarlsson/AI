Though the description of this product says it's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice, mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat. I used them once and then packed them away because I do not like the odor. I wish the mitts had been unscented. Perhaps over time, or by next winter, the odor will be gone and I'll get some use out of them
