I just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one I had for years. I read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices, price being the primary concern. The saying you get what you paid for is true !! The heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap. Pay more and be happier
