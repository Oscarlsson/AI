I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.

I've read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it's my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon
