I had bought this heating pad previously for an elderly cat because it did not have automatic shut-off and it works wonderfully. I just bought another one for our sickly kitten and they have added an automatic shut-off valve that they do not mention in the product description! I wanted a heating pad without automatic shut-off! I can get a heating pad with an automatic shut-off anywhere
