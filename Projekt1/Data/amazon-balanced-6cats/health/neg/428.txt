This thing is a cheap piece of plastic, and for the same price you can get the larger, nice rock fountain that i have owned and know for a fact works well. I can hardly hear the sound of the rain over the whirring of the motor. It has a nice design in terms of look and it's compact. I also enjoy the lights for ambiance. But for relaxation, this thing has brought me more grief in 3 days than it's worth
