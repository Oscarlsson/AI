These 'cartridges' sell for about $2 a piece, plus shipping. I recently switched from the Mach 3 Turbo to a Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor and I can safely say I will never go back. The Mach 3 provides a decent enough shave (much better than an electric, in my experience) but the single blade is actually much smoother. I pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the Mach 3 at $1.50-$2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days
