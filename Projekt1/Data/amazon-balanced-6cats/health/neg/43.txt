It never ceases to amaze me how often Gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it's loyal clientele.
 
The Fusion is a classic example, from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a Sensor Excel.

Don't buy into the hype, the Fusion is an expensive joke of a product.
