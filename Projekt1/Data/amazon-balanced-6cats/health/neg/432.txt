Looked like a good product with a good price. Unit failed to turn on or ever  take a charge despite plugging in properly and trying to charge overnight as suggested in the instructions. Now I have to go and deal with returning it to Amazon, shipping it back, getting another one, etc. Am willing to change my review upon receipt/use of a new unit but definitely not giving a five since now I have to go through this trouble
