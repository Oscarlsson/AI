The shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible. This razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary. But using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin. This razor does not poduce a light lather, it is more like a slime that drips from it. I did not notice a tropical scent
