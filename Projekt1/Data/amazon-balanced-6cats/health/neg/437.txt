I got the Fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so I decided to give it a try.  At first it seemed ok, but I started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my Mach 3 turbo.  I decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a Mach 3 Turbo and the other half with the Fusion.  From my experience, the Mach 3 Turbo gave a closer shave, and glided much smoother across my skin than the Fusion.  I think the 5 blades on the Fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else.  And as cool as the single trimming blade is, it seems like Gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades.  In other words, the single blade is a fix rather than a feature.  My call is if your using a Mach 3 Turbo, don't waste your money on the Fusion
