Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades.  This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors.  The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face.  The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves, and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face.
