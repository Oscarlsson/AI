I recently purchased this model to replace an older Panasonic model that I loved for years. This new model ER430K is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement. It's nice and quiet, and I'm sure the vacuum works great, but I wouldn't know since the blades would not cut the hairs I was trying to trim. We're talking about hairs easily 1/4" in length. A trimmer should be able to shave those down, don't you think? If the hair was longer than that I could have used scissors. Don't bother even trying this product, it's a waste of money
