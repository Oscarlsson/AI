My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else
