I have very thick, very coarse, wavy hair. When my two year old CHI straightening iron broke, I needed to replace it quickly!  Locally the only iron I could find was the T3 Tourmaline iron, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It cost more than the CHI, was sold at a fancy salon, and could even be used on damp hair.  Surely it would be a good replacement.

Unfortunately, it failed to impress. 

-It did not leave my hair silky smooth.  While my hair was certainly straighter, it still looked coarse.  (This was on the hottest setting and with several passes over the hair)

-Because my hair is so thick, an iron needs to reduce the volume.  The T3 failed in this respect, too.  

-I thought I would like the larger (almost 2") iron surface.  The T3 has a perfectly flat surface, which made it impossible to get a flip or curl on the ends. 

Needless to say, I returned it quickly to the pricey salon and will be getting another CHI!  Perhaps this brand would work better for someone with fine hair, since the temperature can be adjusted
