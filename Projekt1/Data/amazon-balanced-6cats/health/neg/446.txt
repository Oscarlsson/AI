Do not buy this iron.  It's fabulous while it works, for which it does merit the one star.  But it broke in less than a week.  It overheated, or something, and then wouldn't turn on again.  But here's the kicker: if you buy it from Amazon, the company won't honor the warranty.  

I don't have particularly heavy-duty hair.  This is just totally unacceptable.
