I had another Norelco shaver for the last 5 (or more) years.  The difference in the shaves is striking.  Both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer.

However, the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2.  I know this because I took it in to be "repaired" because I only got 8 shaves to a charge.  I talked (online) with Norelco and they said my shaver was broken.  So, I looked up on the Norelco site a local authorized repair shop.  I took it in and the guy opened it up.  He said it was one of the "cheap" versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries.

My old shaver, over most of its life, gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged.  That's quite a difference
