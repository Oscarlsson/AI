I've been taking these for over 3 weeks.. I have not seen any new hair growth.  I think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster.  I would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from GNC or any other place you can find them.  They are much less expensive
