I got this as a gift for my husband.  He used it for about 3 weeks, but still had red marks, and had to follow up afterwards with a regular "disposable" razor.  The whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and wasn't as good.

Luckily, Braun had a 30 day money-back guarantee, so we were able to return it (minus shipping x 2)
