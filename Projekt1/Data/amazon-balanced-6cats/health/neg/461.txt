i had ordered this item expecting good things from it. however, the article has never worked properly. the electrical system seems to be working fine, but the uv light has never come on. somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize. right now the product is only a toothbrush holder; nothing more. i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder. i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it. in short, i won't buy anything like this again
