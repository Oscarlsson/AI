I agree with other reviewers that it feels good and doesn't smell too much, however, I've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings, and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads.  I'm 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin. On mornings after using this cream, I have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin.
