I have been using Cross product for lat 15 years. This product which is Made in China, has highly disappointed me. The finish of the pen is very poor. Gold plating is  of a poor quality. It has some patches of a different color. The body has sharp edges.
Overall it has spoilt my impression about Cross products.
