I was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad, since I just returned mine after one use.  Perhaps the one I got was defective, but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and wasn't hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle.  

I also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area, and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear.  The placement of the strap doesn't allow the pad to conform to the body, but only to press against it where the strap runs through - just the center, not the rest of the pad.

I realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm, but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly.  

For the time being I'll keep wearing Thermacare(TM)  back wraps (which are expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now) but do last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat. Also, this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where I need it.

If you need intense heat for a sore back, I'd skip this heating pad
