Thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush, but no. My hair is long-ish and kind of fine/straight. The brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush. So, I couldn't get the  full volume results I wanted. I can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better. It is very loud though. I returned mine
