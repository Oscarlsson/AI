     I'm not sure how reliable these types of thermometers are so I don't know whether to say this one or these types are not very reliable.  Either way it is really hard to get a correct temperature or to know if you have gotten a correct temperature with this thermometer.  I follow the instructions and have to repeat them over and over before I get a consistent reading.  I threw mine away
