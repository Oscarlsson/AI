This is the most innacurate thermometer I have ever come across.  Each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more.  Moreover, the battery only lasts for 1-2 uses.  Granted, one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature, but you would think the battery could last a few more times.  When you have a sick child, accuracy and time are of the essence
