I would give it negative stars but that wasn't an option. This thing is horrible...doesn't cut very close, certainly doesn't hold a charge, engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes. And oh yeah...the horrible razor burn!!! Seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams
