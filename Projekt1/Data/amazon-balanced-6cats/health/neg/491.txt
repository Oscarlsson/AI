I complete disagree with the previous review on that Sonicare is superior.  I've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and Braun Sonic Complete is by far the best.  However, this unit is NOTHING like Sonic Complete, the sonic energy is completely in the handle, it's like holder a vibrator.  The real Sonic Complete channels the energy to the brush head...  You are probably better more with one of the other two models of Vitality that uses rotational brush heads
