Pull ups are NOT very good for potty training, they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom.  Potty training does not include using diapers.  That is what these are is fancy diapers.  If you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them.  The wetness liner is a joke.  These also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants
