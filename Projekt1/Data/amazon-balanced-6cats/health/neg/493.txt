When I gave birth I had already bought packages of newborn huggies. They were horrible. I thought once my boys got older that maybe huggies would work then. NOPE. I've tried Huggies Supreme and the cheap huggies. They are both made horribly and after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them. I thought since everyone always talks about pull-ups that they would work once potty training time came around. WRONG AGAIN. They leaked evertime he wore them. Do not waste you money. I always ended up going back to the pampers swaddlers, cruisers, and training pants. Pampers are the best.
