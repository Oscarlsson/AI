The topmost review described these batteries as "AA in a D package," which is entirely correct.  What certain loser battery brands like Energizer do is put a AA battery in a D-sized sleeve, thereby hoodwinking unwary consumers into purchasing an inferior product that holds a much smaller (approx 2500 mAh) charge than a "normal" D cell (9000+ mAh.)  Fortunately, these bogus D cells are easy to spot if the manufacturer prints the maximum charge on the packaging--that is, 2000-2500 mAh, which is AA cell territory.  Additionally, the fakes are much lighter than the genuine article--inside is mostly air.  Too bad I mistakenly bought a package of these.  I'll have to settle for consoling myself by boycotting Energizer for the rest of time.
