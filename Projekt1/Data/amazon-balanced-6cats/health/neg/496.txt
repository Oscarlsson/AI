Top of the line (April 2005) D-cell NiMH batteries have 11,000 mAh compared to this one 2,200 mAh (they cost 16 bucks but 10,000 mAh battery costs six bucks). Top of the line AA NiMH batteries have capacity of 2500 mAh. Top of the line NiCad D-Cell batteries have 5000 mAh capacity (costs around five bucks). I thought that NiMH was more capable than NiCad. True, but not in this case.

So what are we gettting here? Higher AA battery capacity in D-cell case. This battery is overpriced for what it delivers.
