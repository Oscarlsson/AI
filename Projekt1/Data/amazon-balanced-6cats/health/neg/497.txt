I bought 8 size D's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips.  Wrong answer.  I was able to play 2 1/2 CDs before my box was out of juice.  Game over.  I realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around, but these batteries were fresh off the charger when I left.  I figured they'd at least last into the night, but they were finished before sundown.  Don't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices...  I got fooled.  Fool me once, shame on you.  We can't get fooled again
