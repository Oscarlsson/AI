I travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and I needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers, so after some research I decided to purchase the travel-size T3. 

During the first time I used it, it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire. (There were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out)

I took the dryer back to Sephora and I was quickly given a replacement.

While I had dryer #2, I noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair, when it usually takes 20-30. However, I have the full size T3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when I use that one.  I was expecting this to offer the same power as the other T3.  The bottom line is that I didn't notice a big difference between the travel T3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms. 

After 6 months, the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use. 

If you want a great hairdryer, buy a full size T3, Elchim or Chi Pro -- if you need something to travel with, you're better off with finding space for the full size model.
