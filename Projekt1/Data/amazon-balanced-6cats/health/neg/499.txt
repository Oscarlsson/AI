I bought this scale because I figured the price was right.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.

First of all, it is flimsy in construction.  I am under 200 lbs., yet when I step on it, the cheap plastic bends down.  You can just feel how thin and unsubstantial the plastic is.

Next, the first time I weighed myself, I found that I had lost 7 lbs. overnight!  If only this were true.  I didn't believe it.  I stepped off and got back on and I had gained back 5 of the lost pounds.  Off and on again -- and I was up another 4.

If you like to just kind of average your many readings, then this scale will work for you.  Otherwise, take a pass.

BTW, and I was using it on a flat hard surface.
