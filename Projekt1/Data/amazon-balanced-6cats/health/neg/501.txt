We already owned a different HoMedics sound machine and it's far better than this one.  The volume control doesn't work well at all on this machine; either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static, no matter where we used the machine.  The product seemed very flimsy as well.  We ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine
