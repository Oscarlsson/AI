My one star rating is for Amazon's service, not the WaterPik attachment, which I never received.  Despite the fact that I ordered this on 20 February 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days (and is still stated to be 7-9 days), TWO weeks later Amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 April 2007.  I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days.

In my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised.  I don't understand why Amazon can't keep better track of their inventory
