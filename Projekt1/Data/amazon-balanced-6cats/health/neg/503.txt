I purchased the Waterpik NA-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment, expecting it to work with the Waterpik Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet, since that is what was advertised. THEY DON'T FIT IN THIS MODEL, SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PURCHASING BOTH TOGETHER! The sinus attachments are too short, so they can't "click" into the water pik. The end result: Water leaks out, and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment. I had to return both items since the Amazon rep couldn't find any sinus attachment to work in the Waterpik Ultra model. It's a shame because I love the small footprint of the Waterpik Ultra, and it comes with a lot of cool attachments. Hopefully Waterpik will come up with something in the near future
