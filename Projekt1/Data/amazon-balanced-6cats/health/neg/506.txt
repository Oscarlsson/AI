I owned this set for about 2 and a half years before I finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers (I used it about 4-5 times per year). First off, the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place, it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head. Second, the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair. Third, the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use. I would roll up my hair (which would take like, 30 minutes because of the difficulty), and if I walked around the house to watch TV while I waited for my hair to set, the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room. I eventually lost like 6 clips from the "springing out" thing. 

The results of these rollers were great, though. I used them on my wedding  day and people loved it. Good results, but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers
