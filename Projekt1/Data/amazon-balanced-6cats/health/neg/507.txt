I purchased two Aquis Microfiber, Waffle, White (19 x 39 inches) Towels.  Although
they are quite expensive, the positive reviews made them sound great.  Well, they
are not.  The towels are quite thin, and do not rub/slide well on the skin.   They give
the feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up when
you rub your skin.
They are the same thickness as a dish towel, so we are using them to blot the dishes
when they come out of the dishwasher.
Save your money on this one!
