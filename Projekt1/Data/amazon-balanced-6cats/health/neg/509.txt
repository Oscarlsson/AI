I've only used the unit 3 times, and the flip-over trimmer broke when I "flipped" it over to attach to the main clipper head. The plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head, that cracked in two, and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor. It's very disappointing. I'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer, I can't seem to find the receipt
