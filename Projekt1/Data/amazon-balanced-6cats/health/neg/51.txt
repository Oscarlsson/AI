My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me.  I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week.  After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in.  The FM radio worked only once - I thought I had a short in the headset.  Good idea but really did not perform/last for the money
