This review covers the FB11NR: same unit with slightly different control pushbuttons and with an IR remote.

Somehow, i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning massagers under each foot were powered. Nope... basically just built-in plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging rollers that one rolls one's foot upon. That's fine, yet when i want to relax, i'm not thinking about moving my feet. Fortunately, those are removable, and removal is exactly what happened.

The killer was that the center massage wheel, which IS supposed to be powered and IS supposed to spin, was D.O.A. This unit went back to the store, and we bought an FB21 instead. Amazon has no listing for that model, so i can't give a full review on it. It was good enough to keep.

Both the FB11NR and the FB21 share some traits. Neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature. Sound levels vary from fairly quiet to quite loud, depending upon the operating mode chosen (i did dB measurements on the FB21, but since Amazon doesn't list that one, you don't get to see them). The FB21 seems to have slightly better build quality, and everything worked out of the box, so we kept that one
