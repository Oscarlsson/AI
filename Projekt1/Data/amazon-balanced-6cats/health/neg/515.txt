A fine example of how fickle or intimate (I prefer the word intimate) scent is to each of us. This is one fragrance that I have not gotten to like. Received as a gift more than a year ago, the bottle still has three-quarters. It does have a `rich' scent but I find it to be too confusing and indescribable a scent, not educing a one word description like `sporty', `sexy', `alluring'. I don't wear it very often but I don't recall a single occasion of `what fragrance are you wearing?' with this one. It's just not my cup of tea so definitely, if you're not familiar with this scent beforehand; do not buy before trying it out at a department store for a day. Why Buy? As a gift for the guy competing for the female that is currently in your crosshairs. As a gift for your boss - you will know he's coming from a mile away. You need a gift for a guy who couldn't pour water out of a boot even if there were instructions on the hee
