I bought this product in Rite Aid. 
Unfortunately, it irriates my face. 
They are scamming people just to buy this product. 
Instead of repairing my face, this product damage my face.
There are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since I start using this. 
Now, I need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product. 
If I knew this will happen, I will not waste my money to buy this product.
