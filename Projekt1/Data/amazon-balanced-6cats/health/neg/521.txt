We bought this at suggestion of our dentist.  However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press.  We used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience.

Our neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave.

Save your money and go back to flossing!
