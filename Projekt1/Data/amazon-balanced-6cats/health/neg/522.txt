I had to return my recent purchase due to a defect.  I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many, many years and typically have to replace every two or three years.  I was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet.  I purchased the WaterPik Ultra, and I am pleased with the design, size and operation thus far.  I just hope WaterPik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service
