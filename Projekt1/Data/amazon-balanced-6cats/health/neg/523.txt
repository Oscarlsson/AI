I purchased this dryer because of the shape and attachments and wanted to try an ionic dryer. First of all, if this is an ionic dryer I was better off with my super cheap dryer. Second, the back seam of the dryer melted!! Several people have mentioned that it overheats and they are not lying. It shuts off and refuses to come back on. Which is good because then it might melt completely. Don't waste your money on this
