This dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could.  THe problem is that it just shuts off.  The first time I used it, it shut off twice within a 20-minute period.  It wouldn't restart when I plugged it back in, or even when I tried a different outlet.  No matter what I tried, it wouldn't restart for about 5 minutes.  I've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product
