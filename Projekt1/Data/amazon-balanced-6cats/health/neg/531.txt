This is a cheap plastic (except for the metal tube)toy. It's like those hand claws for kids. You squeeze the handle and the claw closes. The grabber part on this thing has a 2 1/2" opening. You won't be able to grab a small can of soup. The magnet is weak and is located on the outside of one of the grabber finger. On the inside of the fingers, they have rubber pads that are removable (probably for cleaning) but they seem to come off on their own
