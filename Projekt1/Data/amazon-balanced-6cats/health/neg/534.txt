I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so I bough one box at Walmart. It's not worth it, that's my conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like material, and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started to feel a vague pain in my gum.  Nevertheless, I continued using the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is barely visible. I hope you will have better luck.
