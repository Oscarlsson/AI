After user #1 I was REALLY impressed.  My teeth were noticeably whiter--almost gleaming.  After use number two I noticed a bit more whitening but not as dramatic.  On use # 3 I felt some discomfort after putting the trays in.  After about 1/2 hour it was really starting to hurt and I thought something must be wrong so I took them out.  My gums were bleached white!

I was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1/2 an hour.  However, there was some lingering damage done that, while not severe, is annoying (there is still a slight bit of bleeding).  I have perfectly healthy gums so I was surprised by this...the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums.

My advice, if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out
