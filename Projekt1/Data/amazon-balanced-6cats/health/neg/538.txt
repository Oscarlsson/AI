For the price you cant beat this product, IF the problem I'm experiencing can be solved. 
I bought two of these brushes, one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag. Love the price and timer feature... 
But it seems that once I've used up the power in the brush, it wont recharge properly. I'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long I leave it in the charger.
If there is a simple fix for this then I'd say 5 stars. If not, then 2 Stars is well earned, seeing as how I've been on their support line waiting (as I type this) for over an hour
