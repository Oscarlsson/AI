What a disappointment!  The device just wasn't predictable.  Sometimes it would do as expected, sometimes not.  It was just a crapshoot.  Finally unplugged it and it's in a drawer somewhere.  Yes, I played with the sensitivity with no success.  Getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince The Clapper to do its thing.  Save your money and look elsewhere
