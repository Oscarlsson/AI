Skip this entire product. I made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non-scrubbing (mopping?) pads. Now, I can't find the non-scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county. I think they don't want to compete with their own product "Swiffer" which they also manufacture. I emailed them and they suggested I buy online. I checked walgreens.com and drugstore.com and no luck. I imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful "who gives a hoot" rod.
