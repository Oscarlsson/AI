I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub.  I am disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so I don't feel too bad about the wasted money
