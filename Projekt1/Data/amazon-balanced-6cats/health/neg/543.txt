I got this device to help me clean around my place.  I thought it would be easy to use, and it is  not.  The pads do not stay on.  When you are trying to put them on, the solution leaks all over you.  After working on my shower, I saw no difference.  I wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth.
