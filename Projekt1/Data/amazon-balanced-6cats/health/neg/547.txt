this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best. when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0. the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs. give or take a few from clothes... i was extremely shocked! how could i weigh THAT much!! turns out the scale was off approx. 20 pounds 20 POUNDS!
