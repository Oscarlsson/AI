I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB so I thought I would like this too. However, it just doesn't work. The cartridges they have set up don't work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it's taut. But because of the way they have the cartridges set up, there is no way to make it taut again. It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed, but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges.

This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use. So... forget it
