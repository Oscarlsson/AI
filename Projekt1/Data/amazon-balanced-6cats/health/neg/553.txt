I agreed with all the criticism that the Revlon eyelash curler (now discontinued) received. It broke quickly and used up batteries by the truckload. But the one thing it did well that the Carmen curler does poorly is to provide the type of construction and shape that keeps you from accidently squeezing pieces of eyelid skin. This instrument catches my skin very easily and it's hard to get good curled lashes without hurting my eyelids
