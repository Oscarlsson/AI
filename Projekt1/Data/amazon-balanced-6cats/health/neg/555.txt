Amazon is claming:
*	Great entry-level charger system 
*	Charges four AA / AAA NiMH batteries in 6-10 hours 
*	Includes four 2300mAh NiMH AA batteries 
It is only 1800mAh which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards, while if it was as Amazon claims it would have been a nice step up. Shame on Amazon, oversight or misrepresentation. Charger is cheaply made. It can charge 4 AA or only 2 AAA. Poor design. The charger that came with my camera can do 4 AAA, go figure. Get something else.
