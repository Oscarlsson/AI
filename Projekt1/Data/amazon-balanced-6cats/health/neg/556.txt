we bought this as a cheap/easy stocking stuffer. It's simply not woth anything.  The little file is a good idea, but too tiny to actually work.  My daughter (8yrs old) liked the idea too, but was sad that she couldn't work with the tiny strip that's too short for even her little fingers. Cute, but not worth it
