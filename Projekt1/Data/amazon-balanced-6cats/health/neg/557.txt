The reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best, so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [I might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured (and no longer airborne) housefly buzzing in circles]. With respect to the heat(ing), it does perform better, but is by no means stellar. 

The Pro's are its design for moisture, a better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off. 

The Con's include, as others have said, a HUGE AC-DC plug/power pack, no apparent ability to WASH the darn thing, only modest heat, annoying Velcro straps, a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together, but can't be removed from the main pad for washing AND, perhaps most significantly, the fact that mine died after approx. 18 months (which, incidentally, raises yet another detractor; the Warranty is only a year, much less than many other brands)
