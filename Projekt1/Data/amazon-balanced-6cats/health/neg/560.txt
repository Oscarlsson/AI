If you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes, this thing works acceptably well, but if you're mixing something like "Ionic Fizz" magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit, it's not very useful because it just doesn't form a very good seal, no matter how tightly you close it. As another reviewer mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid.  Thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help.

It is great for sipping though, and easy enough to keep clean. But I went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it. The seal on this bottle is too flaky because it's difficult to tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it. 

I'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has. I don't use this any more, because it's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading. Don't waste your money on it.
