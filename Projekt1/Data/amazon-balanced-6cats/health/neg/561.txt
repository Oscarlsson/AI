At first, this seems like a pretty good drink shaker.  The body and lid are fairly sturdy.  However, there's a separate rubber seal that sits inside the lid...  And if that pops out, which it's prone to do with mine, you're left with a leaky (and therefore useless) shaker.  The seal can be replaced with a bit of effort, but who wants to wrestle with a plastic bottle
