This item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly.  Also it does not work well at all.  If you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least. Many times it stays flat and when it does "rise" it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs. I would have returned the item, but I left it for my mother when I had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time I returned my 30 day window was closed.  DO NOT BUY, you will regret it if you do. I won't even put this item in a yard sale, because I would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it.
