I read the directions and followed them to a T. The pain was just too intense (on my gums - they started to bleed!). I tried to adjust the "trays" every which way, but there was no way not to get the gel on my gums. After all the time, trouble and pain, I didn't see ANY improvement in whiteness. I have used the older Crest Whitestrips, and liked them much better.
