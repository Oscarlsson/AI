I have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest.  HOWEVER, I was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow Advil.  I used Sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help, but nothing seemed to work.   The taste isn't bad and I used the bleach with my own trays that I had made by my dentist, so it didn't leak out or touch my gums.  My teeth weren't sensitive while I was using it or even right afterwards, but later in the day.  If you have sensitive teeth, I do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain
