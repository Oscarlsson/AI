Ok...received this item last night...used once, and in the process realized I was pointing a laser beam on my skull.  Given the directions say 3 times a week, 15 minutes per, I would have to do this for a long time with no proven results...Save yourself the time...do this...Go to google and type in "Forum and HairPro".  You will find next to nothing regarding information for this product.  I made an impulse purchase getting sucked in to the exploitation...after further research even the top rated hairmaxx brush selling for $500 has mixed results on the online forums.  Not to mention that Viatek had spelling errors in the pamphlet that came with the product...If they don't have the time to make sure all is spelled right in the manual, how much time did they spend creating the actual product.  The box had a date of 2005 and there was dust all over it.  These lasers may work, but with all the research I did (after the purchase) results seem minimal for all the work that needs to be done.  I felt ridiculous using the thing too.  I am just annoyed because again I got sucked into a new gimmick for something that companies can exploit in individuals.
