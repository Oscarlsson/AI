I bought this and it worked fine the first time that I used it.  Granted, it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom.  However, I have tried it in my infant's room 4 times this winter.  I used HOT water & salt to try to help it, but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam.  Maybe all of the "steam" energy is being used on the night light!  If you have your home's thermostat set under 78 degrees, do not waste your money on this item!  Find something stronger to get you through the winter months
