NO MOVING PARTS contrary to depiction above. The "attachments" are tiny plastic 1.5" knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet! They do not move. There is no massaging action - YOU DO ALL THE WORK, making your hips and knees sore. The "massaging foot beds" are totally motionless and form a spiky, painful surface. Vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device. Jets are totally underpowered. No fill line indicator so "Bubbles" spill water onto floor. Heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different. Cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads. Classic deception in advertising
