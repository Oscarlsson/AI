A total Piece of Garbage, do not buy this at all.

First of all it is battery operated which i did not know when i bought it.  Secondly, when i went to put batteries in it, the terminals in side of it are offset, one is higher than the other, and the higher terminal was damaged.  When i put the batteries in and put the cover on it did not work, the case was pushing the battery away from the terminal.  It worked without the cover on but that doesnt do anyone any good if u cant prevent the batteries from falling out.  The thing is rather loud too and cover is a piece of cheap plastic.   The thing is a Piece of Garbae, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!
