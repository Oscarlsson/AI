This protien works well to curb my appitite for hours on end, but it has a horrible taste and texture.  The closest thing I can relate it to is chocolate-burned egg tasting boogers.  I would not purchase this product again.  I would, however, purchase from the vender again because it is not their fault that this protien tastes so bad
