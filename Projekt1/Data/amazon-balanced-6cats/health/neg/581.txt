I got one of these to help me after I had major surgery.  I have better than average hand and arm strength, but I found this particular model to be hard to operate (I can't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it).  Normal sized cans (like soup or beans) slipped out of its pitiful grip.  I wound up using it just to roll things to myself when I dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash.  This is definitely a lightweight... too light for much real use.  I should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more
