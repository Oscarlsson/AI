I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased this item.  &quot;What the heck,&quot; I thought.  I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning.  This was instead of the recommendation of twice a day.  I like the stuff.  My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy.  In fact, I'd give it five stars except that now it's three weeks since I purchased this product and 'poof!' it's gone!  I figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt.  In my mind the 'goodness' of this product isn't worth the exorbitant price.  Hence, two stars
