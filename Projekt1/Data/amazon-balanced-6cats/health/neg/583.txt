I just received my brush(es) hair dryer yesterday 3/9/07 ... tried it out today - for 5 MINUTES ... I absolutely hate it.  It's the worst, by far, hair appliance I've ever owned.  I guess you get what you pay for ... but I've owned Revlon products in the past, and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money.  I cannot return it, because the return cost would be too expensive, too much trouble, and I guess it will go in the dumpster.  I hate it - don't make the same mistake I made.  One big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and doesn't grip the hair.  Just take it from this written testimony - it's a piece of junk
