I like to use the wet wipes, they're good products. I gave only 2 stars because the package wasn't packed well. I received the package this week. All seals of three boxes were broken, lids fell off, and the wipes were everywhere in the package, they were dried up, but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet, and it almost fell apart. What a mess it was!
