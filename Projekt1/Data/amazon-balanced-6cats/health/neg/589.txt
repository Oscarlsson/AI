--as I found it to be really much too fake-lemony, not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms. I mixed mine w/ a subtle "cookie"-type one I coudn't smell at all & now can smell neither, even when I put them in closets, which was not the idea--I like a little fragrance thru the house. May look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood
