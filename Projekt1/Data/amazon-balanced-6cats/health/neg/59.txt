Ordered this item on Sept 28. They were supposed to ship it within 1 week. After 1 week I received an email, they said they needed 2 more weeks. Another email today (Nov 7), they think they can deliver it by November 27. That's 2 months after I placed my order. At this point, I am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year. Fortunately with Amazon, they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order, which is what I am going to do right now
