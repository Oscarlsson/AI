the pick at the back of the unit is curved and doesn't work well.

the floss is multi-stranded and tends to come apart when used and doesn't feel like it is very high quality floss.

the head is also somewhat small or poorly shaped so it is also difficult to use.

i used the plackers brand before and was much happier with it
