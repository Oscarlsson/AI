Both my wife and I have high blood pressure, which our doctor would like us to track at home. After checking out many brands and styles of automatic monitors, and based on the reviews here, I didn't hesitate to buy the Mark of Fitness, Inc monitor (Prevention edition).  When I received it, there were two problems: First, there was no owner's manual inside. Since I kept getting an "err 2" message, I had no way of checking what that meant. (Amazon.com suggested I look online for a pdf version somewhere. Unfortunately, the Mark of Fitness' web site didn't have online manuals.)  The second and more important problem with this product was that it was clearly very inaccurate.  When I finally was able to get some readings, they were: 112/64, 106/60, 96/61, 106/62, 109/64, and 115/62.  Oh, how I wish some of those WERE my readings!  Maybe it was just my misfortune to get that one in 500 lemons with no owner's manual and who knows what else wrong with it, but unfortunately, I won't take a chance on trying another one.  It's going back today
