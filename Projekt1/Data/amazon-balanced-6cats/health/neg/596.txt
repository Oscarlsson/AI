I followed the directions on the package but could not get these disks to adhere to my canker sore, even one in the flattest part of my cheek.  Obviously, they won't stick to sores on the gumline or inside of lip either.  CANKAID and Kank+A are still the non-prescription products I have found that provide relief and are much easier to apply
