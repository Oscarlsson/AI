When I ordered this item, I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use.  Actually, each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it, to be used once and discarded.  Let me see:  a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365,000,000 plastic doodads added to the world's landfills every year.  I already compromise my principles for convenience more than I'd like to admit.  This is totally over the top.   When I've used up my supply of flossers, out this thing goes.  It goes into the landfill, to be sure.  So don't anyone else make my mistake
