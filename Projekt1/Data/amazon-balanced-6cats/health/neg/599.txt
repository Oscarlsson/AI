If you think you are buying the old Met-RX bars by the same flavors, you are in for a very very bad surprise. The old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency. These were so sticky that I could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one.  Also, I couldn't get past the taste. Even the color is different. 

I never finished the bar and I used to eat one a day (years ago). I gave the entire box away for free.

I will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe.
