The best thing I can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results.

The actual results varied greatly from those I received from my doctor 3 months prior:

(...)

Both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast.  All instructions were followed.  I find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months.  I contacted BioSafe customer service.   All representatives were busy on my first call so I left a message, which was not returned.  I called again and was able to speak to someone right away.  The customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods (finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm) will vary "slightly".   (...)  I question the accuracy of the biosafe results.
