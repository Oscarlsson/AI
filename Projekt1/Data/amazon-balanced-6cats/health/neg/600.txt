This bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true. What is also true is that is contains more fat. 

What you will notice with the first bite, is that the bar seems somehow "inflated". There is an emptiness to consistency of the bar. You are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a Myoplex or Apex bar. Stick with those brands for pure nutrition and FAR BETTER TASTE. 

These METRX bars leave you feeling as though you've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert, yet these will not be mistaken for desserts
