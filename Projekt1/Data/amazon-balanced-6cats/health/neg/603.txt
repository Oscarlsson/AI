I couldn't even make it to that "magic" fourth or fifth day when all cravings are supposed to magically disappear. From the very beginning, I was so incredibly jittery, which is 1 of the claims Hoodia reps make. I, also feel sleepy all the time, yet I can't nap and my sleep has been severely disrupted by all the jitteriness- I'm what you call TOO TIRED TO SLEEP! REALLY, how many over-the counter appetite suppressants actually work. I believe none of them work better than a placebo (and maybe that's what some of you are experiencing?). DON'T BOTHER WITH this one. A total waste of a lot of money - this stuff isn't exactly cheap, either; take your $$ and go buy some sneakers, get a little exercise & you'll be a lot better off!
