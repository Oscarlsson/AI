These did NOT suppress my appetite, though many days I took 3 tablets three times a day!  Had very good luck with a bottle of Dytrexil (also a Hoodia product), but the next bottle of THAT, nothing.  I guess like crops, you can get good batches and bad batches.  These struck me as a bad batch.  As one reviewer said, I actually felt HUNGRIER many days.  Egad!  Better luck next time!  Sigh
