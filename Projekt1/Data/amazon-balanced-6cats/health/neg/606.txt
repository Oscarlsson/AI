We started getting a "LO" message when using the thermometer. It said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense. This worked for a little while. We changed the tip on each use.  Now nothing works. After spending near $50 on this I feel like a chump. I want to throw it out the window. I'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else
