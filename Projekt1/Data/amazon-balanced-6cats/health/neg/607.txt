i bought it 15 days back and it broke when i am chopping onion.. but its great to cut soft vegetables and even carrot is also good.. but i couldnt cut onions as mentioned.. probably we have to buy the onions from them hahhahaha... i dont suggest buying it for onions.. coz i bought only for onions so that i could save my tears
