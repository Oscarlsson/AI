LCD fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker wasn't stong enough. Anyhow,I could push it back. Then, the scale couldn't be turned on by tapping on the top. This is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual. I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken. This is the problem I can't fix.  The only thing I can do is sending it back. 
Following up: According to the other review, I tried to make this scale "vibrating" using different ways of tapping. It didn't work no matter how hard I tried. I had to use my toe to lift up one side a little (about half an inch) and drop it on hard floor to make enough "vibration" to turn it on. I wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on. My Soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping. I have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate. Just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass. And also, be careful to use it in bathroom: moisture will make the glass surface slippery.
