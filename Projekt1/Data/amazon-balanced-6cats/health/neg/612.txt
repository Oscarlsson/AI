I purchased this because it was so cute, and had the Conair name.  Within 6 weeks, the bulb blew out, and I started looking for a replacement.  Ive been to all the local places, and everyplace I could find online.  In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage.  The only place I could get the correct bulb was on the conair website -- but they make you buy 10 bulbs, then charge $9.00 for handling.  The cost is more than just buying a new mirror!  a rip off
