The mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell. After receiving it, I left it in an open room for 2 weeks before I can sleep on it. The "free" pillow smells even worse. It can be not exchanged since it is "free". I guess I am supposed to toss it since it's "free".                 I think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable, after all.
