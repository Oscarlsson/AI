I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense.  I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed.  I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply.  However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom.  I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place.  My solution was to use bottles.  They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice
