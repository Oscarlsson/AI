I bought this curling iron impulsively, as I perused through the "gold box" items some time ago.  When I first received the it, I was amazed at how well it worked; it heated up quickly, and did a wonderful job on my hair.  After a couple months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached.  I thought about returning it, but decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use it...BIG MISTAKE.  It heated up way beyond what it should have, even when I put it at a "low" setting of 5.  When I attempted to use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed, made a mistake.  The next day, coworkers were commenting on my lovely new SHORT haircut.  If you're really interested in purchasing this item, please learn from my mistake, and if the tip melts off, take that as a sign that it will also melt your hair
