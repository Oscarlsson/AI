I used huggies pullups with my older child and started using them with my younger one. When they came out with Dora on the easy ups and our grocery store had a huge Dora display, my daughter had to use Dora not the pullups which have the disney princess design which she is not that into(I personally think the disney princesses are not a good choice for potty training age 2-3 year olds, I would assume that Dora would be picked by more children that age). First off the smallest size they have is big for the average 2-3 year old. They did have a size 2t but from what I have seen it has been discountined. I don't know if it is because they are a little big or the quality they do leak. I have never had a huggies pullup leak on me but these easy have on a regular basis. The design definetly got my daughter not wanting diapers and on the road to potty training but the leakage didn't make it easy for me. I would never use these for overnight use, pullups absorb so much better in an overnight situation. Now if pampaers could make a better product or huggies could make a better design then I would be happy
