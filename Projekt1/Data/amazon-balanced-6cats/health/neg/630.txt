This isn't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling. However, the folding handle did eventually break and I had to modify it to hold it together. I haven't noticed any benefit from the ion control, mine and my wife's hair get's easily frizzled with this dryer, plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed. The switch is definitely very difficult to use, there's no way a person can use it with one hand.  If you tried, you'd end up dropping the thing. The fact that the off position is between the two speed settings isn't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position. Personally, I can't wait to find her a better one so I can tear this one apart for more interesting things. On the upside, after fixing the handle, it has worked without any real problems for 6 months
