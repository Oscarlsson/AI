The only reason that I am writing this review is because I am on line now looking for a new trimmer.  I bought this "gem" less than a year ago and was not satisfied then.  Tonight, I'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out.  The extra cutting heads are all but worthless.  I would never recommend this P.O.S to anybody.
I wish I could give it 0 stars
