I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower.  Even though that's possible, the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head.  The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better.  I can't believe Panasonic thinks they'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective
