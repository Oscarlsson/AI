Printed all over the box are the words "with infrared heat".  The instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start, and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water's warm temperatures.  This wouldn't be the case.  The water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on.  Turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice, but does nothing at all to keep the water warm.
