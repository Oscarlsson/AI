While the product works it's good.  It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair.  The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless.  It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality.
