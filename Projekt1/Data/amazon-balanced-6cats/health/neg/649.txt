This epilator by Emjoi does NOT WORK without the cord attached - the motor is too weak. In addition, the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends - the middle disks, since they are inset from the top, never reach the hair. I had to return this item, and I would not trust or recommend ANY item by Emjoi. Extremely poor quality, and does not work as promised
