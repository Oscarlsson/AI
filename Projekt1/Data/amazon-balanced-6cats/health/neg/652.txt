I bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself.  Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep.  Impossible to do both at the same time.  Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results.  The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked.  Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women.  Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female.   I was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back
