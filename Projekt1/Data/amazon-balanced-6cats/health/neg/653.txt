Edible taste, not the best but I would keep buying them if i didn't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea.  It is not just this met-rx bar that will do this to you, it is any food with sugar alcohols.  All Atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol.  They do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do, so the theory is that they dont store fat.  Only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom.  You only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom.  Not Worth It
