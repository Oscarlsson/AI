I paid 50 bucks for a pen that is already leaking on its third day of use. The craftsmanship is shoddy. The packaging itself has nicks on it. The pen is leaking from the silver ring above the first one. I've had to use scotch tape on it so that it doesn't keep staining my fingers. The box says made in China, and well quite frankly, the product seems to be exactly that, made in China.

I always thought Cross was suppose to be a good brand of pens, but I now know they aren't. The problem for me is I ordered 3 of these pens and one ball point one all at the same time so I could give a few of them away as gifts. What am I going to do now? This bites
