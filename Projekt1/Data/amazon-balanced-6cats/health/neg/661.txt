After using the dryer (which I liked very much and did a quick job), I discovered that my hair was being ruined.  It would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces.

I stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair.

I would like to return it and get my money back!!!
