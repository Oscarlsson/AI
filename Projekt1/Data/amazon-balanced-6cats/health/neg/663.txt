plain and simple i'm 32 years old and been dianosed with HBP since 15 years old. I'm on three medication for HBP. I order this then i wait for it to come. i jjust happen to go to the doctor today, he takes my pressure and tells me its 113/100. when i arrive home one hour later, the device is waiting for me. i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is 101/75. Sending the unit back
