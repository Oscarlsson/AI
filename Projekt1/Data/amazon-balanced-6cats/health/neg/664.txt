I don't know, but.. I couldn't get myself to swallow it. It made me, literally, vomit. I wish I just ordered Power Bar's Vanilla-Yoghurt flavored one, which tastes fantastic and I love so very much.

Anyway, probably it's just me but, it really really makes me sick.. I thought I would taste something new but oh well..
