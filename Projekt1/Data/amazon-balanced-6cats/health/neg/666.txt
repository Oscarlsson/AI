Absolute waste of money, this is not a Pillow as advertised, in my opinion falsely, but a flat mat which, when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this. You could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all. An extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution. Now out of pocket and no better off.
