I got this as a gift for Christmas, and I've tried it twice so far. Both times I get the same result - it doesn't work. I understand that with wet hair, it won't dry it, obviously. But even with damp hair, as instructed, it doesn't get my hair dry. As for the actual straightening aspect, I still end up with frizzy hair that isn't even all that straight. It's not worth the money - spend the extra bucks and get a Chi or Infrashine, you'll be a lot better off
