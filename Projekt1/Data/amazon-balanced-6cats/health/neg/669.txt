I wanted a good reading lamp and bought this lamp after doing a bit of research.  After taking the very heavy lamp out of the box and assembling it, I turned it on to find that it gives off very little light.  I thought it might be something I would need to get used to and sat down that night to read only to find that my eyes were straining under the light.  I tried using the lamp during the day/twilight and found that the illumination of the lamp was barely noticable.  Though it was quite a feat to put the lamp back into the box it was shipped in, I returned it to Amazon which is something I rarely do
