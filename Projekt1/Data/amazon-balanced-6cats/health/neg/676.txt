It's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror, I suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification.  The light is not great at all.  It's very dim.  One of the good qualities of the mirror is that it's cordless and comes with an adapter if you don't have batteries handy
