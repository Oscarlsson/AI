This one's going back to the store.  It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat.  If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat.  As for the "massage", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu.  I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet
