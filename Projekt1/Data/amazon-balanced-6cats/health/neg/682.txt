After 5 days of minimal use, this pad stopped working. Kaz replaced it. After 3 days of use, the pad stopped working again. Kaz replaced it again. After 7 days of use, the pad stopped working a third time, but this time Kaz VOIDED the warranty! Then, they said I should get an electric blanket if I wanted to keep warm. I wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache
