This product is called a "Bouffant Style Oversized" shower cap.
It is so small that it would not fit over my wife's head.
The product features list claims it is made of "soft, pretty fabric."
In fact it is made of thin, crunchy plastic.
It is so poorly made that the stiching is crooked, overlaps and has threads hanging in several places.
This shower cap went directly in the garbage
