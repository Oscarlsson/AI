The friend who I purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too FAST for her to keep up with.  She is used to a two wheeled walker, but wanted one with a seat.  She didn't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund.  It turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund; so she didn't return it.  The lesson: better buy local if you're not sure
