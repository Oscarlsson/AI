too difficult to program, have had 2 weeks and still have not
been able to complete process, instructions stay on screen
too short a time, all i am able to get is weight, cannot see
other information on screen unless on floor and right on top
of it, would send back but too much of a hassel and expense,
too expensive for a scale that is only to give me my current
weigh
