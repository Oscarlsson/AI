I ordered the Ergo Lounger.  When I arrived, I was shocked to find that I could barely lift the box that it came in. I wanted to move it to another room to unpack.  This was supposed to be lightweight "aluminum" but the box clearly said "steel."  I did NOT want one that would rust because I intended to carry it to the beach to use it.  I actually called the Manufacturer (they provided a toll free number) several times.  Never did they answer the phone, nor did they ever return any of my calls.  So I could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not.  The lounger itself seemed pretty nice, just too heavy and probably would rust soon
