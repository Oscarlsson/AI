This is an overpriced, under designed lounger.  The concept is cool, the product is not.  The idea of being able to read while face down is completely useless if you wear glasses.  Very uncomfortable.  I am glad I bought mine from Amazon as opposed to the $200 plus other retailers wanted  last summer
