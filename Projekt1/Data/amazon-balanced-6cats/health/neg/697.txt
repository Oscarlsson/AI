While one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool, the manufacture has indeed done so. The "spoon" portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil. I supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility, but instead of using a fastener or weld, its just rolled metal inserted into the coil. After only two uses the "spoon" came out of the coil and even though I could easily enough put it back together, after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay. Basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now. Would recommend buying a more simply designed, single piece shoe horn.
