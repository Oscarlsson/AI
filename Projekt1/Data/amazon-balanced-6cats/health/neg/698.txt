i cannot agree with any person who gives this over 1 star. The main problem I had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department. I swear, it was like bathing in GATORADE. And while I'm sure that AXE was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory, but the smell is far too fragrant. And if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality, think again. I was a lot happier with Snake Peel
