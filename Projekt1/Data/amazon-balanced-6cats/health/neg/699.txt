I ordered this and, while I'm a fan of other Therabeads products, I found this poorly designed.  Unless you have a very thick neck, the velcro straps are worse than useless.  They either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover.  The only way I could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck -- and then it didn't cover the neck well.
