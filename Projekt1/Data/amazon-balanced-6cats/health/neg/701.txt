To get hot lather, which is nice, you first have to get the device installed on top the can.  I would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated.  The directions provided are sparse in several languages.  First you have to pry the top off the can of shaving cream.  They provide a pry tool for that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream better than others.  Then you have to fit the device on top the can.  It worked well with one brand in a large size can.  When I tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half the can during the installation process.  Using a different brand in a large can, I had trouble prying the top off the can.  If you have time and patience, and are willing to spend some money on various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well, give it a try.  Otherwise, be forewarned it may lead to frustration and bad language. 

It would be nice if companies intending to sell products in the US (apparently manufactured somewhere in Asia) would provide a clear set of instuctions in English, in reasonable large readable type, with illustrations.  In this case, they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for.  I do not need instructions in foreign languages, and get tired of limited instructions in six languages
