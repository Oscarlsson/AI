The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product
