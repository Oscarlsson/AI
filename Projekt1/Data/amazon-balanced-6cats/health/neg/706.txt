The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was. It was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something.
The other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was.  The bonnnet was difficult to get on, mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place, and kept pulling the bonnet off my head.
After a couple of trys and reading the instructions, I knew I would never use it, simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head.
Whoever designed this product should be demoted
