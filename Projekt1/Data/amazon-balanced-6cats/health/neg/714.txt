WARNING:  THIS SYSTEM COULD BE HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH AND HAPPINESS and walls.
1.)  The danged clippy thingy is very difficult to snap on to the HOT, damp, roller, so it is very easy to burn fingers while trying to manipulate it. 
2.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw roller and clippy thingy at the wall.
3.) The Sadistic designer only made ONE WAY for the You-can't-put-a-square-peg-in-a-round-hole variously sized rollers to be replaced in the unit after use.  This puzzle remains unsolved by this reviewer. 
4.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged unit, rollers and clippy thingies included, at the wall.
5.) Even if you only use a few of the rollers on your hair, you have to take them ALL OUT of the unit - (the better to play the afore-mentioned puzzle game, my dear) to dump the unused water out of the unit prior to storage.
6.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged water-filled unit, rollers and clippy thingies included, at the wall.
