I bought it new. After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me. 

I checked the manual before I used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower. I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water. 

Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as far as I am concerned
