My rheumatologist recommended that I try a wax bath product for the osteoarthritis in my thumbs.  The cartiledge in the left thumb is all but gone, with the right thumb being in better shape.  The wax bath did not eliminate or ease the pain in either thumb, but did greatly improved the skin on both hands.  I continue to use it just for the dry skin on my hands, and am pleased with the results.  It's possible that this product would have worked better for me if I'd used it earlier, before my thumbs got so bad.  I plan to use the wax bath for the pain from inflammation in my feet, due to rheumatoid arthritis.  I did have to turn down the heat due to a lifelong and extreme sensitivity to heat in my hands, and this is probably why the wax doen't stay warm for longer than 10 - 12 minutes, even when wrapped in the plastic bags and then in a towel.  The initial loading of wax has lasted a long time, so I don't recommend purchasing more than 2 or 3 pounds of wax at a time
