I decided to try the caffeine free Mega-T because I quit caffeine a couple years ago and didn't want a diet supplement with caffeine.  I only needed to lose 10 pounds.  Took as directed for 1 week.  Also followed the diet and exercise program per the enclosed pamphlet.  After 1 week, to my dismay, I actually gained 3 pounds!  I contacted CCA Industries, the company that makes Mega-T, and they promptly informed me that they have a 30 day guarantee and to return them, along with my receipt, for a refund.  I shipped them back yesterday.  I gave a 2 star rating because of CCA Industries' customer service
