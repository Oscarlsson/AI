The photo of this product is extremely beautiful and its supposed functions are very attractive, so I bought it even though the existing reviews are mostly negative. 

Well, the reviews are right. This product arrived unassembled. I stared at the obscure instruction and the parts that does not seem to be able to hold in any way for a good couple of minutes, and decided this is not for me. And by the way, without the beautiful blue light showing on the photo, this thing looks like a lifeless vase made of pale glass. 

As I re-pack this thing back, I noticed that it has actually been opened and re-sealed before. That means someone bought it and decided to return it as well. That says a lot about this product.
