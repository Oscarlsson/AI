I thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where I don't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth.  But contrary to what's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses, which ended up dirtier than they started.

The wipes work okay on a computer screen, though
