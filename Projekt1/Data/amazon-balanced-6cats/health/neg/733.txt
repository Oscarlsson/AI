They have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut.  My hair is very short and this is unusual.  If you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out.  I spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better.  I would have been better buying a cheap pair at Walmart, which I normally do
