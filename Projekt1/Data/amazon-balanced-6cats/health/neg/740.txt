At first, I thought this product was great, and I used it for a few days. Then, I noticed that my face was getting red and swollen. Now, I look all deformed. I am really upset!! The acid ate away at my face and I am still waiting for my face to heal. I called Neutrogena and they said it is probably an allergic reaction. 



March 23, 2007, Update: After the swelling on my face went down, my whole body started itching, and I had to go see two different doctors. The internist said that it got into my system, and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of my system. I took the medication for over 2 weeks, and used Cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching. My arms and legs are all scared. There are still marks now even though my arms and legs have healed. This was the worst product that I have ever used, and I don't even have sensitive skin. I never had a problem with a product ever!! I was very careful when I used Rapid Clear. It never got in my eyes, nose, or mouth. I used it once a day for a week until my face swelled up and turned all red. I looked like the character on Mask. Horrifying!!! I will never ever buy another dangerous product from Neutrogena, again!!!! I will tell everyone what happened to me!!! The funny thing is..... one person that I told this to, who also saw my swollen face,.... she said this exact thing happened to her with another Neutrogena product. So, I know it's not just me! What the heck is Neutrogena putting in their products?
