I have to say i am disappointed, Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916,  which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon. 

the one i received was much cheaper in quality. The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped. The guide shattered. There is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 I can find.

Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.

On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is incredible.
