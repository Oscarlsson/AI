Don't buy this product. I went through two units with the same problem. The trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade. Within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached. Further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed, Wahl should be embararssed. 
It did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove, the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that I would have given it no stars if possible. 
The fact that I returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth
