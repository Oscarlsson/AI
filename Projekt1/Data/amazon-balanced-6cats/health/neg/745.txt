Tried this product for 2 weeks; it did improve the clarity and softness, but I found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well, seemed to have a sticky feel.  Since then, I found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called Microdermx by Nikkel Holistic Skincare. This product performs like magic; it is not too scratchy and I can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like I've been slapped with a wire brush.  I can do the treatment 2-3x's a week, (like your supposed to) but I also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before. It is a magical product.
