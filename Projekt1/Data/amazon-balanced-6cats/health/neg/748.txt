This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1&quot; thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality
