This product almost had me going to the ER. I felt a little flush so I used this monitor to check my blood pressure. It was 151/98. A second check showed 148/100. I then really started feeling flush as a wave of burning flushed my body. My wife an RN said calm down, breath deeply. I went over to my Rottweiler and started hugging and petting her. After about 10 min. I felt the flushness go away but the blood pressure showed 162/99. I made a Dr's appointment and brought the machine with me. In his office where my pressure always is elevated when he 1st takes it, I used the machine in front of him and my pressure was 153/107. I really got nervous. He took it with his machine and it was 140/82. You won't believe the relief. He took it again with another machine and it had come down to 135/80. I'd like to return the machine for a non-digital one. I've seen this before with a digital machine from a different company
