This device worked about 80% of the time on myself and only about 10% of the time on my father.  Unfortunately, it was a Christmas gift for him and not for me.  
 We ended up getting a self inflating one at Circuit City that seems to be working just fine.
 It IS possible that the problem lies with him - possible faint heartbeat or high blood pressure but it is odd that the one at CC worked just fine
