My biggest issue with this shaker is that it doesn't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap. Even if I really tighten it up, I still get a small leak when I shake it. Also, the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy. But overall it gets the job done, and having fluid graduations on the side are nice
