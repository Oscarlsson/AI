I bought this product b/c I can't stand the feeling of hair/stubble on my legs. I got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave. This product indicated I could remove hair in about the same amount of time, but that it would last much longer than shaving. I purchased it and waited a week to receive it. Once I received it, I spent 40 minutes using it. In this time, I could have shaved both legs, both underarms, and my bikini line twice. Using this product, I was not even done with one leg. I went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period, and it did not remove a single hair. I pressed lightly, I pressed hard, I did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach, and nothing made this product work as indicated. Others may have had luck with it, but I did not. I was not impressed and I would not recommend it to anyone.
