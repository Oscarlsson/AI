Beware! This thing, even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure, as well as not keep it in one spot, it took the top layer of skin off! My poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work. Ow! I had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed. And what's worse, it didn't take out all the hair.... I could still see some hair here and there it missed, and I thought I got it all. I returned it immediately and got a refund on my money. Never again.... I'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead....
