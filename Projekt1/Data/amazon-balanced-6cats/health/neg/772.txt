I like this hairdryer.. when it works! It has broken twice on me.. the first time it starting spitting out sparks so I sent it back.. they sent me a new one (of course I had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back) and now it only works on low, the high is broken.. I am going to throw it out and get a different brand.. Not impressed!
