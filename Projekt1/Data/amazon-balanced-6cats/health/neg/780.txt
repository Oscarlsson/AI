Like everyone else has said - the controls on this dryer suck! If your fingers are at all wet or greasy from product, it is a struggle to flip the switches. I don't know if the ionic feature did anything or not. I suppose I'll know once I compare it to the replacement I'm about to buy. 

I had the dryer for about a year...and now it's gone. As I was drying my hair last week I noticed sparks shooting out of the nozzle! Yikes. I cleaned out the filter and the sparks stopped. It lasted maybe 3 more uses before it just went dead. No smoke, no fires, just nothing. I expect a longer life from a simple appliance like this. Back to Target I go..
