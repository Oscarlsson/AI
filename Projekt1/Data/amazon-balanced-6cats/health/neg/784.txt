I was pretty excited to try an ION hairdryer. I got this one because I liked the idea of being able to 'control' the amount of ions coming out. 

My hair DID seem a little shinier after using it (the only reason I gave it two stars and not one) but my hair felt a little drier. Almost straw-ish...it never felt like that with my old drier. 

Also the buttons really are hard to switch...all of them! I read another review that said that and I thought well how bad can it be? I dry my hair with a round brush in my right hand and the dryer in the left. I turn the dryer on and off during different times while I am doing my hair. With this dryer I could NOT turn the on/off switch with my left hand. I had to put down my brush and use both hands. I could not believe how hard it was to switch! This was the main deciding factor in returning the dryer, it was SO frustrating not to be able to switch it easily with a flick of your thumb. Not to mention made me feel like a big wussy!!!

The speed setting only has two settings, low and high. The low setting was way too low and the high setting was way too high. A middle ground would have been nice. 

Lastly, the dryer smelled a little weird. Granted, I only had it two days before I returned it, so the smell might eventually disappear. But it wasn't your normal 'new hairdryer, hot plastic' smell. It was almost a slight mildew smell. Yuk.

So, I would NOT recommend getting it. I exchanged it for the Vidal Sassoon ion sensor dryer. That seems to be working better. The low speed setting is perfect. The smell is normal 'new dryer' smell so far. The buttons are EASY to push!!!!  The sensor (it automatically turns off when you pur it down) is a little off, it takes a while to turn off. But all in all I like it. And it also DOES make my hair shiny and DOES NOT make it feel drier or like straw!
