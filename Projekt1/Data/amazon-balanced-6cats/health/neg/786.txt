I got this product to help me sleep and it did NOT work for me.  I used to take some pain killer/sleep aid made by Members Mark and that worked great, but I no longer need the pain killer.  I bought this and have tried it 3 times now, and I can't quite explain it but it did not make me tired.  It made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired, plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times I used it.  Not only did it not make me drowsy, I couldn't sleep and I woke up several times during the night.  I think I would have done better without it.  But everyone reacts to drugs differently, so try at your own risk
