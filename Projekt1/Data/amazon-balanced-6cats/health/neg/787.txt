I purchased this product in an attempt to help out with jet-lag and it worked really well.  I've used it a few times since and find it doesn't send me to sleep any quicker than usual, but I don't tend to wake up through the night if I've taken it. It's obviously not something you'd want to rely on all the time, but very its handy as a occasional aid if you're having a bad run of nights. Doesn't make you feel hung-over the next day, either. Sadly, I can't buy any more because Australia doesn't recognise the product. I don't know why, because as far as I can make out its active ingredient is good old-fashioned Benadryl.
