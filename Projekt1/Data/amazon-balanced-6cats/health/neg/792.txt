I got this humidifer for my daughter's bedroom.  She loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time, then automatically shut off.  Tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail.  I had to return it.  HOWEVER, I did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter's room and that one works great.
