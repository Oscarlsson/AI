I've read a lot of reviews on this product. It obviously works for some people, but be aware it doesn't work for everyone. Me being one of the latter. I've taken it twice and both times it did nothing. First time I took it before I left for work. The drive to work I was yawning and about to fall asleep. I didn't get 5 minutes of energy let alone 5 hours. Second time I took it was about 15 minutes ago. Still nothing. I was feeling sleepy and still am. My Mom, on the other hand, says it makes her energetic as hell. It might work for you. It might not, but 5 dollars (2 pack was all they had) is a lot to waste to find out.
