Very disappointing.  The shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate.  It is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use.  Predictably, when you turn on the shower, the head drops groundward, spewing water in a horizontal spray.  Installs easily, but save your money
