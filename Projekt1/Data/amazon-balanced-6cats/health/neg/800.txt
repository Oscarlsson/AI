Of course it works great - for as long as it works. After some time, my unit develped a leak. Unlike better showerheads, the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time, causing the seals to not set properly, resulting in the kind of leak mine developed. Unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years, I'd stay away fom this model. And good luck navigating Watrepik's website to get any help
