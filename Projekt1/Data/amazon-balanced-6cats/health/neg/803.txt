I have placed the order on Oct 9th for $114.95, now on Nov 10th Amazon is asking me to approve my revised order again for $125.95. I made a mistake when I should have ordered directly from folica I could have used it for a month now! The 1 star rating has nothing to do with the product quality, since I have not used it.
