Unfortunately Total Block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin. It caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day. I don't doubt this is an excellent sunblock, just not for my rosacea sensitive skin. I use it now on my arms with no problems. 
I do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase
