Let me start by saying I think the regular Guru energy drink is the best on the market. I only wish I could say the same about GURU Lite. There is nothing positive about this drink. It is awful! I was very excited about trying the Lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage. You might as well take a Ginseng or Ginkgo Biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth. If you are big fan of the regular Guru stay with it and don't waste your money on their Lite version.
