This razor is not worth the money. It did shave pretty well for a few months, but the rubber strips wear out really quickly. And, even though the "cleaning option" with the fluid seems like a great idea... it does not work very well... the razor was never clean... and refilling the fluid is just a pain... I would not recommend this razor
