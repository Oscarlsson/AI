I bought this shaver last September, and at that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use. This past May, it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver!
