   I was attempting to order Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade, but received Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade. The packaging is so similiar. Did not realize until I opened product that I had the wrong item. Either you sent the wrong item or I inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging. I was being very careful to follow every word... so I wonder. ... does Aveda srill make the anti-Humectant Pomade. I am stuck with the wrong item now that I opened the jar. At any rate, I am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus I am minus the $22.53 amount spent
