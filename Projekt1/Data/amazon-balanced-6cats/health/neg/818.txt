conair just really does not make great hair straighteners. i bought the full size one before, and without warning it just quit working after a 2 months. i have a revlon full-size one now (which works GREAT). i recently got my hair cut short, so i decided to go buy a cheap small one to reach the short hair in the back. turn the turbo on, blast it up to the highest temperature, and it still is not even half as hot as my revlon one thats turned on minimum. i have really thin hair, and its not even curly it just gets wavy sometimes. this thing cant even straighten that much
