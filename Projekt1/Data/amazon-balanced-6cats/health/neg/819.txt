I bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually I bought it twice, since I didn't have much choice where I was shopping.  Both times it died.  The first iron lasted about 6 months, and the second lasted 2 weeks!  Just dies, no warning.  My girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a Conair!  I am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research
