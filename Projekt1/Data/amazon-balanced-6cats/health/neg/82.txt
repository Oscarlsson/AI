When I got this pedometer, I found that the instructions weren't clear.  I never did get the thing to work.  I have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate.  This one wasn't.  The pedometer doesn't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost.  It's just easier to buy a new one.  However, I suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store
