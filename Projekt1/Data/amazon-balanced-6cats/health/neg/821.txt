The first few days worked great.  I could not finish eating anything, I was full with very little to eat but after a few days the effect wore off.  I work out daily, count carlories and drink at least 74 ounces of water a day.  I did notice a slight difference in my nails and never experienced jitters but that was it.  I did not lose any weight what so ever.  I think this may be good if you want to have a bit more energy but don't expect any weight lost.
