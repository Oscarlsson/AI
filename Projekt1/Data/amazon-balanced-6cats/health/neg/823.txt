I made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it.  After just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years--my face broke out in places it had never broken out before.  It took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control. I would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you
