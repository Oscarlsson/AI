The drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them, and I could not get the hooks to work.  I finally did get one  in place and hung a medium large picture on it, and it failed.  Far short of the maximum weight on the package.   In all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and I think whey would work fine for small and medium pics.  The laser tool that was included is neat and I used it for all of my pictures, which I had to hang with other hardware
