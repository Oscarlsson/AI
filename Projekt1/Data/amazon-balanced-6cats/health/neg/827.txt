The Sharper Image offers a better product which I have been using for about a year but I wanted to try the Conair for a little more "heat." I shaved with the HGM 1 and felt pretty good about it. I returned about an hour later and it had emptied an ENTIRE can of Edge Gel (unplugged) over the bathroom counter top. Go with the Sharper Image product with this little hint: Ignore the instructions regarding the one minute warm-up and let it warm up for about 4-5 minutes and you will get a decently hot lather
