This isn't what I thought it would be.  The instructions are unclear, so I had to refer to the box to guess at how to install it.  I finally figured it out after about 10 minutes of fiddling with it.  You have push down on the top to get more than a tiny bit of gel out - so it takes two hands. That means that once you put gel on your face, you get gel on the machine. I set mine machine to the hottest setting for it to feel warm. This must be a safety thing, but I can't imagine what the lower settings are for.  The gel cools extremely fast, so by the time you apply it to your face, only the gel where you first apply it feels warm.  I had the same machine for foam and that worked a lot better, but I don't use foam shaving creme anymore.  Once I use up this can of gel, the Hot Gel Machine gets retired.
