I don't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose. I don't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all; as I said I don't have a huge melon like Mike Myers's brother in "So I Married an Axe Murderer". The idea/concept is great but...I'll probably return them. Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to using them. People with REALLY big heads, caveat emptor
