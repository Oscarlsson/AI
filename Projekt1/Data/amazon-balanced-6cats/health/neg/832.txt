I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success.
It is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time
