I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do
