I was disappointed getting this product because I've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron.  I actually prefer the cheaper Conair's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one.  It doesn't clamp down well on my hair (I've got thick frizzy hair).  The results for me aren't that great, it straightens my hair a little but it's still frizzy.  It's lightweight which is nice.  I don't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair.  I definitely prefer other models over this one.
