I've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight.  This past Christmas though I got the Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener as a gift and decided to try it out.  Not only did it not work for anything, it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass.  Also, it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener.  Needless to say, I'll be taking this back for an exchange.

I suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair
