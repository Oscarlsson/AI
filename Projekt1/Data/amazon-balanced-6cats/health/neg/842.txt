As others experienced, both packs each had two dead batteries in them. I am even using the Juice Family Charger, so it isn't a brand problem.  The packaging was a little beat up as well as if they were sitting around for a long time.  Sort of dirty. Also purchased D batteries as well and that packaging was worse.  

Hard to knock the fact they are made in China because let's admit it, pretty much everything you buy is made in China. The problem is the poor quality control from the company Juice Battery themselves.  These are actually ok batteries if they work, but not worth the price especially when taking the chance on whether they will arrive beat up or DOA.

Even though still most likely made in China, stick to the main well-known brands insread of this junk
