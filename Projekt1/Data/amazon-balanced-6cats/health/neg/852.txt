I was very eager to use this product.  I had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and I thought this would be a great replacement.  I was a little disappointed when I had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before I could get full power.  My disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses.  We can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle.  I had big hopes for this product but all I got was a big disappoinment
