This Flat Iron Combo Curler is not worth the money that I spent for it.  First of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair.  Although I must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry.  If anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work.  I wish I had spent more and got the Sedu since it had very good reviews.  Now I have to start over and buy a new one because this iron cannot be returned if it has been opened.  Now, tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used.  "DUH"
