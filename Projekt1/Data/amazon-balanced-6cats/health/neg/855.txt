I bought this product from the Discovery Channel Store and I really want to love it, but all of the green colored lights stopped working a couple weeks after I bought it.  I returned to the store where I was given a new fountain, but the same exact thing happened to the new one just a couple weeks later.  The mister still works well, but the LED lights are unpredictable at best
