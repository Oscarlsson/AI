First of all I was very disappointed when I received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead.  It is all plastic!  I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs.  I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal.  Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it.  We could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall.  We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the instructions every time, thinking we were missing something.  I eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon
