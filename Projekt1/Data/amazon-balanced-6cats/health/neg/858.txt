The pressure on the rain setting is so low you have to keep it on the concentrated spray to really wash the soap out.  Switching between the two causes a cold stream to come out for a second or two till it clears.  Also it is not sturdy - when the showerhead is moved to a higher position it does not stay and falls back down to the lower position.  I will be returning mine
