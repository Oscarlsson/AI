I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years and it worked exceptionally well.  It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all
