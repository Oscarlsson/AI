I am a reviewer and I was checking out this 'sleep aid' when it struck me as strange that almost every review for this product sounds like a promotion of the product, not a review, AND note that the reviewers have only one review (click on their 'see all my reviews').  Beware of this shoddy marketing ploy.
  
This 'crud' alone merits my one star rating.  Amazon needs to censor these reviews
