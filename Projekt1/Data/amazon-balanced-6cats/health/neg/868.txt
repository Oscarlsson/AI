Absolutely the worst cream ever! After about a week of using it, my skin turned very red and then gray/brown! I developed severe wrinkling and my skin became rubbery and loose. I went to a dermatologist who did a biopsy and said that I had developed elastolytic granulomas over the area where the cream was put - the elastin in those areas was destoyed and there was a scarring like pattern of collagen. The normal architecture of the dermal/epidermal junction was also lost - causing melanin from the epidermis to fall into the dermis - basically causing PERMANENT discoloration! Dont listen to the false hype on the net - that hype is coming from people trying to make money off this stuff - take the advice of someone who has actually USED this product - copper peptide products are NOT good for your skin
