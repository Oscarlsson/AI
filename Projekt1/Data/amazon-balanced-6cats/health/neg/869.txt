These CliC glasses are a great idea... I first saw them on CSI-NY, and sought them out, but they are not made big enough... they worked fine as long as I was looking down, but as soon as I turned my head level, or looking up, the glasses would "pop" apart.  I had purchased two pair, and returned them both
