I finally got this toothbrush after I have seen alot of people use them.  I am very disappointed.  The design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky.  It's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste.  It's very hard to clean.  It's loud, and small brush.  Not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive.  No thank you
