Bought two of these. One as a gift and one for myself. Luckily I tried mine out before I gave the other away. This thing just vibrates. NO MASSAGE AT ALL!! After 30 seconds you get nausea...its not worth 23.99...its a piece of junk. Trust me you are not getting a bargain. I guess you pay for what you get, but in this case I can't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub.
