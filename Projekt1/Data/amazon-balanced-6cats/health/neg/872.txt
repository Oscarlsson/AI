I bought this lamp because it says it doesnt give off any glare and is easy on the eyes for reading, doing crafts, sewing........... Well it doesnt giove off much light either!!!! So you need another source of light in your work area also......... I didnt think it would fill up the room with beautiful NATURAL light but c'mon.........all in all its an overpriced night light!!
