Cheezy as cheezy can be.   The only feature I liked was that this item could be returned!  The sound was terrible, not easy to tune, flimsy design and the gimmick to have it look like a bug was only cute if you are 10 years old.  This thing is junk and not worth the price of the batteries it requires.   Mine was promptly returned
