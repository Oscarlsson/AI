I thought these looked so cute when they came out, so I put it on my wishlist last year. From Day one, it has never worked right. Sometimes it just shuts off on it's own. Of course when you turn it back on you have to start at 88.9 again. There is no visible tuner, just a tiny hard button that hurts your finger when you press it. The antenna began getting rusty after a few months, finally this morning it broke off in my hand. I was able to stick it back in, but then wasn't able to tune a station. I turned it upside down and finally got something.

If you want hassle free, ease of use, and good quality, this is not for you.
