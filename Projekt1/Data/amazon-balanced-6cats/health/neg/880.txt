My girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday. He won't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on. We can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it. The main reason he quit listening is because after I spent time trying to set the station in the morning, during his shower the station would automatically change to another one, give me a break! This is a worthless radio, it doesn't even deserve 1 star
