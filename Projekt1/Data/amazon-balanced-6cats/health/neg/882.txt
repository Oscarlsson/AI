I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However, the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your success with the Reading Glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the Sports Goggles. I would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me!
