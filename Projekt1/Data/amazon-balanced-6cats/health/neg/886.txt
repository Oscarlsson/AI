I bought the goggles and was excited by the look. They are kind of "Riddick" like. They had disappoiinting performance when I rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face. They did float and so I found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened. I gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing. They definately are not for extreme sports. They are also too big for casual use as sun glasses.
