I lovelovelove dark chocolate, (and other strong, pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer) but these taste just plain wierd. It's not terrible, but I can taste the hoodia, sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate. I think they work at reducing hunger, but they give me gas so bad I can't be sure if I want to eat less because of the hoodia, or the gas. Maybe I'll try the *regular* ChocoLeans, but I won't be buying this again.

FYI: I absolutely LOVE the Phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix. I have no problems with that. Tastes great, works great. And no gas!
