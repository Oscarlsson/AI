I bought myself this book light after giving someone a $5 "robotic" book light from Walgreens. When she used hers it lit up the room. When I got mine today I tried it out and it barely lit up the palm of my hand. Had to smack it twice when the light flickered off to get it to come back on. It is flimsy, the light is dim and it's not worth the wait. Go to Walgreens instead. Mine is now lighting up the bottom of the trash can
