There are so many different sites that all tell you that 'they' have the best absorbed CoEnzyme Q10 manufactured.  It's hard to know who is really telling the absolute truth or just propagandizing a product for quick sale.  We are born with extremely high levels of CoEnzyme Q10 and then it gets slowly used up as the years pass even if we actually eat the foods that resupply our bodies.  And who purposefully eats these foods for the CoEnzyme Q10 content?  The mitochondria in every single cell in our body needs this coenzyme for production of energy.  By the time we are over 40, our levels have dropped significantly and our energy levels have dropped with it.  I must admit that this Nature's Made product does NOT seem to increase my energy level like other company's CoEnzyme Q10 does.  So, from my own reaction to this product, I do not recommend this particular CoEnzyme Q10.  There are several other companies that make excellent, effective products (like Dr. Whitaker's and Dr. Sinatra's and Dr. William's) but not this Nature Made product
