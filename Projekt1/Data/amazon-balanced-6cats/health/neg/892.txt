I purchased this product for my husband for Christmas. He has been in two car accidents and has migraines. We thought this might help. It doesn't. He feels very uncomfortable in fact. My mom has arthritis of the spine and she could not use it either. In fact, if you are short, as my mother and myself are, it doesn't do anything for you
