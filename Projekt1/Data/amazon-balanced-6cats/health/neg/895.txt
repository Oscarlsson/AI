Do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair? First, you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein. PROTEIN! Then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean, trim your ends, and not use heating appliances all the time! Lastly, drink water! That's the secret! You go on a hair care board and you'll find people who swear by Vivisical. They'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months! Don't believe that nonsense! If you buy Viviscal, you're a sucker! You're better off just taking a multi-vitamin
