I bought this based on Patricia's review and loved it for the first month, then noticed it making a strange sqeaking noise.  Upon closer inspection I noticed multiple welds breaking (I'm 185 lbs).  Now I'm not so happy with it, no warrenty, Amazon won't take it back.  Good thing I have a friend with a wire welder who can fix it for me
