I have heard fabulous things about gripe water from fellow mothers, but this particular brand is horrible.  The scent is strong, and the taste is strong and medicinal.  There are other gripe water brands out there that do not have such scent/taste.

Upon ingesting only 1 ml of this gripe water, my 7 week old daughter gagged repeatedly and vomited.  Up until then, she never vomited before.

If you want to try gripe water, find another brand
