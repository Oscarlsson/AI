Like the reviewer below, my dryer also stopped working within a short period. It was never dropped or misused -- after about a month, it simply refused to turn on when plugged in.
Now, there is a decent warranty for the product. However, with the money you spend on shipping and the $4 they request for handling/return shipping, buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal.

I don't know if the other reviewer and I got the only two lemons, but since we both found our way to Amazon with this review, I wouldn't recommend the product to other buyers
