This product would be excellent but runs fully 4" too narrow and 3" too short.  This creates an aprox. 2" lip around the entire matress. Very odd. This short coming disturbs the experience substantially. The laminated back works well. Be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine
