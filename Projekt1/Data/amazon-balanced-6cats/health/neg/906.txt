Every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight.  We returned it to Amazon, probably the first time we've ever had to do that.  For the price it should at least work.  Also, in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner.  It earns two stars for looking great.  I would not recommend it.
