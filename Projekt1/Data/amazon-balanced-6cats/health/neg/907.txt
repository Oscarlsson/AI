Everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles.  My original pair gave out after three years of use.  I ordered these because they said "standard size" they normally come in small medium and large.  WEll, I am medium and the standard size is large (same as my husbands).  I had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so I could wear them.  Did not have time to return....very disappointed.  Will consider this before ordering from you again.
