The description of the ingredients lists "d-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate" as the main ingredient.  However, the product bottle indicates that the actual main ingredient is "dl-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate", an articial and very different version of the advertised ingredient.  The Amazon.com listing is very misleading
