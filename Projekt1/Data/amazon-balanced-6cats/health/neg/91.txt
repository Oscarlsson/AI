Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have thought of that? I smell noble price here! 
Don't let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades. 
I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.
I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.
By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn't test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.
What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the "adding more blades" thing is getting exhausted.
