So, yeah, it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups, and once it's mounted, it stays put pretty well.  Unfortunately, it has so far never actually been "fogless."  Get a good shower going, and the mirror fogs up in record time.  Splash some water on it, and you can see yourself for half a minute, but overall, this is a disappointment.
