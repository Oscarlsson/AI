I originally planned to purchase Locin floss to replace the DenTek, but I'm not too pleased with it so far.

PLUSES
=======
-Each individually wrapped floss.
-Doesn't contain floride.

MINUSES
=======
-Flimpsy handle--almost not usable.
-Wrap is not 100% sealed.
-flossing head is shallower and narrower than the DenTek
