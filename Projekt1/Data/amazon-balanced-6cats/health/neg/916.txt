This is a very cheaply built product.  We had a hard time getting it to mist at all.  Even though the instruction say fill it with water at least 1 inch above the misting device it took trial and error to find the exact right level that it would mist at.  When it did mist it would not get more than about 1/3 inch from the top.  So, the mist never made it out of the bowl.  We did like the changing color lights
