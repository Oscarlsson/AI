Mercury contamination is a VERY big deal especially if you are going to take a product "for life", are pregnant or a child.
 
Many fish oil products have Mercury contamination and are NOT filtered. Is this product  Mercury free?? 

So far the only product that was certified Mercury free was available from my medical doctor by a prescription.
