1500 mgs etc... advertised, is misleading as 1500 mgs refer to the daily recommended dose contained in two pills. Honest advertising would quote 750 mgs etc... Per pill! I will definitively not purchase any product from that unreliable source. I believe Amazon should check it's suppliers with more scrutiny as their misconduct reflects on Amazon - a generally very reliable ecommerce site.
