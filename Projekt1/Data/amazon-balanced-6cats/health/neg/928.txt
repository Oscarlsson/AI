I will never purchase another Neutrogena product, again.  There products are dangerous!!!  It burned my face.  My face is all red, swollen, red, irritated, and itchy.  My new best friend is Cortizone 10, the anti itch cream.  It's been a week since I stopped using Netrogena, and I still look horrifying!!!!  Perfect for Halloween, right?  But, Halloween is over, and I still look scary.  This product has aged me!!!  It has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen.  NEVER, AGAIN, NEUTROGENA!!!
