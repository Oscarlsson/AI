I found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers. I was impressed and eager to try Tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them, I ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby. The diapers came sooner then expected, which was great. My single star rating comes from my experience using them. They have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit. It seems like no matter how tight I can get the diapers my son leaks through them, out the sides and up the belly. Because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week
