Please careful about this Grooming Kit. I bought one week before and when I turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work. This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge
