I bought this press to do crafts.  The dimensions I were given were completely wrong.  I was told the Product in Inches (L x W x H): 9.0 x 20.0 x 15.0  It really is barely 6 1/2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long, 17 inces long at the angle.   It was so small that I could maybe iron one sock at a time.  Also, the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and   Real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website
