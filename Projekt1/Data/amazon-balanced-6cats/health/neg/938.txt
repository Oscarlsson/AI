I like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper, so I bought Tushies.  When my baby was newborn, they seemed to work ok, maybe because she didn't put out that much.  She is now three months old.  I practice attachment parenting so I know exactly when she has a bowel movement.  The past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly.  She was sitting on my lap, she had a bowel movement, five seconds later I got up to change her, the feces was all over my pants.  This has happened several times.  The concept of the diaper is great, but the diaper needs some work around the legs
