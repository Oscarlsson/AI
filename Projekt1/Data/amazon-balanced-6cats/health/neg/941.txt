I recently bought 3 items from this brand - Lumiscope. Actually this is the only item that works among them. Though I am kind of suspicious about it's inconsistent readings from time to time. 

I think Braun IRT452 is a much better product, which I bought one for my parents in China. During SARS epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings.
