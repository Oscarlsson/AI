Maybe it's just my bad luck, but I ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery. I called Amazon, and they sent me a replacement quickly. The thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same *not working* condition. The same problem with the battery. I was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item, as Amazon vendor don't check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers. Be aware! Don't waste your time
