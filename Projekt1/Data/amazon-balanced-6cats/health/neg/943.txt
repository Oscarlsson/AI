Contrary to purported performance claims, my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of Duracell's products. Decades of experience with Everready Energizers - and with other Duracell products (e.g., Coppertops) - show ProCell products to be markedly inferior in performance.  Regardless of how long their shelf life may be, they simply haven't performed up to par, much less equally to other Alkaline batteries.

This has just been my experience - over daily use, over many months, with set after set of ProCell AA batteries.  Take it for what its' worth
