I've used the CardioChek 6 times, and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor's office during the same period.  My cholesterol levels according to the doctor's tests are always around 200.  With the CardioChek they vary by as much as 90 points.  It is a lot of trouble (and expensive) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, and Triglycerides.  No test strips are included in the package when I purchased the CardioChek.  The box says "includes check strips" but those are something other than test strips
