I bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips.
I simultaneously had bloodwork at the Doctor's office when I did the test.
Except for the total cholesterol, all the other tests were off.  The manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done.  Except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color.  The test strips which are expensive were bad. I am planning on returning this produc
