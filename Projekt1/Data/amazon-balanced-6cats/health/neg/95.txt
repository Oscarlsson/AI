like many other negative reviews, i've experienced the same problems with this razor.  i guess less blades is more and i'm going back to the m3 power.

i'll be brief about the problems:

1.  there's more "pulling" when you shave.  it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut.
2.  the razor is harder to clean off.
3.  i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn.
4.  it's more expensive than other better razors out there.

so there you have it.  if you HAVE to try it out, hey it might work for you.  but please, keep your receipt (and packaging) in case you want to get a refund.*

*  if you're reading this is 2009, chances are that gillette's money back guarantee will no longer be around.  however, there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then
