  Molly, daughter or Richard- I usually write positive reviews on this site but not this time. Why on earth do dermatologists recommend this s***? Last year my hormones were all out of wack and I had a period for a whole month. I broke out severely as one would expect. Dermatologists  (including mine) swear by this aweful chetaphil. I HATE IT! It wasnt strong enough for my skin. It made my acne even worse if you can imagine! I'd been using it for four months when I finally decided enough was enough and I started using Neutrogena Frangrance Free Facial Cleanser. That change made all the difference in the world! I still do have acne but now it is mild acne instead of severe acne. Now its mostly just old, light scarring and the occasional breakouts around my chin and lips the week before my period.  One of my friends is a dietition and she also has used Cetaphil and didnt like it at all. Please do not buy Cetaphil even if your dermatologist recommends it. You will totally regret it
