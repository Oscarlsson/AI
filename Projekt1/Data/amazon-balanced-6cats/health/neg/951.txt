I bought this for my husband and son and was not even able to give one hair cut.  It pulled the hair, and didn't cut well.  My husband kept complaining that it hurt and was pulling.  Since I couldn't finish, I had to use our old clippers to get the job done.  This was so disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for.
