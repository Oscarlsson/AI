I've been using TrimSpa X32 for over a year and, with a decent diet and regular excersise, I've lost over 40 pounds. The X32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no side effects at all. I, too, decided to use TrimSpa Energy because it was new and improved, but was sorely disappointed. The Engergy formula is way too high powered (200mg Caffeine per pill) for me and has made me feel "sped-up", sweaty, greasy and just plain gross. And that's taking under the suggested dosage. I'm sure that it will help drop the pounds for you...at the expense of dilated pupils, shaky hands and acting sketchy. I don't think this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings. I'm going back to the other formula tomorrow...that is if I can get to sleep!
