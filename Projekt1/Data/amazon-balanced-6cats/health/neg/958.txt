I bought this pricey little bottle of Lens Dr. hoping that it could extend the life of my expensive glasses but what a mistake! It did nothing but make it worse! After I saw what it did to the lenses, I had to scrape and scrub to get it off! I hope that no one else will waste their money on this worthless product. 

A BIG RIP OF
