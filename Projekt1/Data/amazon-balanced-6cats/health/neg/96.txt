Until I bought several weeks worth of Rayovac Alkaline D cells, I used Duracell Alkaline D cells.  

Every week I run a 3-CD changer (JVC _CX-XC370) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes, at the same volume level (Volume #10), from Tuesday to Thursday.  The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer).  In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last three weeks (maybe four weeks) have consistently  died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10).
