One-battery trimmers simply not strong enough, was glad to find a two-batteries version. It has a perfect design which will attract many more naive surfers like me. Unfortunately it's not good for nose hair trimming. Problem is it makes electric-like unpleasant sensations when touches sensitive skin inside nose.
So much that it makes you scared using it ;-) It also doesn't cut well, doesn't reach inside, makes burning smell and overheated. 

UPDATE On 2/7/2007:
 From my recent experience, the MicroTOUCH Turbo is an excellent alternative which has no problems mentioned above. The only problem is its durability (you may find yourself buying 2 per year) but at the price below $10 this is not a real issue. Good luck
