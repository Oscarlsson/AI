Please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with it.

I have used the Panasonic ES8043 for about 20 days now and it still tears my face to shreds every time I use it. 

Stay clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine, it's like French kissing jaws.  The worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you, you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi.. shaving will remove.

Seriously, this must be one of those devices left over from the Spanish inquisition.
