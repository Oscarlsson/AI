I bought this from QVC.  It will do the trick for quick touch-ups - not close hair removal, but close enough.  Unfortunately, mine is barley operating anymore, even with a fresh battery.  I'm not sure why the motor seems to be dying.  Maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long.  As a result, I think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well
