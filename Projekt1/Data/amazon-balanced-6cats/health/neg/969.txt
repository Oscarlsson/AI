I bought this from QVC after I had to send back a Braun Silk Epil. The epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness. Waxing just hurts too much and is really messy. This sounded ideal I just wanted to have a smoother look on my cheeks, and upper lip. It trims down your facial hair however, the next day you will notice stubble. You have to really look close to see it, but you can really feel it. You might as well shave. I have not used the brow attachment, I saw the demo on QVC but am afraid I will shave my brows off. Would love to know what others think of this item
