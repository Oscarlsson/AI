At Christmas 2003 I was very excited with the $50 scale my family purchased for me. It worked as advertised for about six months. Then it displayed the ERR message more and more. We replaced the battery. Then it would not permit any function buttons to perform. We just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $7 bathroom scale. When it went completely blank this week, battery of no use, I hopped on the internet to see what anyone else's experience is. To be fair, I will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right. I hope they can. If not, I will see what the Weight Watchers scales is like. Sigh ...
