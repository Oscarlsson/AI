After reading several comments I tried to proof my scale is working properly. However, like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant. I weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings. Like some one else I even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands. The scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight. Now! A digital scale is supposed to be percise..
