First of all, the battery that was supposed to be enclosed was not. When I bought a 9 volt battery and installed it, it would not stay attached when putting it back in the battery compartment. Finally, I got a read out, and entered my height and age. Then I stood on the scale and got nothing - no weight, no body fat, nothing, but the word ERROR, at which point I boxed it up and sent it back for a refund
