I had this for about 2 years, and was not impressed.  It worked for a month or so, and since then, does nothing.  If you fill it up with water, and then plug it in for several days, the water level never goes down.  I've tried cleaning it repeatedly, and tried various things to make it work, but apparently it's just dead.  It was a cheap product; you get what you pay for
