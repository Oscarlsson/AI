I just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition.  However, after setting it up, I added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water.  No cascading sound.  I added more water -- nothing... I added less water -- absolutely nothing.  The design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise.  It is useless from that perspective... plus, you can tell it is made of plastic so it isn't really that nice to look at either.  I would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use
