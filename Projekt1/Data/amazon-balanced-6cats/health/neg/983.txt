This item is very heavy and bulky.  Descriptions give you the idea that your feet will endure the "kneading" action as well as your calves; however that is not the case.  Your feet only rest on these two painful round balls that only vibrate should you wish them too.  The "kneading" pressure can not be regulated, only the speed.  The "kneading" pressure is VERY intense and can be very uncomfortable at times.  If my massage therapist ever worked like this I would fire immediately.  I tired to like it, however quickly returned after a few days
