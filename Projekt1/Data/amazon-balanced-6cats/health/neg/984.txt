If you get it wet it stops working, which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush. If you want something to work for a month or two its fine, otherwise avoid it entirely. I intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture, pretty quickly after ordinary use
