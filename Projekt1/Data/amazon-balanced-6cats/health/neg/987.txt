It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop.  I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again.  Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together.  Very frustrating.  Go get a professional dryer.  it might cost a bit more but it'll work!  And probably for a long time
