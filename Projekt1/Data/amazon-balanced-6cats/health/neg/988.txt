I loved ths retractable cord hair dryer when I first bought it about a year ago.  Now it's starting to stop running.  It appears to be a short in the power cord in the inclosed casing.  When I'm using it...it works then it stops, then I shake it and then it starts to work again, sometimes.  My last hair dryer lasted over 20 years.  They just don't make products like they use to. For this price I shouldn't expect much.   I guess you really do get what you pay for!  This hair dryer is perfect to take on an airline.   If it's not allowed on the plane and they throw it out,......who cares
