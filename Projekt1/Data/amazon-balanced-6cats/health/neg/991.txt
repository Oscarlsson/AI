Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference
