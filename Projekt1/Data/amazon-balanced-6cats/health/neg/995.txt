I bought this scale as an upgrade from a Wal Mart cheapo scale.  Hated it!!  I should have read the dimensions more carefully, but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom.  Worse still, it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first.  Had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again.  Returned the item, but ate the $11 return ship fee  - it's huge AND heavy
