Did not work at all. I used cheaper products that I bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them.
Since Princereigns promised to be a miracle product, I bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them. Complete waste of money
