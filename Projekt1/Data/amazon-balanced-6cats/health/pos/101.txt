I eat one of these twice a week before I play ice hockey.  I specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine, though I don't perceive any "boost".  It could be there and I'm just not noticing it.  I feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout.  It would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the Clif Bar.
I find the size of a Clif bar a bit disappointing, especially considering the "store" price of $1.50.  At $11 a case and with free shipping when spending $25 or more, I've not found a better price than Amazon's on Clif bars
