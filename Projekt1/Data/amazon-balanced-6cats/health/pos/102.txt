I have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down.  As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base.  It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess.  You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it's very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush.  Highly recommende
