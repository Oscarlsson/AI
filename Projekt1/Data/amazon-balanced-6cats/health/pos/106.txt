I really liked the outside design of the book. A lot of books were "cartoonish" and really was drawn to the look of the book. I wish the book did not have so much random fill-in pages. I had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events/ages of the child. But all in all I am pleased with it. I would most likely buy again
