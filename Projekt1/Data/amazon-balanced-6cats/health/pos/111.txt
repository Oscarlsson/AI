I own an older dispensor, from around 1999, and I was afraid that these filters wouldn't fit.  They do and seem to work fine.  I can't find a "replace" indicator on these new ones, the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them.  I guess that I just have to replace it on a calendar basis, they say the filters are good for 2 months
