I was very suprised at how small the units were (I ordered 2).  But they work great and run very quietly.  The filter is very easy to change.  I have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that I switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money
