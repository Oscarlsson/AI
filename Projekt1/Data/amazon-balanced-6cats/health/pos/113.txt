I called Nature Made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury. Their Fish oil is USP tested for purity and potency. There isn't any "mercury-free" fish oil, however, NM contains only .01 mcg / g of mercury. Very low level and certainly not toxic. I'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently. FYI: they have a great website that contains all this information
