Bought this to help make muddy paw print clean up a little quicker.  This works well, my better half thinks I have an obsession with Mr. Swiffer... :) It does leave a haze on the floor though.  I use the recommended 3 sec. cleaner dispense...maybe it's because I don't change the pads ofter enough.  Overall, I would purchase the Swiffer again if I had too
