I suffer from upper back and shoulder tension.  I've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one I had.  After looking at many warmers, I chose the Happy Wrap.  The wrap stays warm for more than an hour and has the moist heat which is perfect for tense muscles.  My Yorkshire Terrier can't wait until I'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when I'm finished.
