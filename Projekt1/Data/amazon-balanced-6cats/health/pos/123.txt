I really like this product because it's compact and easy to use. Now that wouldn't be important if it didn't work properly, but it does, so I have everything in one small, easy-to-carry package.  That's a valuable feature for one who's on the go as much as I am.

The greatest thing about this product is that it's ACCURATE; I always take it to the Dr's office with me and compare his results with the results of this dynamite little monitor.

I liked it so well, after I tried it, I went back and bought one for a friend who was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure.

Highly recommended, but I also recommend that you compare your results with your doctor's.  After all, it's only a machine ... and like cars, you can always get a "lemon.
