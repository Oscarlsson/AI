My grandfather found a vial of Old Spice in his Navy kit when he joined in 1943. He continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age. I began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious: Old Spice is conservative and masculine, distinct and time-honored. It's not a trend; it's a statement of manhood. If Proctor &amp; Gamble obliges, my own grandkids will be using it
