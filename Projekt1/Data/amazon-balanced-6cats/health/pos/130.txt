I rate (Green tea Fat Burner) 5 star. because 

I bot another called Lipoxinol 70.00) and I bot another one called   (Green tea fat furner) and it was better in quality wise and its only 14.99 at Costco.
Lipoxinol is very good as well but more expesive . bot off amazon.it sais its ( made canada) derctions say to take 4 pills in AM & 4pills  PM. and man there great.
the (green tea fat burners)  in comparison dictions say take 2 pillsAM & 2pills PM. I over rall I think  (green tea fat burner) makes me a little bit more hyper. the more hyper the more stuff I do ,that means the more excerise I get,,,,, 
 You will see Lipoxinal on amazon. its 4 star, this one has less rating for some reason ,not many people said much about it, wierd ,Americans like to pay more money when ,this one can work just as great, not all work tho, but like I said this one was great for me in wise, I bot both,dont go off telling every one u are taking weight loss pills because people will get worryed, like theres no problem ,people drink Coffee every day of there life, I told my mom and she thot I was crazy, but what dose my mom know, she never tryed weight loss pills, I tryed ntoher one from the natral food store call Mini skiny fat burner and I felt like I just shot my self with cocane, so be carfull ,earbs have been used for thousand of years and can make u drug crazy,
