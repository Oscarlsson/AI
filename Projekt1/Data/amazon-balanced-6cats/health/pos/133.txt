27 ounces is a nice size, the bottle is light (can be dented), and water stored in it tastes very good....and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy!
Another reviewer mentioned a squeal......that would be while twisting the cap on or off. I've gotten used to that. Wish it was just a hair thinner to fit in my Toyota cupholder...that may not be an issue with Toyotas that are newer than mine are (10 & 15years).
In the car, on the nightstand ,in the canoe or kayak.....it's working for me
