I purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters.  It's a great brush head for pediatric (and adult) mouths. They swap out the heads, it's rechargeable and I can stop purchasing junky kids battery-operated toothbrushes every 1-2 months after the batteries wear down.  I have used this toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a problem with receding gums or plaque build-up
