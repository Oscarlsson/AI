I used to own a brush from another manufacturer.  It never brushed well: the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly.  I just never felt I was getting a good brush.

After using this brush for about a couple of months, I went in for a regular checkup.  My dentist told me my teeth had never looked better.  That's all the testimony I need
