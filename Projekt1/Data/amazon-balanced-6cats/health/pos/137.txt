I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model.  The kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth.  It's a bit louder than the older model, probably because it's got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light.

Overall, just what we wanted
