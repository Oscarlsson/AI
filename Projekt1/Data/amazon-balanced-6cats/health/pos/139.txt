I was skeptical about buying this at first, but after seeing it in Allure, and reading the various reviews on amazon, I decided to try it.
I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised; it does what it says. It won't work on cyctic acne or if the pimple has already come to a head. It does work on pimples that are just beginning.. those hard, tender knots deep under your skin you just know are going to be huge in a day or two. I've used it on two pimples that were red bumps, and both were mostly gone within 24 hours. Completely gone in less than 3 days. Usually it would have taken 7-10 days for them to go away, and it would have been UGLY
