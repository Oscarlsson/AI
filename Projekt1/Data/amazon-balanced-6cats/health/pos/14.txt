I just finished a 4 day golf tournament that was brutal. 6 hour rounds played in 90 degree heat with high humidity. During a practice round a couple of days before the tournament started I really got drained of energy after about 12 holes. I was unprepared and it made a sport that I normally enjoy into an unpleasant experience.

For the tournament rounds I packed a small cooler with Gatorade, Nature Valley Fruit and Nut bars, and chocolate flavored Clif Builder's bars. I drank water and gatorade throughout each round and alternated the bars every 3-4 holes. It really made a difference. Each day I felt like I had the energy and endurance for a great round. If only my golf game was as good as these bars.

They tasted great and keeping them in a cooler kept them from melting in the heat. I highly recommend Chocolate Clif Builder's bars.
