The lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans from aquis are very soft, absorbant, and they dry quickly. The "diva darling" hair towels are not quite as nice.

Hair turbans stay neatly on your head and are more convenient than a big fluffy towel. If the turban gets sopping wet, that means it's doing its job! 

My parents taught me it's impolite to come to breakfast without a towel covering my wet hair. This turban is not only great at home, but also in college dorms.
