I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels great.  I personally like the COPPER version a little better than the SILVER version.  It's a little gentler and softer but I know some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are fragil and I would risk damaging them.  It also feels really good on the back and actually all over, not just on the head
