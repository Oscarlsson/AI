These bars are absolutely fantastic. They are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein (20g). They taste pretty good, far better than most bars. I prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor. Out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream, next being the peanut butter, and then chocolate. A chocolate mint flavor has just been released but I have yet to try it. I recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out
