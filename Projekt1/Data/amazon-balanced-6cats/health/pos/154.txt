This replaced a similar wrist cuff meter which I was not happy with.  The old meter would give very different readings on measurements made minutes apart.  This meter yields essentially the same numbers for second measurements.  Out of curiosity, I took it with me to my doctors office, used his large cuff (I have very large arms) and compared the readings to his equipment.  Total difference was about 3%, a quite acceptable tolerance for my home measurement.  Another reviewer was unhappy with the screen size and position on the bottom of the wrist.  If the unit is operated as shown in the instructions, the screen size and position are perfect, the unit is at heart level, and is quite easy to read.

Overall, for home use and serious data collection and blood pressure monitoring, I like this device
