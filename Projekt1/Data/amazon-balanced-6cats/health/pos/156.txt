I saw these here and ordered two pair to get the free shipping deal.  I should get a deal where I get a cut of the customers I send them because EVERY day I have my customers (several each day) ask me what's going on with my glasses and where did I get them.

I used to go through several pair of reading glasses a month.  Now I have had these two pair for ...gosh, It's got to be close to a year now!  They don't scratch, break, get lost, they're always right there.  I don't know how I did with out them for so long.

Get a couple of pairs you'll love them.  Oh, one thing when the ladies try them on thier hair doesn't always set right with the wrap around thingy.  But I don't know that this can't be overcome....so...something to consider
