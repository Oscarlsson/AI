Just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived MELTED as noted by another reviewer. I ended up placing in the fridge, and then taking out before eating. Turns out, I didn't find them that great directly from the fridge. Also, they just didn't taste as fresh as the ones I buy individually from Wal-Mart. I couldn't tell if that was because they had melted, or just weren't as fresh to start with
