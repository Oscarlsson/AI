This simple scale is light, easy to carry and store.

I tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my older dial scale. It read the same weight, but actually with less flucuation when I shifted on it. I was careful to keep it on a flat surface... I had good luck on old hardwood floors, less luck on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom.

It was very consistent on a level surface... I tested it several times in a row with the same reading, and various times throughout the day... nothing read unusually.

I really like the form factor of this scale. It's so small... Not small spacewise, but just thin, light, with a nice solid place to plant your feet
