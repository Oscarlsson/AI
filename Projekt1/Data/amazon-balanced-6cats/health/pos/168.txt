For two years I suffered with four herniated discs.   Physical therapy, a spinal injection , chiropractic adjustments, and many sessions on a spinal decompression machine provided short term relief.  I started using the McKenzie Method extension exercises, and this offered the most relief.  Fortunately, I finally discovered the Lumbar Extender in an internet ad.  I noticed that it placed the spine in a similar position as the McKenzie exercises.  So, I decided to order the Lumbar Extender to determine if it would provide better relief than all the other methods I was using.  

The first two weeks that I used the Lumbar Extender, I had some minor discomfort.  Now after five weeks using the Lumbar Extender, I can honestly say that my back has not felt better in two years.  This device does all that it says it will do.  I actually enjoy lying on it for two seven-minute sessions each day-one session in the morning and one session at night.  

When I first used the device, I heard snapping noises in my lower back, probably the spinal facets being repositioned, and then I would experience immediate relief.  Now I feel as if I have better posture and better curvature to my lumbar region.  The cost of the Lumbar Extender is low compared to a visit to a doctor, and it is worth trying.  I highly recommend it
