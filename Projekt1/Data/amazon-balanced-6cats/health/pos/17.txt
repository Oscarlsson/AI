I originally ordered a Tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks.  (Amazon, of course, took it back with no problems.)  I was so glad when the Omron scale arrived.  It costs less than the Tanita but the quality is much higher.  The numbers on it are very large and easy to read.  Also, it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the Tanita.  I can't wait to try all the features.  By the way, I weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs. as promised.  Great deal for the money!!!
