It seems like this is NOT 3x concentration, and like others we found we had to compensate by adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same results as we did with the standard formula. Otherwise, the two products, 'concentrated' and 'standard srength' are the same. 

MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT - THIS IS CONCENTRATED & COMES OUT LIKE HEINZ KETCHUP:

It does seem to be concentrated, and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle, kind of reminded us of Heinz ketchup.

4-STAR or 5-STAR PRODUCT? 

The standard strength product is clearly a 5-STAR product, however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim, it rates 4-STARs with our family. 


TRYING TO LEARN OBJECTIVE INFO ON LAUNDRY DETERGENT IS WELL . . . . 

THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE OF THIS PRODUCT IN STANDARD STRENGTH or 3X WITH EXTRA DETERGENT ADDED: 

I am allergic to most laundry detergents, but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years. It is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available. In addition to being very easy on clothes and skin, it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak. This is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens. It is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this, you may have to pre-soak stains and you won't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it. While "Tide" and "Cheer" are also available in hypoallergenic formulas,["Tide Free" is actually just unscented] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience. That's why I like this "All Liquid Detergent - Free Clear, Laundry Detergent". 

OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS TOUGH TO FIND! 

I actually did conduct a hard target search for true, objective information on laundry detergents. There is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which, while important, is not what I was trying to find. "Consumer Reports" does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail. 

ABOUT "ALL'S WEBSITE" 

If you are looking for this product's website it is under "Unilever" and you will have to specify "USA" under products, as the word "ALL" will show up in almost every search result. You will find "WISK" and "BREYER'S ICE CREAM" and almost as many neat name brand products as you would at Procter and Gamble's site.
