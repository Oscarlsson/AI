I was 5 minutes early getting out of the house to go to work one morning so I decided I could stop by a coffee shop and get a mocha. On my way back to my car the mocha "splooshed" out of the sipping hole in the to-go lid and got all over my sweater...naturally, that day it was a white silk knit sweater. So I had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains, and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely late to work by going home to change.

The cafe was next to a supermarket so I decided to go buy a Tide to Go pen and give it a try. I applied it as directed to the stain and immediately the stain lightened noticeably. I was a bit worried because after treatment there were still light tan stains visible, but after blotting the excess liquid and letting the sweater dry while wearing for about half an hour, there was no hint that any mocha had ever touched my sweater.

The cleansing agent also gets points for not damaging my silk sweater, despite the fact I was rubbing the product in fairly vigorously (out of desperation...I was going to be late for work!)

I'm not sure how it would work on other stains but I will keep one in my purse from now on. On the packaging it does identify which sorts of stains it works best on, and which it will be less effective on. From other reviews this will not work so well on some common food stains, so that's why I'm giving 4 stars and not 5.

Another minor concern is the warning about blotting the fluid if fabric will come into contact with direct sunlight. It doesn't say what will happen if you allow saturated fabric to see sunlight. Perhaps there is the potential for color/fabric damage
