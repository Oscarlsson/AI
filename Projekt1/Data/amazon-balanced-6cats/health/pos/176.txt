I boutght this razor for my husband.  He likes it, but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers, which he seems to miss a lot.  I think that if he shaved more carefully, he would get these whiskers before they get too long!  I think that for the price (lower end of price range), it does a pretty good job.  Next time, I'll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better.
