This is a great iron for a starter, but will not do it like a stylist. I have had it for at least 2 years so it will last also. The price is a little bit to high I only paid $ 19.99 for it at Walmart.I know everyone has gotten used to shopping online because it is eay and always open, but I have to tell you that most of the things I have found on amazon are priced way to high. They used to be a great spot to get good stuff cheap but that is no longer true. I think it just kind of creeped up on us without us noticing what was going on. Please folks go back out in to the world and start looking you will see that I am not wrong
