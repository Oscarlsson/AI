I have not try Proactive. The thought of buying something from an infomercial just doesn't sit well with me.  I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till now (I'm 35). I spent thousands of dollars on expense department store's brands like Clarins, Seshiedo, Dior, Clinics, Chanel, and Prescriptives. I've also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials, extractions, and chemical peels.  I tried perscription cream, oitments, pads, you name it (even thought of laser).  I have mild acne problem year round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month (that's when I'd run out and try new products).

Three days ago I bought the Zeno.  I'm going to return it.  It did nothing to me accept thought it would burn me.  I also bought AcneFree and today I went back and bought another package to put in my gym bag.  Three days now, I've noticed my skin cleared up! I'm amazed.  I'm not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared.  I'll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve.  So far AcneFree works for me
