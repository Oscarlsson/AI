Great product, the girls had a blast with it.  Real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair.  Great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled!  Although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair.  Not all the time though.  Still a fabulous product.  Would highly recommend it.  My niece wishes it came with more gems
