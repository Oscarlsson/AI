These items are neat little towelettes that come in their own attractive and useful plastic container. They are very handy, and work wonders for insuring cleanliness. Personally, I sure wish I had had these when my first two children were small.

On the down side, flushing these things *can* result in plumbing problems, as I experienced. Apparently, if your sewer line is relatively new and clear, they should give you no problems. But, if your system has any place in it where things can collect, you will face problems. According to my plumber, toilet paper begins to break down quite quickly, but these towelettes can take over a month to do so. (My house was built in 1916!)

So, overall, I do like this product, and I recommend it. I just recommend that if you live in an older house, that you do not flush them
