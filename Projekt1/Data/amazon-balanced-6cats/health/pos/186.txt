My hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing/smoothing products -- they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth. My hair is very fine, but also thick (which is very annoying). This finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down. It seems very expensive for such a small bottle, but a little goes a long way (I've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it's still not finished). Definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all. The scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming.
