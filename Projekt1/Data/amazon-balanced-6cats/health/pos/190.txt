i tried all the possible creams on the market, cheap and expensive, for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately. i cannot live without it, this is a keeper. it stings a little bit, not all the time but it does. it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i've had a really tiring week and i'm in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day, just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them. i guarantee that in three days you'll not recognize yourself(in a good way). very important: it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream( i use pure chamomile cream)and leave it over night. well, follow my recipe and you'll shine fast, you'll see
