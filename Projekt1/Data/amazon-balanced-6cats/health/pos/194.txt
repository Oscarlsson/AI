These are by far the BEST newborn size diapers especially for small babies, but if you order them through Amazon, your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive!  I waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1, which Actually arrived in a few days!

Update: I have ordered Pampers again through Amazon (different size) and they shipped right away
