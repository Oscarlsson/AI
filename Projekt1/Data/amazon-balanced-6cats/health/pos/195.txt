I lost six pounds in eleven days.  I started out taking one-half pill in the morning and one-half in the afternoon.  I was wary of any reaction.  I now take one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon.  That's enough for me.  I have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise.  No side effects whatsoever.  My problem was the munchies at night watching TV -- and that craving is gone.  I highly recommend this product
