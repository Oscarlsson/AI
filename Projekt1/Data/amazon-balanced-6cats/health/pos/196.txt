Read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child's nusery. I absolutely love it. Before this, my son could not sleep well with our "family's" humiifier because it was too noisy. Within an hour of bringing this home, it was set up (very easily) and he took one of many 2 1/2 hour naps that week! No filters, No noise, NO PROBLEMS thus far! I did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath, but the humidifier was near a window, and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top. (The problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop) Filling it is a snap and the very fine mist (looked like small stream of fog) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal! The tank seems to last longer than the box states. It is on it's third day on a low/med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top. I love the safety features and I don't have to worry about the tank still on if it's empty since it has an automatic shut off! The light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room. It is a design that will last thoughout his childhood! Thank you Crane!
