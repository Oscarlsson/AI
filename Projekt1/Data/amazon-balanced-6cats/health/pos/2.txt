I've been using the Omron HBF-306 Body Fat Analyzer for a month or so now. So far I've been very impressed with its consistency. However, I would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the Omron's measurements to see how accurate it is. It's well built and very easy to use. Once you set up your profile, it only takes a few seconds to get a read. I would give it 5 stars but again I dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with. Still a good product at a good price.
