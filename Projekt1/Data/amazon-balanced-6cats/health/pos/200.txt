It takes some getting used to, but once you do you will love it.  It leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush, electric or other, that I have ever used.  You feel at first like it is totally strange (it is!).  Doesn't take more than a few times using it to realize that it's a great concept and so much faster than anything else.

I have no buyers remorse.  I Just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person.  You really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle
