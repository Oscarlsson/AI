I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it. She is able to do her nail easily.  The nail attachments work really well and strong, the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so, but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone.Compact size, easy to store and quick charge time
