I bought this razor over a year ago, and I wouldn't trade it in for any other razor out there. It really does leave your skin super smooth. I love the triple blades on it so I know I can get a close, comfortable shave, even in hard to reach places. Thanks to the pivoting head, it moves with the curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut. It's also excellent for shaving the underarm area. I find that one stroke is all it takes, and you have a smooth appearance you have to feel and see to believe. This is truly a remarkable product for the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day, or more than three times a week. With this razor, it shaves so close to the hair follicle, you will be shaving in less time, less often. I will never part with my Venus razor. The best part is - it's a bargain for what you get!
