Best hair dryer ever. I have long, thick, curly, frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the Conair 213X, my hair is shiny and soft. The diffuser is also amazing; I can wear my hair naturally without any frizz. 

By far the best dryer out there in this price range. Granted, it's heavy, but it cuts my drying time in half and I don't have to style after drying which is another plus! It has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the Rhinestones?
