Oral B has always been top notch for me and this 8900 DLX is just fantastic.

My teeth are so bad the Dentist always called me the plaque king  lol
but after 6 months on this I went to the next cleaning and they saw a huge improvement.

He calls me by my name now thanks to this product haha 

I have been putting this thing to the test for about a year now and I love it...I keep it on the spinning setting which really works well.

do remember that if you turn it on without it in your mouth, you spray water everywhere and the spin setting really makes a fine mist with some power but its still a top notch product.

thanks Oral B!!
