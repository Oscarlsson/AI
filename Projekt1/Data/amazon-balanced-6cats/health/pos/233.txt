I bought this for my aged Mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel I'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle.  She *adores* the microfiber towels I got her!  They are light for her weak arms, they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly.  Not to mention that I, a hearty creature in my prime, love these towels too! I shall be buying more of various styles and colors
