I got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend.  High blood pressure runs in my family so I wanted to get a monitor to keep track.  I was figuring on getting an arm unit, but when I got this wrist unit I wanted to see how it would work.  The whole system is very easy to use and fast.  You need to be sitting and resting to take the reading, but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you.  I didn't think I would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy.  I can say this was a great gift, something I use a lot, and something that will help me stay healthy
