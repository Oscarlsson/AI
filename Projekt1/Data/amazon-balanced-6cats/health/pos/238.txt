I used to have some Remington shaver that a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs.  It wasn't bad, but sometimes it irritated the skin.  my first shaver was my dad's old school norelco shaver so i thought i'd give them a try again.  the first one i got from amazon was $40 (i forgot the model #) and ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee.  it was just alright.  this one i feel about the same way.  i mean it shaves decently, but as an asian male with not much facial hair, i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to.  the cleaning system is cool, and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean (it says you can open it up and run it under water which i've been doing to clean it) make it worthwhile to me though.  the battery life is also good.  if there was a half star system, i'd give this shaver a 4.5/5
