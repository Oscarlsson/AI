I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and clean I have only had to charge it once so far. Even though this is my first electric shaver, it is a good deal for the money. It doesn't shave as close as a razor but it's close. I would recommend it or give it as a gift.
