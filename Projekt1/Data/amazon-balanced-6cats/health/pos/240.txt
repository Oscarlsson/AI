My husband is in love with this razor!  He thought he was a Norelco-only fan, until I bought him this model for Christmas.  I purchased it due to the great reviews it received, both from consumers and independent reviewers, and also b/c it cost less than $40.  It leaves his face so smooth, whether he shaves daily or skips a couple of days.  In fact, he can finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor burn.  Highly recommended
