My wife and I both love this. In our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable "head trip" than the trippers one might find in the mall. The vibrations make it better than the non-vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming.

Another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations. 

It's a pretty simple device, sold at a reasonable cost, and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones
