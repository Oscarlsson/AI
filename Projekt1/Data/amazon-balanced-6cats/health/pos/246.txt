Very good; very satisfying.  Interesting blend of flavors--dried fruit, cocoa, chili.  Nothing dominates - all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat.  I couldn't eat one every day, but for an occasional meal replacement, it is very good.  Too high calorie to be a snack item, but it's tempting
