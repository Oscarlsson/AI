As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models.  The slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy.  Just 2 noticable disappointments:

1.  The external power supply is a rather combersome change from former Norelco products.

2.  The exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome "feature" of an otherwise good product at a premium price
