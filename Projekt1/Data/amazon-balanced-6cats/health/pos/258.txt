I purchased this for my husband as a gift without ever having smelled it.  I based my purchase on other reviews, and the fact that I have the Burberry classic for women and love it.  I crossed my fingers and hoped that the reviews were right.  Well, they were!  When this came in I could not resist; I had to open the box.  I pulled the outer wrapping back, carefully pulled the box out (I was able to replace all this without hubby knowing), sprayed some into the air, and "ahhhh", wonderful!  I loved it!

It smells wonderful on my husband, too.  It's kind of woodsy, but not overpowering at all.  It's a classic, warm fragrance, and it lasts a long time. I will definitely buy this again
