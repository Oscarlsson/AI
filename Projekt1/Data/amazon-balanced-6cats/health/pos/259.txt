Clean and Crisp. Defined and Smooth.
I use Burberry by Burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening. IT has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn.
I am very picky about my fragrances and I only use two regularly -- Eau d'Issey by Issey Miyake is my main scent, but I do use Burberry sometimes on occassion and I love it. Thats it
