This toilet paper will never feel like the cozy stuff that blocks the toilet on a regular basis, but it is a product that feels somewhat better than varieties you find in many public toilets. I am willing to compromise a tiny bit of plush, and save all the hours spent attached to toilet plungers. I do concern myself with any chemicals that are placed into a product that makes it "rapid-dissolve", and will in time, try an environmentaly friendly brand. A great option for family with kids who know no limits for toilet paper usage, and ignore the presence of a plunger
