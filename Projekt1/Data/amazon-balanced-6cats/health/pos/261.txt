If you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper, then this is the brand and variant you should switch to. 

If I were to objectively judge it by what it promises (rapidly dissolves...), I'd have to give it five stars. It practically melts as soon as it touches water. Don't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink; you'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue.

I'm giving it only four stars, because it's not my favorite toilet paper (that would be Charmin Ultra), but the necessary choice.
