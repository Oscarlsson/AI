Having tried most all Energy drinks, I can honestly say this one is different. Guru picks me up gradually yet does not drop me down as though my wings have been clipped. One at noon and I'm good to go for the rest of the day. Plus, I don't go home and kick the dog!
The taste is not Sugary and at about $1.40 a can (Free Shipping) the price speaks for itself
