I was reluctant to buy this after reading that it wasn't so great on fine hair, but my son's hair was really getting shaggy and I was *NOT* going to wrestle with him at the barber shop again. So I bought this and was so happy when it worked perfectly on his hair. I used the 1 inch guide for his whole head and he looks great! The vacuum got all the hair which is a good thing, because I cut his hair wherever he happen to be in the house. He didn't have to stop what he was doing and sit still or wear a cape, which he hates. 

Having his hair cut at home also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer--what it sounds like, and feel like-- in his own time and environment. He cut his stuffed bear's hair first, then daddy's, then his own by himself and then let me cut his. What a relief to have a nice haircut and no kicking or screaming. 

At $25, it has already paid for itself. I'm so glad I bought it. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it is pretty loud and  had a really crappy users manual.
