Bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and I used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there, no hair on him or pillows or sheets.  This is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair, I also used it on the tougher part of his beard.  Wonderful item
