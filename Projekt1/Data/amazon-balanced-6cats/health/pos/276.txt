This unit has the power transformer at the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part. The handheld part is mostly made of plastic. So, it's pleasantly light to hold, much lighter than my Wahl homecare thing.

The supplied guard things (that you swap to change length, etc.; IIRC they range from 1/8" to 1") have a curve on the bottom so it's easier to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the pointed end into them. This also makes things more pleasant.

Don't believe the no-mess story, though. It really does catch most of the hair, so it's certainly worthwhile, and it's easy to empty the hair trap, but I still have to vacuum the remainder afterwards. It doesn't catch it all
