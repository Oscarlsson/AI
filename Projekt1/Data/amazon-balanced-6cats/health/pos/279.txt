I bought this product because I had one from years ago that I use when I go to the gym but lost.  It's great at drying me off while i'm working out and yet the towel isn't wet.  I am conflicted though.  I bought this one when I lost the one I already had.  It's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original, but I still like it for what it does.  I also like the little bag that it comes in, which I didn't have with the original one
