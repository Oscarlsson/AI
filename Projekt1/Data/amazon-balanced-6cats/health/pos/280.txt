After looking into several reviews on blow dryers, I learned about the Revlon Tourmaline.  All of the reviews were so positive.  I've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are.  The placement couldn't be better on the controls. The price was right as well!  Blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive.  A very good value
