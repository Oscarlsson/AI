Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer.  No frizz, quick drying results.  The diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air. The dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job.  The motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use.  Don't waste your money on the expensive ones
