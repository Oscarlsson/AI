I bought this item last month from Amazon.com for $149. I thought it is using some kind of hand-like massage motors, and not those vibration motors. When the item arrived and I setup, I found out they are using the vibration motors! A little disappointed I am. But I use it, it is not bad if you don't mind the vibration motors. The heat feature is great. However, the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting position isn't holding well. The leather-like material really feels like a lether. The vibration really vibrates the whole floor, so I suggest to put on carpetted areas only. I personally like the hand-like massage chair better. But this $149 chair is worth the price. Others would sell for over $300
