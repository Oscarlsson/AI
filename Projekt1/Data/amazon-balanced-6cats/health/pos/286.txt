This model was given to me as a gift almost two years ago.  I bought another off of Amazon because the recharge cord had a short in it, and I figured I could use a second one to keep in my travel bag.  I'd have to say I'm pretty pleased with the trimmer.  I like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when I want to change the trimming depth.  I use it a few times a week, and it seems that it can go for months without needing a charge.  The little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into the little holding area is not the strongest....It's catches probably 70% of what I trim.  You'll want to be sure you're standing over a sink or towel when using it.  Well worth the $30 I spent for this grooming tool
