This was the first brand of nursing pads I tried.  My first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy.  Yet after trying several brands of nursing pads, I came back to Lansinoh.  They are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after I had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable. The best deal I have found has been amazon's price for 3 boxes.
