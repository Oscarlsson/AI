It is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer. It does its job pretty nicely. The dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world. A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding handle and light weight. The disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage. It is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment
