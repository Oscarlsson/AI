These little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums.  Flossing with traditional floss hurt because I always cut myself and deeply.  It probably saved me from serious gum disease, and that I understand is expensive to treat, so I'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy
