I had bought a Tingler elsewhere for $20, plus shipping, so when I saw this one advertised for $9, I was a bit hesitant that it wasn't the real Tingler, but a cheap knock-off (especially since they show no picture). BUT, I decided to risk it and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is not only the real Tingler, it is also shipped in a pretty velvet pouch for wonderful gift-giving. Amazon, of course, also offers free shipping for $25 or more, so I bought 3 and got them all shipped free! Great deal! And, by the way, it IS incredible! It really did send little shivers down my spine the first few times I used it. While you sort of get used to the feeling after a while and the little shivers may disappear, it still feels fabulous on your head
