Like the razor - I have problems with ingrown hairs on my neck and this shaver has helped to alleviate the problem - the Nivea lotion is very soothing.  I have had to live with the fact that the shave on my neck is not the closest in the world but c'eat la vie.  I have taken to running a couple of passses dry to get a fairly close shave and then starting to apply the lotion as I continue.  If you start with the lotion you won't get a close shave.  I do wonder if one couldn't simply buy a shaver ad apply some lotion at the end for the same affect
