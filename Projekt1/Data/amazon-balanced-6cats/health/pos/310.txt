... I purchased this item to remove some debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very nicely.

The microfiber texture feels nice - a little beady, but soft and textured.

Using it was easy, I just wiped the lens in a circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris was gone. (some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch but wasn't)

The packaging is a little subpar though. It comes in a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the cloth out. However doing so leaves adhesive residue, which the cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off, making those sections of the cloth appear phyically different - a bit roughed up I'd say. This is poor design as the packaging says to store the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination, so I used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the adhesive residue off.

I've yet to machine wash it, but so far it works well. It's just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after all
