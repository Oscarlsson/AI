This is the second Aquis Microfiber Body towel I have purchased.  The waffle weave makes a huge difference.  I had a plain microfiber towel and it just didn't feel like a towel.  The Aquis towel has a real towel feel, dries me off  great and then dries out quickly.  I keep it in my gym locker and it's dry the next time I need it.  In the summer, I use it after swimming in the morning and it's dry by the time I teach swimming in the afternoon.  And it doesn't take up much room in my locker or gym bag.  It would be great where I used to spend my summers in Michigan where it was tough to dry out the beach towels.
