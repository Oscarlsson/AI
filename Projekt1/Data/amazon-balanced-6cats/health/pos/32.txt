This is a great drink. I wanted to try something that was different, and this definately fit in. It isnt carbonated, and tastes really good.

What I really wanted to know though, was how it worked. There is no caffeine or taurine, and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary.

It worked well though, and I was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it
