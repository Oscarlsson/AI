My Mom came home from rehab and needed an easy way to reach her remote, pills, magazines, eat breakfast... and still get the  table out of the way so she could reach her walker.  This type of tray was very useful in rehab.  However she didn't want something the looked like the hospital.  The white top with a space for a drink and pens and pencils that don't roll away when you move the tray was perfect.  She liked the white top (vs. the wood grain in rehab) since she could tell when it was really clean.  She was also pleased with the foot rest as part of the base.  This was perfect.  The reason I rated this at 4 stars and not 5 stars was that the bed kit came with one incorrect size nut so I had to go to the hardware store.
