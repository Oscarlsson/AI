Overall an excellent trimmer - this is what I have been needing all of these years.  Finally a piece of equipment that does it all.  I have been very pleased with this trimmer - it is solid, and cuts without problem.  I love the adjustments, and the removeable head.  Thanks Remington, and my wife for the Christmas present
