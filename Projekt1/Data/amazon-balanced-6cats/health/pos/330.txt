I purchased the Caruso for my wife after returning a Conair Infinity. The Conair Infinity did not measure up to her expectations. She is happy with the Caruso and feels that it does an good job setting curl. I will offer a few observations of my own. I would think that companies that produce these devices would be more sensative to the needs of a broader spectum of customer. For instance, women have different lengths of hair. This device provides 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6 large, 6 jumbo. That might be fine for women with shoulder length hair, but not for everyone.
There's not enough of one size to get the job done. There's not enough of two sizes to get the job done. If your hair has just been cut, it's to short to use the larger sizes, unless you have long hair to start with. My wife's hair is not quite shoulder length, she's got a problem. So, I figured, no big deal, just order a dozen of the right size. One dozen additional rollers cost $35. I only paid $29 for the unit with 30 rollers.
That's not what I call customer friendly.
