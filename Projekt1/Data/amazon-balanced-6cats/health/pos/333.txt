Now I finally have the look and feel of a celebrity.  The best product on earth period!  I've tried all ingrown hair product's since 1985 beleive me Ive' spent thousand of dollars, nothing comes close to it "forget about it" Saliylic Acid is history in my book. Sorry Dermatologist their is a cure.  I bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006.  Since the new year 2007 started I've already bought 2 bottle's and I'm spreading the word.  Don't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away.
Thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face.
