This humidifier is easy to refil and not a  big eye-sore even in small rooms.  Also, stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers.  Would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours.  Which I guess it's good that it's easy to refil.  The price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price.  Perhaps you pay for the convient size.  
Overall, I really do like this humidifer and is the only one I like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size.
