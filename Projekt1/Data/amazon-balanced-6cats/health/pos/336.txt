As soon as I got this item, I tried it out right away.  I will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that's a minor point.  The real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do -- take down mosquitos and flys.  Sure enough, I killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes.  I also took down a housefly without any sweat.  This is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where I'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects.  No more an issue
