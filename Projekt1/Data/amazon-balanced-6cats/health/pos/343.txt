As a dentist of over 20+ years experience, I have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one's teeth.  The unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline.  The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.  

I have heard all the excuses for not flossing: The floss is too hard to handle, my fingers turn blue, my fingers are too fat, I'm too clumsy, the floss hurts my gums, etc, etc.  This disposable flosser is great for kids, who may not have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser, such as the "Flossaide Dental Floss Holder", which I recommend for adults (see my review).    

I have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and I strongly recommend it to you as well.  One still has to develop the habit of flossing daily, and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing, making it a breeze.  Get it and save your teeth!
