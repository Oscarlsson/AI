This is a great fiber supplement!!  When you chew it, it starts out kind of crunchy but quickly turns chewy kind of like a chewy sweet-tart.  I usually keep a glass of water by even thou it says you don't need water. They have a good flavor and yes I do use it as a substitute for candy every once in a while. Just remember too much of a good thing will give you gas :-) so don't be in a small elevator.
