Great compact design. Takes up very little room in your suitcase. Rollers heat up & are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims. Sets hair better then most rollers (and I have tried many). The only thing that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers. But I liked these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set & use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!
