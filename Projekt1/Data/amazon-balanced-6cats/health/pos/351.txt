This is the one I buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office. It is like the one I bought 5 years ago with my first baby, the one that is still humming along.

I have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child, a boy who persists in having 'tiny' ear canals even though he is three now. It has worked well for every other kid I know though.

About the variation in temperature taking. My advice is to practice taking your and your children's temperature while you and they are healthy. For one thing, not everyone has the `standard' 98.6 degree normal temperature; and for another thing it isn't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal. It takes practice.

A good home purchase. (For really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success.
