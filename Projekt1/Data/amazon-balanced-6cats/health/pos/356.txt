Dr. Scholl's Foot Cream was excellent. It's a rich overnight foot cream with a pleasant smell. My feet felt softer in the morning after using it at night and I noticed a difference immediately in my dry, cracked heels. I also ended up using it on my hands and elbows before I went to bed. Especially my hands were really soft in the morning. I've tried other foot creams and not been really impressed. But I think the difference is that Dr. Scholl's has no alcohol in it, and it's really rich so you can actually feel the moisture in your skin
