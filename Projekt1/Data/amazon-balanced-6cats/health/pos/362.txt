My bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light.

I received the Tranquility Zone eye mask for a birthday present and I could hardly wait to try it. I LOVE this thing! It's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and, due to the design, the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears. The sounds are pleasant (I'm a big fan of the "Babbling Brook" track) and I love being able to plug my mp3 player in so I can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks, too. 

I've given this 5 stars because there's no option for 4.5. In all honesty, there are a few drawbacks. First, when I say this is thick I'm not kidding. Without my A/C in the summer it might get a bit warm. Second, the sound clips themselves are on very short loops... so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you're hearing you'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so. Were it not for this I'd be a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like you're in a forest -- but I get distracted (and awakened) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades.

Even with these things in mind, I have to say I haven't slept this well in YEARS. I love this thing, and I wish I'd found it earlier. In fact, I love it so much I've given it as a gift to two friends who'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it, too
