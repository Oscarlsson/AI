If you have trouble sleeping...THIS mask is for you!!  For anyone struggling to get even a few minutes worth of sleep...  You will not be disappointed!!  Fabulous!  Whether for a nap or for getting through the night - this mask will definitely help!  I have given several as gifts and everyone is in agreement with me!  The only negative is - the company changed from an endless sound model to 30 minutes of sound...therefore - I wake up and have to re-hit the sound selection...but, I'm still getting more sleep than I have in years and years!
