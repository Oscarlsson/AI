I looked a many other back support pads.  
Some were too big, and others were just complicated.
The Obus Forme Side to Side is perfect.
It is very light weight and small, therefore, very portable.
I use it in the car and take it with me to the office.
The strap on the back fits well around any chair back,
although, I have found I don't need to use it because it stays put
