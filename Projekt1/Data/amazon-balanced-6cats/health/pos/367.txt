The stuff can seem somewhat pricy (specially on a college budget) but it's well worth it. The taste isn't much to talk about; you're better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once. Then again, weightlifters don't eat supplements for taste do they? I have a huge energy problem, I lack it a lot. Between class and work, I'm usually drained at the end of the day, but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard. This isn't to say that it won't requre motivation on your part, but it sure helps. During the workout, you may notice an increase in your pump. My muscles felt so tight and big, that I just wanted to lift more and more. By the time I was done, I went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror. I've had great pumps before, but this was insane! It didn't even look like me at all; it felt great. I've been using it for 2 months now and I don't train a day without it. Highly, highly recommended
