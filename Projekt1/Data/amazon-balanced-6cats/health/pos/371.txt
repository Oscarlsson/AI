Its a freakin wet nap, what else can I say? Not much to critique here.
I live in a small town & their kind of hard to find so Amazon to the rescue.
Pros:
1. style(square)
2. looks. It doesn't shout "hey I'm a wet nap"
3. shape. It stays put in my truck & doesn't roll around.
4. does a great job of what its intended to do, nothiing more.

cons:
1. Non
