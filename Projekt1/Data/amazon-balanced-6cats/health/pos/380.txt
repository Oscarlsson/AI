Had I read these reviews before buying this, I probably wouldn't have purchased it.  But I had been looking at the much more expensive Sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended Sonicare after I asked.  I didn't ask if there was a certain MODEL that he recommended, so I assumed I'd have to pay from $40-$150 for a Sonicare.  When I saw this one for $30 at Target, I figured I didn't have much to lose.

I've had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist couldn't get.  It turns off automatically after 2 minutes, so I know that I'm brushing my teeth longer.  One thing that takes getting used to is NOT removing it while it's going...you'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself! :D  Another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush!!  

The only negative is that it goes thru 2 AA batteries about once a month, but the directions said that it lasts about 60 brushes per battery change and that's about right.  I've started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems.
