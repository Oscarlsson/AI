I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave. And isn't that what we want in the end? 
I don't know anyone who buys one of these things for its "ergonomic design features." It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice. Rinse it clean with running water and you're done. That's what I'm looking for.

The only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running. It seems like it's always needing a charge...but that's how it sounds at full charge. It will take some getting used to I guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus. 
Also, the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated.
