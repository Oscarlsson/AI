Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and just love it. Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip. The only con I see is the 8 hour charge time, which has been the norm for Norelcos in this class for a long time. If you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price, this is a great choice
