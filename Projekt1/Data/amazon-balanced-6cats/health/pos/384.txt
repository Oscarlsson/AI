Upgraded to this razor after my old Remington died, and I've been very happy with it.  It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the "Lift & cut."

This would be an excellent razor if it wasn't for two features (or lack thereof) that make it a pain to use.

1.  The internal battery is NiCd.  This type of battery has "memory" to it, which means for optimal performance, the battery should be fully drained before you recharge it.  Otherwise, the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless.
2.  There isn't a low battery indicator.

By itself, either of these features wouldn't pose a problem.  Combined, you're left wondering when you'll have to charge the shaver, or when you're off on that business trip, if you'll need to bring the charger.

In the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that's not 15 years old.
