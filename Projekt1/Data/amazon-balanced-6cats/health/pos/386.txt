Product arrived as expected.  I've had the tooth brush for about a year now and I love it.  One complain I have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty.  It cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach.  I have not tried soaking it in Oxyclean, that might work even better.
