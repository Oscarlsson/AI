The first epilator that I used was The Epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's.  I did not use this for long....
A tool of complete TORTURE!

I finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from "VEET" which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that I was completely hooked on using an epilator. Good-bye razors and wax!

I figured that if a single roller did a good job that the Conair which had two rollers would do even better. The Conair does a good job and I'm keeping it as my spare,  but the epilator from Veet actually does a better job.  

I no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and I even do my bikini area and underarms.

I love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing.
Once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over.

UPDATE:  I've had more time to use the Conair Epilator and now I've actually been using it more than my "Veet".

Just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it.

As a matter of fact I am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends
