I pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b/c washable ones were sufficient.  With my second child, I did both and I found these to be the best b/c washable ones are not enough.  They are large so won't shift when you roll in bed.  They are very absorbent though I have woken up a couple times trenched.  They are very thin and discreet.  Other pads are not as big so not enough overage.  I never bother with the adhesives b/c they don't work.  They are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk.  I just wished they were softer and less paper like
