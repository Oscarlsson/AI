As an ER/Trauma nurse I have seen and been involved in many, many cardiac arrests. Here is some information that you need to know 1) You must still perform adequate CPR, if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain! 2) Even with trained personnel, CPR, a defibrillator and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (medications) the survival rate is very, very low. 
I am not telling you this to discourage purchasing this AED it is a wonderful unit I have been trained on it and had to use it once. I am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over $1000 on a defibrillator (especially for a private home)then a good idea would be to spend another $50 and take a basic CPR class. I hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it!!
