I found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what I want it to and I only paid $14.99 for it. It doesn't cause my hair to frizz up and it's easy to style when I take the rollers out. As far as it taking too long to heat up, I don't really let that affect my review because I plug it in and while it is heating up I do my makeup or something else. (I'm a multi-tasker anyway)  I also don't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair.  Overall I like it.
