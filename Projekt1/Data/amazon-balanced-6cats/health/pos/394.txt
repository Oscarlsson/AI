I have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it. It gets very hot/warm very fast and is very comforting. I use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches. I would recommend this product to anyone. I'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift
