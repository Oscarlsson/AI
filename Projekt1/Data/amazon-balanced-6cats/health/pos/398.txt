This hair dryer is truly a professional, salon type dryer. Many dryers are advertised as such, but this one lives up to that reputation. Very sleek, beautiful coloring and easy to handle with Turbo feature. This was a surprise(turbo) which I'm enjoying, coupled with the smooth and strong drying. The sound is even pleasant, not too loud, and it works quickly.(especially since I have very thick hair)
I would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price.
