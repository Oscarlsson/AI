We keep this in our kitchen and sanitize dropped baby toys and pacifiers as needed.  It takes a 30 minute cycle, and you just put things in and walk away.  It hasn't damaged anything vs. sanitizing in the washing machine - and I don't have to worry about any chemical residue from spray sanitizers.  We've even started to use it on more things around the house like toothbrushes, etc. to periodically clean them.  I think it's great
