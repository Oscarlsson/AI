Works great but I wish I could find it in stores.  The one RiteAid that does carry it, doesn't always have it in stock.  I also can not always find it in just any Rite Aid.  Some don't carry it at all...annoying! 

My daughter is the canker sore sufferer.  I did some research before I discovered Rembrandt, and found that the ingredient, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, found in almost all toothepastes is the culprate.  Rembrandt for Canker Sores does not contain this key ingredient.  Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is what makes our toothepaste foam.  My daughter hardly ever has anymore canker sore breakouts.  If she does, it seems to be from getting a cold.  Try and find a toothpaste without SLS...they aren't out there.  It would be nice to have some competition to bring the price down and be more readily available.  But all in all, I'm glad someone has made this product available, even if it's pricey and hard to find.
