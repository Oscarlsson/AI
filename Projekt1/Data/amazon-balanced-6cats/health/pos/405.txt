These wipes are strong, have just the right amount of moisture, and don't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave. My son had diaper rashes as a newborn; when we were at home, we could wash/rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering, but when we were out, and had to use wipes, his rash would flare up. After switching to these wipes and 7th Gen diapers, the rash went away. Later on, I tried Pampers again, and the rash came back. Using Seventh Gen really has kept his skin rash free. My older son also has a lot of itching when we use Pampers; much less with these wipes & diapers
