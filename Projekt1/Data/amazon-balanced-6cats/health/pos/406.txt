I don't know if it makes your hair shiny or not (I never noticed increased shine) however, I do think it does it does a nice job.  It worked better when my hair was around shoulder length, but it puts a nice curl in your hair and as long as it's not too humid out, it stays in.  Now that my hair is down to my waist, it doesn't hold curl anymore.  Just a little on the ends and if it's even a little humid, forget it.  The main thing that bothers me about this set is the clips that hold the rollers in.  I don't know what they were thinking, but they really suck.  They pull on your hair a little while they're holding the roller in and make you look an awful lot like madusa.  Anyone who happens to see you will most certainly have a few jokes and laughs
