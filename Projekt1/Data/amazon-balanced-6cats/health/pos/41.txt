At church today I came upon a man who had partially collapsed.  Since I'm a physician, I stopped and offered aid.  It turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was having some pretty concerning symptoms.  To my dismay, we do not have an AED at our church (yet).  We notified 911, and he was taken for medical care without any problems, but I was a bit worried there for a few minutes.  While I'm trained in BLS, that is, at best, a temporizing measure.  AEDs have a proven ability to diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms.  In my opinion, places of public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices.  I'll be working with our church to see if we can get one.  I would have been a bit more relaxed waiting for EMS if I had had one of these today.

However, buying an AED is not a cure-all.  I have been trained on these, and they are very simple to learn to use.  However, I think it would be quite difficult for someone who had never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac arrest.  If you are considering buying an AED for home or public use, I strongly suggest reading the section on AEDs at the American Heart Association website.  It discusses some of the important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a device.

So, while not for everyone, this is one of the few products available that can truly save lives.  In the right situation, it is indispensable.
