Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken.
