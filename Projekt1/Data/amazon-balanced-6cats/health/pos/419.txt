I used this while breastfeeding my son...and while I only had one issue of chapping, it was a lifesaver.  I loved it then and have used it on several other things since..great on chapped hands, lips etc.  But I don't know what I would have done without this wonder creme.  And it's an essential baby gift that I tend to give at showers!
