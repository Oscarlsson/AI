I have had this heating pad for over a year and am very pleased with it.  The auto shut off is annoying when I forget to reset the pad and it goes completely cool but otherwise, very pleased.  Just ordered one for my grandma and she is thrilled with the soft cover and the fact that it doesn't "rattle" like the old fashioned ones.  Great improvment and larger size
