This razor is fantastic. The gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad!! The only problem I had with it was the gel parts don't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would. But if you are looking for a quick, handy and yet still good shave, this is exactly what you are looking for
