I have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries (6 two-packs) and I must say that they work exactly how I projected them to. They hold a charge well enough for my uses in  various electronics and my infant's papasan swing. Regular Duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days. These batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines' life and I have recharged and reused many times already with no sign of charge loss. I am very pleased so far with my purchase. Get these until hybrid nimh batteries in size D become easily available and cheaper
