I have a Braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews I just had to try out the Panasonic and I am v impressed.
Dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too, a v close shave in about 2 minutes. I keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness.
I dont use the cleaning station, I just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results I am getting I am well pleased
