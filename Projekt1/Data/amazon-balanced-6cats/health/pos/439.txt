I work at a nursing home for the elderly and travel my entire lunch break to take my kindergardener to daycare after school and then pick him up with my two year old to go home, and to know that I have this product at my beck and call. WOW!! I am a owner of this product for 6 months now and I all I can say is I love it.. So what is requires special water a gallon lasts me for two months so I don't mind spending $.75 every two months. I use it in conjunction with my pore cleanser from Panasonic and I now I use less make up than ever. I normally wear foundation, pressed powder and loose. Now it is just pressed powder. It allows my natural glow to come out and minimized my pores. I do my facial with a towel over my head to intensify the treatment along with a favorite cd and I am on a fifteen minute vacation without leaving home.  I take the towel  off and my pores are ready for the final stage. I turn on the cool mist and apply a moisturizer at the last minute and I am ready to face another day.
