I'm usually a very skeptical person and I don't trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time. But these vitamins actually do work. It takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they work. So if you need something to help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show results. The only thing I hate about the product is the price. But if you have money and want help with growing your hair then you're in luck. I'm young and I don't have alot of money so I can't buy these vitamins all the time. But if you have a steady cash flow then you're in luck and they will totally help you
