I was skeptical of this product - especially at the price - however I am so pleased with its effectiveness.  I rely on other reviewers remarks and so I am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price.  I can't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple. When I think of all the money I've spent on products over the years - and I'm in my 40s!  I was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red, angry looking spot.  This product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne.  I only wish the Zeno was around when I was a teenager
