These glasses are a great idea.  However, they do not work with long hair.  The back "strap" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need reading glasses don't have long hair
