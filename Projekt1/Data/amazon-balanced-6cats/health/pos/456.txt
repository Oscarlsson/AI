This was my heating pad, but my hairless cat took it over. He has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one. The first day I couldn't pry him off. 

I love that it's washable. In fact, I'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash. Of course, I keep it pretty low for him. Being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that's not enough.
