I've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair (and have it stay straight)! I am happy to say that I've finally found something that works! I've had many different straighteners, and this one is by far the best. I have long curly hair, and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes. Much better than the hour I'm used to. Plus, the straightening lasts. My hair stays completely flat all day, instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener. You simply can't get better than this!
