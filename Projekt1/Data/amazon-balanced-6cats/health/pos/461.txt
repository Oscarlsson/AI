I bought this straightener at the advice of my hairdresser (well, the PINK one was my idea) and this is by far the best product I've ever used. I even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great - and it's usually a nappy, tangled mess after I work out. There really is nothing better than the CHI for straight, silky hair. I've used it on a couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it. It's worth the price
