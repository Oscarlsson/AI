My arms used to get so sore because I'd blow-dry my thick, frizzy, curly hair for about 1 1/2 hours and then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from wal-mart.

After having a stylist at Mastercuts use this on my hair and achieve even better results in under half an hour, I knew I had to buy this product.

This is a great price considering at most places like Trade Secret, the iron alone can cost about $129 plus tax, plus the Chi products are $15 and up.

It's a great value, and it benefits a great cause, so why not?

So if you have unruly, thick, curly hair- this is the product for you!

Just be careful because it does get really hot- I burned my ear a bit. Other than some common sense, anyone can use it and achieve great results.

I tried messing with it to flip out my hair and curl it, and I've almost got it down
