First, this is a big and cumbersome....  but second, this is the best foot spa.  Got it for the wife and had to try it myself.  I am a wuss when it comes to super hot temps and I had to ease into the heat, it stayed hot the entire time.  The jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless (just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you don't have to move an inch :)  ).  The rollers on the bottom are nice too.  It gets loud when on high-jets mode, but nothing to grand.  Fast shipper, would recommend
