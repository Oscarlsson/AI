The dispenser looks good, holds a decent volume of shampoo, conditioner etc. It is simple to refill the bottles, and so far there is no leakage. The mounting was easy, glued onto the tiles with silicone glue (included). If it broke or we decided to replace it, we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles. The top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front, so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head, the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf. The little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads. Overall satisfied, good product for the price
