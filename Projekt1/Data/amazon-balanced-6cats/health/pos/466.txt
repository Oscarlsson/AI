This was sent to my daughter and son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit. I had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up.  They love it!!! Not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap, shampoo,etc., my son-in-law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well
