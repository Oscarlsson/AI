I own this unit for more than a year. Bought it in the local drug store for $20. First unit was bad, displaying low battary error. I exchanged it same day for another one. I compared readings with traditional thermometers  and found it to be very accurate, fast, and can show in both C and F. The best I've ever had.
The case is bad - lock broke in a week
