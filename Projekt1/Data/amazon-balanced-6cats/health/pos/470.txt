I was all set to do the typical 10 day antibiotic course for a sinus infection (I even had bought the antibiotics), but decided to try this first. It is very effective in clearing the sinuses, nose, throat and lungs. Couple things:

1. It makes a minor mention of using a solution (if desired) in the tank provided. I used Vicks. It more than doubles the steam output. So even if you don't get a solution, use plain water. Without it, the output is not impressive.

2. If you do get Vicks, get your magnifying glass out and read the dilution instructions. They do not make it clear without reading the fine print that it is a highly concentrated solution. If you add it undiluted, I think you'll go blind...

I highly recommend this unit
