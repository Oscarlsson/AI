This is a great sized foot bath.  I pour hot water in it, sit back and relax.  It doesn't keep the water warm, but if I start off with really hot water it stays warm until I'm ready to get out.  Using the pedicure attachements is hard work though- I just assume use a hand-held brush.  The bubble feature is too loud to use while watching TV.  Still, for the price, I like this foot bath. I've even given it as a gift
