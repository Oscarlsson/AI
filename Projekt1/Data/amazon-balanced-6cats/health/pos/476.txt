I bought this for my boyfriend. I needed something affordable, and this was it. The bubble machine is quiet, and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time.
The only complaint i have are the warnings it has. It just gets me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if I make a mistake. 
well other than that, this product is good. I've had it for I think a couple of months now, and nothing awful has happened and it's still working fine. :
