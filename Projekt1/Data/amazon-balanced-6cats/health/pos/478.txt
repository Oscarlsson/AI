I've had my son in Huggies brand since he was born. I started out with newborns and just went up in size. I loved them and they never sagged (unless they were really full). I loved the trim look to them. When I had to get Pampers brand because the store was out, the pampers brand always looked like he had a full sagging load. Even if I had just put them on and they were dry!
When my son was 1, he decided to take off the "tape" on the daipers and he just would not keep it on. So I switched him to pull ups. He kept those on and has been in pull ups for 3 years. Sometimes they did leak at night, because he went too much, but if I changed him once a night he was fine. Now that he's older, I don't have to change him, because he doesn't go at night.
These are really best out there, and they don't look like they are always sagging like other diapers
