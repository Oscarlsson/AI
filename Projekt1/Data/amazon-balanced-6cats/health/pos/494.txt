It's all in your technique (which took me many trials to learn)

If you have had professional microdermabrassion then you will know how much scrubbing and pressure you will need to apply on your face. The crystals are abrasive and if you do not have the proper techniques you will hurt your face. I use the crystals in pure form ONCE a week (without the vibrating mechanism) BEFORE BEDTIME. These are the steps I do that WORK FOR ME. You may have a different system that might WORK FOR YOU.

1.	Thoroughly wash face with cleanser (I use Neutrogena facial liquid soap) and rinse well.
2.	While still damp, I use crystals to thoroughly exfoliate my face avoiding eye area. I go around in QUICK circular motion while applying pressure for 1 minute.
3.	I rinse quickly and use Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser to get all the crystals out since crystals are difficult to get out(it is also soothing).
4.	(Its not over yet) After patting my face dry I follow up by using Neutrogena Pore Refining Mask. It's a cooling gel that you keep on for 5 mins to tighten pores. Rinse off and pat dry.
5.	I do not put anything else on my face before sleeping.

My face comes out really fresh, soft and smooth. The next morning I just use the cream cleanser to wash.
