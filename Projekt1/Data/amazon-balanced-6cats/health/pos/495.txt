Compared to the first humidifier I got from walmart, this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect. Oh, well I just got it yesterday so it's too early to say perfect, but considering others' reviews, I am pretty confident that I am gonna love it longer than at the first sight.
The only thing is I don't know where to put it. The power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long. I am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest, or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time
