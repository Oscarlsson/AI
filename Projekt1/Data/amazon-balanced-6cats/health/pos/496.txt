I have two penguin humidifiers which I purchased a couple of months ago. For the money I think these are great and simple to use. I did not have any problems with leakage--the key is to make sure that the top is on securely. Also, some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base--just carry a washcloth with you--no problem.
Super quiet. I think it is just the right size for a bedroom. Easy to clean and fill. I had tried others (honeywell and vicks) and this is by far my favorite
