This item is great. It holds shampoo and conditioner, or whatever liquids you need in the shower, and also has a handy basket that I use to keep the shower spray cleaner and my shaving cream. The handy hooks hold my razor and my washcloth. Really cuts down on the clutter and puts everything in one place. However, I had to buy this item from another vendor because Amazon kept delaying shipment. After the delays had exceeded a month, I finally cancelled my order and went elsewhere. Good product, bad transaction
