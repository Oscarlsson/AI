I had been using a spring scale for years and it was fine until I went to a friend's house and saw what I was missing. I put that scale on my wish list that day. This is a lightweight , fairly compact  scale with "on/off" "tare" and "grams/ozs." buttons. it has a clear, plastic,removable bowl for measuring and says it can weigh up to about 3lbs. and down to 1/4 oz. I like it for its slim design its ease of use and for its easy clean up
