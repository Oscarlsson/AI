By far, the best hair straightener I have purchased. I have spent so much time, money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results. I can now say that I have found it. I bought the 2" Turbo and it gets the job done on my course, naturally curly hair. One of my all time, favorite purchases. I never travel without it
