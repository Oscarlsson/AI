I've had this product for almost a year now.  I have very thick, frizzy, hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months, and blowing drying it straight.  I've never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair.  But with this one, I have not needed a blow dryer since I got it!  Now my hair is straighter than it has ever been in my life, which I thought I would never see.  Of course this makes it very straight so I can't get any shape or curls from it(which is what I was going for). Cut my drying time by almost 2 hours (as long as I apply some protective serum on when still wet).  Great product and still going strong.
