I mean come ON, who needs 5 blades right?

Well, after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the Mach III was over a twin head razor, I decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so I took the plunge, and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations. 

The first thing I noticed was that this new Fusion has a more powerful engine than the Mach III. The second thing I found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore. And I find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about. But I do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what I mean. haw haw 5 Blade
