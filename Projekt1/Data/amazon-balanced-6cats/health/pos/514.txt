This is my second Norelco Wet Shaver. So, yes, I like the product. Here's my rundown:
Pluses:
  - Good shave
  - Less razor burn
  - lot easier to insert packets (compared to my older model)
  - easy to clean
Minuses:
  - Hard to get that "patch" under your nose
  - Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight
  - battery/power seem to wane at times
  - packets are expensive
I'm a cheap SOB, so here's my way of stretching out the life of the packets. Wet your face first with hot water, rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion. Do a first pass shave. Rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face/shaver. Keep a blade on-hand to get the under-the-nose patch and your sideburns.
