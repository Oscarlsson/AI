I took "My" unit to a monthly meeting for seniors.  Their machine broke & I took mine as a replacement.  They liked it so well, they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings.  They like all the different aspects of the machine.  A suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet & write down the date & the numbers from the machine?
