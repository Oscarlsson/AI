I have tried many contact lens solutions, and this one works the best for me.  Since switching to Acuvue 2 disposable lenses a couple of years ago, I noticed that my eyes did not maintain their moisture as well as with my former daily wear lenses.  Some solutions burned my eyes even after rinsing my lenses in saline, but the OptiFree is truly different for me, helping to clean my lenses daily and seemingly helping to maintain their flexibility and comfort all day.  Although I still rinse the OptiFree off of my lenses with saline before wearing them, I have found no irritation.  And, even better, daily rinsing and overnight storage in the OptiFree help me to extend the life of my disposable lenses for several weeks beyond what I could without using it.  That saves money because I have to purchase lenses less frequently.  Give it a try, especially at this price!  Wow
