And now a word from David Lynch, as spoken by Dean Stockwell as Doctor Yueh in DUNE: "The tooth. The tooooootttttttth. Remember the tooth."

Seriously, my daughter loves Dora the Explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her teeth for longer than two minutes.

I bought this Dora the Explorer battery powered electric toothbrush, and she does.

Game. Set. Match.

Best money I ever spent on simultaneous child and parent satisfaction.

When I tested this model on my finger, I was surprised at how powerful it was for a child-sized unit. This electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off her skull, but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing.

Battery life is okay, I estimate it costs about ½ a cent for her to brush her teeth each time. The future value of that expenditure is far lower than the dental bills I'd otherwise have, so this is a money saving unit.

If your child in a member of the Dora cultus, this is one of the better items to own
