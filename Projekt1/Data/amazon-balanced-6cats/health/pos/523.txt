To start - I miss my hair. Last september I cut my hip length hair to mid back, and then in december to just at the shoulders, and then again to the chin in January - and from January through June I trimmed it regularly to keep it that length. (I've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - I couldn't get it out via any other method tried except "growing out"). My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you get.
My last cut was late June - and it was at mid to upper neck length  - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut, and then layered. That got rid of the really saturated henna'd hair - so I was ready to start growing it out. After much digging around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad. I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of July and started taking them. Last night - maybe it was wishful thinking, but I noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day. He knows I've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color. Last night he looked at me and said "Hey wow - you're hair's really grown - I can see a half inch more of the roots! Wow - you're hair is getting dark!"
I was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins! I can't wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks, come August - if I have another 1/2 inch to add to it, I will definitely be reordering these pills!
But a side note, from previous reviews and my own experience... it's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day. I find taken a stage one pill at morning and afternoon, and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well.
