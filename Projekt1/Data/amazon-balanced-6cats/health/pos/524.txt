Hi,

I'm not a "review" person, but when I read the existing reviews, I felt like doing this.
I used this product for 2 months and I must tell you that it really WORKS!
I'm hispanic-black woman (dominican) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally, but only neck-chin lenght, no further than that. With this product I achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght.
I bought again the product to see how longer it can grows!!!

I've been completely sincere with you...I'm not a staffer of this product company, I'm a real and very happy user!!!

Hope this comment will be helpful for other women. I have only one last thing to say: Try it!!!! It worked for me..
