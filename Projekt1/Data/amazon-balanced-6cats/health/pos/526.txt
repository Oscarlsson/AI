I am in my early 30's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line, chin and cheeks for the past couple of years.  I have tried Murad, Proactiv, AcneFree and many other systems without success.  
A month ago I picked up the Neutrogena system when I saw it on sale. Within five days days my skin started to clear.  Now, I have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system. I have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before.  Finally, a product that works and comes at a decent price!
