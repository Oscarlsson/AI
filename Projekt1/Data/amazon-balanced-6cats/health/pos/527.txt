This is the best affordable acne solution that ive ever used. I had acne on my forehead and the acne started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just disappeared the next morning. On the box there is a sticker that said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right! Proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night. The only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight acne control lotion, it starts feeling like its harding into a mask on your face. It feels like its restricing muscle movement on your face. Its no biggy because it works and it washes right off in the morning when im in the shower. I cant believe a little lotion can make such a difference. If you are looking for acne solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are looking for
