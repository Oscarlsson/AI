I have seen these in catalogs before & didn't give them a second thought.  Then one day when I was cleaning under & around all of my shampoo bottles, etc in the shower, it hit me that one of these might just consolidate all the shampoos/conditions & body wash that I have collected in my shower.  So, I ordered one a higher price & I am so thrilled that I am ordering one for the kids' bathroom where I had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all the shampoos etc.  Now it will all be in one place, not messy & out of the reach of my toddler!  
The other thing that I have noticed is that I don't use nearly as much shampoo as I did before - I get a few squirts & if that isn't enough, I get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand.  I know I use far less shampoo than I did before I had this so I am no longer wasting it!  
This is just the greatest concept & this product is very easy to keep clean & it works & looks great in the shower.
I would recommend this product to anyone!  & if you don't think you will fill up all four sections - get a smaller one but I found the 4 section one is just what I needed; one for clarifying shampoo, one for conditioning shampoo, one for conditioner & one for body wash.  No more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom
