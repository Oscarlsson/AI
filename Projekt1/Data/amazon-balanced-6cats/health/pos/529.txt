This dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time. After initially filling the dispensers, it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button. It has been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all over the shower! It also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need
