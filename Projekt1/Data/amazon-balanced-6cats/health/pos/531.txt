I received this for Christmas from my Amazon Wishlist. I wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing.

I was a long time user of Norelco shavers, but switched to a blade since I couldn't get a close enough shave. Now that the whiskers are mostly gray, you can't tell for a few days if I shaved or not, so closeness is no longer an issue. I typically use this shaver in the shower, and have noticed that if you wash your face first, it takes more of the Cool Skin creme to give a smooth, close shave. Just a hint, guys. For the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles, dimples and Adam's apple cleanly with very little drag. My only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the 'stash & sideburns while showering. Small complaint that doesn't remove any ratings stars. All in all a great shaver
