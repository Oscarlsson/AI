   This shaver replaced a Norelco Advantage (6 years old) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days.  I can't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because I haven't shaved with a blade in many years.  

    I have used foil shavers in the past (Braun and Panasonic) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it.

    I have been using this shaver for about 3 months.  During that time I have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day.  At first I thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old Advantage which I thought was doing a great job.

   It shaves quick and close ( Personally I think as close as a blade).  When you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry. It doesn't get any easier than that. I have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too.

    The only con is I have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings. Use electric shave before shaving and I think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation. 

 Highly recommended and worth the price.
