The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great.  You might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going.  The directions, which I lost, said something about priming.

Installation was easy.  It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips.  I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  I figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and use Goof Off to remove the adhesive.

If you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart and it's a little rough
