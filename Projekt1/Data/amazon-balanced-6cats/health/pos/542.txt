I bought this to try it out based on a friend's recommendation.  Previously I'd always packed a couple old ratty towels with the dog's stuff before heading to the lake or the beach.  Now I only need one towel and it dries like you'd never believe.  I have a 65 pound dog that loves the water.  I make him shake the water off himself (a trick as important as sit or lay down when you have a dog this big) then I towel him dry in less than a minute.  I now own 3 of these towels and have purchased them for just about anyone I know with a dog that gets wet.  We live in Seattle so not only are we surrounded by lakes other bodies of water, but we have rainy winters.  Having one of these towels hanging behind the door with the coats was a god send this winter as well.  I can't speak enough praise about this towel.  Though a $30 pricetag for a meer towel could seem daunting, believe me when I tell you this is worth it.  You'll end up buying two
