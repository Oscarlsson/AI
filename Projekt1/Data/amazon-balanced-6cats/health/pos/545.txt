Just received this massager and my wife and I can't stop massaging each other with it. Especially great deal for the special Amazon price. I've been wanting one of these for years because I can hardly feel those little hand held ones (that just fit in the palm of your hand). Glad I splurged.

Only problem is that Amazon site says "7 heads", Item description says "6 heads", and actul product only included 5 heads. The one missing, from the picture on the box, is the "Acu Point" heads. I'm guessing that's why it's on sale? Still worth it if you get it on sale. Great massager.
