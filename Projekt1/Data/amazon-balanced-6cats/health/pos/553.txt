I never thought that I could get my hair straight enough to actually like it.  Until I found this VS Sassoon straightener.  It is THE BEST!!  I use it all the time and I love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather soft.  I would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super straight, soft hair, to use this product.  You can't go wrong!
