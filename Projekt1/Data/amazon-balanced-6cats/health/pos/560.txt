I bought this vaporizer several weeks ago. I feel better after I use this. It created steam very fast (about 2-3 minutes after plugging). You may have to fill some salt to make it create a lot of steam. However, a lot of steam means the water will decrease rapidly so if you want to use this vick for a long time(about 12-20 hours), you may not need to use salt
