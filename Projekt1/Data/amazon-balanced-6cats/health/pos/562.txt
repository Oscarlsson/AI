A good product, to be sure...I've used Seventh Generation's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased. This "review" is however a cautionary: while it states on Amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads, it is only rated for 18 loads. Just a heads up! 

[note: I tried to notify Amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment. Thus, this "review"
