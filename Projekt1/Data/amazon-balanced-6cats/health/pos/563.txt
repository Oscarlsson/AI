My first Aquis mitt was rectangular. I like this one better.  Rounding the edges makes sense since it is meant to be worn on the hand.  Aquis microfiber is the only fabric I use on my face. It is gentle on the skin, yet cleans more thoroughly than anything else I have used. (I find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric!)

If the manufacturer is listening, I would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2. This would be perfect for bathing baby/children. There is a slit in the seam, on the thumb side, so your thumb can protrude. You can grip/lift without removing your mitts. Some size choices (S/M & L/XL) would be nice, as this mitt would not fit a large man's han
