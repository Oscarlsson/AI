Casein is a great, long-lasting protein, perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey.  Casein, in general, is bland (think no fat, no salt, cottage cheese), and harder to mix than whey.  Optimum Nutrition has here a decent casein, that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein I've tried.  The price is ok, but I'd like to see it cheaper (who wouldn't?).  I mix it with whey and use it throughout the day.  I have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor
