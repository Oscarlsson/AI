I have Pergo and cannot get it too wet or the floor will bubble.  The Swiffer Wet cloths are the perfect solution. They're so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you're done.  I hate that I'm consuming a product that is so disposable, but at the same time, it works so well
