I purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason:  my old 1875 watt Conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom (the circuit kept tripping), so I was actually looking for a dryer with LESS wattage.  However, I didn't want to sacrifice power, as I hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair.

So far, I've been pleased with this hair dryer.  It does seem a bit louder than my previous model--not obnoxiously so, just a higher, more concentrated fan noise.  The dryer is extremely light and compact; it's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer.  It is very basic, with a choice of high/low settings only (there is no heat/cool option), but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer.  

Overall, this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price
