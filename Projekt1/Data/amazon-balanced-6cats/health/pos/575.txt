Compared to the Conair 1,600W I have used for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and high-pitched when I first turned it on, but you may have a high-pitched blow dryer now--compared to my old Conair--and won't notice a difference. It doesn't have a cold air feature, which many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to cause less damage to the hair; or like me, in the summer when the option of switching from hot to cold is preferable. These two drawbacks, especially having only the hot at high or low setting, is why I give it four out of five, instead of five out of five star rating. 

Pluses: price--for $13 it can't be beat for the frugal shopper; efficiency--it blowdries my hair a bit faster than the Conair did though I don't understand the science behind that; appearance--it's cute and compact; weight--a toddler could wield this blow-dryer with ease; carrying ease--small enough to fit neatly in just about any drawer or a crammed gym bag, under the sink, et cetera. 

I haven't had this long enough to rate how durable it is, so I hope someone who's owned one for at least a year comes on to write, "it's still going strong.
