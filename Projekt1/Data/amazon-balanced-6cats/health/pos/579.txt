I have been very satisfied with the monitor.  It is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate.  I was disappointed to find when I opened the box that there were no instructions included.  A quick phone call had them on the way.  I was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time, etc.  All-in-all it is a quite satisfactory device
