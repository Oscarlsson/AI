 I have used the unit for about two weeks, with NiMH rechargable batteries installed, and it performs as advertised. There is, in my opinion, a design flaw: the Start/Stop button acts as the power on{off function, and is easily depressed at unwanted times, e.g. putting into or removing from the case.  They could/should have included an AC adapter
