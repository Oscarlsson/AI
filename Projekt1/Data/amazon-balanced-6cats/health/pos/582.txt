I purchased the Sound Therapy Radio to take on a trip.  My roommate is a snorer, and I figured I needed the sound. I tried it out at home and liked it.  It has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use. The alarm and clock are added goodies for me as I was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel.  It was a good buy for my purposes.
