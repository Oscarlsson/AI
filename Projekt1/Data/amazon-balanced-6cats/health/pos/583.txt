I like the portability and adjustability of this mirror.  It takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly.  It serves my needs very well.  I was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit.  I tend to use the normal mirror more often.  The other is the clock loses it's setting when I stow it away.  It has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature.  As far as I am concerned...I was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock
