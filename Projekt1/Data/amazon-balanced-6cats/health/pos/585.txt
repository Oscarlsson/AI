I tried the ear thermometers and NEVER could get them to work.  

Our pediatrician used one of these "rub across the forehead" kind at her office during a checkup and said it was as accurate as the ear kind and MUCH easier to use ... especially when kids have earaches (... grabbing an itty-bitty earlobe and sticking that hard end into the swollen, sore ear canal??? ... ouch.)

With a minute's practice (after reading the instructions), you get the hang of using it and never dread checking temperatures again
