I have been using this razor for about 6 years now, probably as long as they have been out. They may be pricey but well worth it. I used to use disposables and nicked/cut my legs almost every time. I switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little. It is so quick and easy to use, and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams. They do only last for 3-5 shaves, but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream, it's probably not that much more expensive
