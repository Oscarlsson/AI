I just started taking this pill because I don't have time to eat at the job I was previously at.  It helped a lot!! I did lose 8 pound in 1 week. But when I started an office job, I had more than enough time to eat, but I still kept up with taking the pill.  It helps with my hunger, it really does.  I used to be so hungry and fill up my plate more than I can eat!  Now since taking this pill I am sensible with my portions and do not rush to eat as if I'm starving like before.  I agree with one of the reviews, if you still eat when you're not hungry, this pill will not help you.  You have to have the in mind that you want to help yourself eat better, slower and sensible portions.
