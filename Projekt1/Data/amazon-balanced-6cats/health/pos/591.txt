This protein is unbelievable. I have tried *many* different brands/varieties and this is without a doubt one of the best out there. It doesn't have the characteristic nausiating whey smell or taste, it's not too sweet, mixes lump-free in cold or piping hot water and packs a punch with 23g of easily digestable protein per scoop. Once you try it, this stuff will definitely become a staple in your pantry.
