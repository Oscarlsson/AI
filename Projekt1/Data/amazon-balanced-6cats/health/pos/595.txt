at first i didn't quite get how great this shaving cream is because you have to work a little harder to get it to lather than the other shaving creams or gels i had been using. but once it breaks into a lather, it's great. plus it lasts at least 3 times longer than regular cans of shaving cream/gel. i'm buying this from now on
