I'm not a sucker for advertising and I'm definitely not an impulse buyer.  But I did purchase a Schick Quattro razor some time ago to replace my old, tired blade.  And I've been satisfied thoroughly with it.  However, after needing some refills, I bought these Titanium Coated Blades.  Wow.  I didn't believe it at first but I actually took a new titanium blade and the regular Schick blades and (I can't believe I'm about to confess this...) did one of those hokey "side-by-side" tests.  This blade is excellent.  It is an upgrade above their standard blade and, to me, worth the difference in price
