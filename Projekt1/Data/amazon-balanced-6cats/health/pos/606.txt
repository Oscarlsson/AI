I bought two of these for my son....hoping to wean him out of pull-ups at night, without having to strip the whole bed when there is an accident.  This pad is definitely leakproof.  The only con is that even though it says it has an anti-slip backing....that is not the case.  I have tried it with jersey sheets, and flannel sheets...but it does move alot and get bunched up.  So, I do end up having to strip the bed every now and then because the pad moved during the night.   If I had it to do over again, I would definitely buy the pad with the tuck-under flaps.
