I bought the first mattress topper for myself and my husband.  After the first night I knew I wanted one to put in our RV too.  My husband complained about the smell when I unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in years.  He had me order one for his sister for Christmas. I thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so now I have purchased four!  This is a wonderful product.  I would recommend it to anyone
