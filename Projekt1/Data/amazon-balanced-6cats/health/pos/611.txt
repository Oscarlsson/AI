I've used the Pigeon brand (I believe it's from Japan) milk storage bags- those are the best-quality bags I've ever used. Unfortunately, they're also very difficult to find. These Lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1/3 of Pigeon's price. Not bad at all! My baby and I travel a lot so I bring along my stock of bmilk in these Lansinoh bags. No mishaps thus far. Highly recommended
