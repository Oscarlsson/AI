I've used this product with two of my children with out problems.  I have never had a leak unlike with some of the other brands.  Suggestions: Write the date on the bag before you start to pump or a nurse once suggested that you use labels.  Also, never fill the bag!  It's only meant to hold 6 oz.  

These bags are much thicker than the Gerber bags and they are the only ones to have the double zipper. I used these liners with my Avent Disposable system and standard bottles. 

I've gone through over 600 of these bags and I must say Amazon has the best price around
