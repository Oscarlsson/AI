These bags are much sturdier and thicker than the Gerber bags.  You also don't have to cut the bags open after defrosting/heating them up.  Amazingly they are cheaper than the Gerber bags too!  I've used them for several months and haven't had one leak yet.  But I am pretty careful and store the milk bags flat in tupperware containers in the freezer
