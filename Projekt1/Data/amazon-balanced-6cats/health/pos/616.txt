I have used every diaper in the market and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies, I have a big 21 month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper with no leaks!! My son still fits in the size % diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it, no leaks, no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning!
