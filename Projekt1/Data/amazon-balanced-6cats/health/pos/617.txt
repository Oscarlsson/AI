I used the Huggies Overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training.  I used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull-ups to get him through the night without leaks, but even that didn't work very well.  Finally, Huggies came out with an overnight pull-up - and it really works well!!!  Excellent product
