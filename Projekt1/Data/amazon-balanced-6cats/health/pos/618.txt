I have had this straightener for a while, and I still have no complaints about it.  It is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener.  I love the heat settings... I only need to put mine on the second setting (338 degrees) for it to do a good job, and I have very thick wavy/curly hair.  I like the 1" because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair, but I'm sure the 2" one is great too
