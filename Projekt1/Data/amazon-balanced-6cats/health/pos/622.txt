I have had a number of surgeries and injuries over the years.  I see a chiropracter and a physical therapist every few weeks. Both of them work wonders, but then my body tightens up.  I can't afford to see them every day!  I bought the theracane because I saw someone else with one at a long distance cycling event.  Now I've purchased another 3 to share with friends.

It works!  This tool has helped me stay loose, and has taken away a lot of the shoulder stiffness that I have suffered for the past 7 years.  I suggest the addition of the trigger point therapy workbook, which will give you a lot of the details about the body and why/where it hurts.  But even if you don't want to study, you can still get lots of benefits from daily use of the theracane
