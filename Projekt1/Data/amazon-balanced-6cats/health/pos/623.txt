The knots in my back - my "spots" never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer.  One day I asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was.  He explained the concept, I tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special.   The leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying STRONG pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there.  I bought one the next day.  You don't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots.
