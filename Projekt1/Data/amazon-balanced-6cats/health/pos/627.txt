This is a fine, well lasting bar of soup that smells like sweet oranges--you will catch wiffs of the very pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom.  It reminds me of tangerine lifesavers, if that helps.

It's a big bar, too, the dimensions of the bar are, in inches:  4 x 2.5 and 1.5 thick
