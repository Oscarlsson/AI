When my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him.  It was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings.  Then I bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out.  Just enough to see your baby by, but not enough to keep everyone awake.  It's been almost a year now, and I'm just about to purchase two more.  We use the light now in our toddler's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine.  We use it every night
