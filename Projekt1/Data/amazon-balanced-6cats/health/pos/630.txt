What I wanted for Christmas was something to turn my bath tub into a whirlpool, and my boyfriend bought this for me. The bubbles are no doubt amazing, they're plenty strong even at the lowest setting. As for the massage part, I didn't use that too much- it just vibrates some, and the bubbles seemed to be more massaging than the vibrating massager. The only thing I did not really care for is that it was kind of difficult to keep on the tub floor. It has suction cups, but they didn't work too well- everytime I moved my feet or legs, it wanted to float to the top of the water. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good gift! I will definitely use it many more times
