After 6 months of unexplained intense fatigue and malaise, numerous doctor visits without results, I obtained Source of Life vitamins upon the recommendation of a friend whose physician had recommended it for them.  With the very first dose, I went from dragging around to walking around--while most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen.

At my very next doctor's appointment, I told of my experience with Source of Life and I continue to report it to anyone and everyone that mentions being excessively tired.   Members of my family and several friends now regularly use this outstanding product, and have reported similar results.   Not only did I feel much better with higher energy levels, I also notice fingernail and hair growth as well.

I use the liquid version and it is actually very tasty.  I highly recommend this product.  I've used it for 3 years and have obtained consistent good results.
