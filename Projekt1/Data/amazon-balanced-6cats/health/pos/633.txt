If you wonder why you're feeling lethargic or if you have one of those little abdominal paunches you thought was just advancing age, then you might need probiotic therapy.  You might even need it if your resistance to colds is low!

Because we live much "cleaner" lives than our ancestors did, sterilizing our dishes, putting our food in the fridge, and spraying pesticides on everything, we live our lives virtually bacteria-free.  Free of the GOOD bacteria, that is.  The baddies seem to still get us, and without the good ones to balance them out, we're in trouble.

A lack of friendly bacteria in your intestines can cause problems throughout your body.  To put it in "nice" terms, it's a little like having backed up plumbing inside you, and the world just ain't gonna be right until you fix it.

I started on probiotic therapy several months ago, and I was amazed at the following things that happened almost immediately:

*That little stomach paunch WENT AWAY.  I kid you not.  Talk about an instant self-esteem booster.
*My chronic [men, cover your ears] yeast infections decreased dramatically (even without my eliminating wheat from my diet, which I know I ought to do).
*I had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago.
*I became more resistant to colds than I used to be.

If you're considering supplementing your diet with probiotics, you should know that not all of them are created equal.  In fact, testing done by www.consumerlab.com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic supplements don't deliver the number of live organisms they claim -- not even close!  Those little creatures are very delicate, and things like processing, shipping, and sitting on your shelf can kill them.  And let's not even talk about what your stomach acid does to them.

Primal Defense is one of the few supplements that delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to.  (I can tell from its effects on me.)  In addition, it contains lots of good-for-you green foods that also help build that all-important inner strength.

One very important caveat about Primal Defense, though:  Because it's SO effective, don't even think about starting out taking 3 tablets a day!  Not unless you don't mind a lot of abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by yourself at home.  I took one a day for about 2 months, and then I finally felt ready to move up to 2.  It'll be at least another month before I'm up to the recommended 3.

One more thing:  Drink lots of water.  You need it anyway, and Primal Defense works best when you're well hydrated
