Works as advertised and I am happy with it's function.  Much nicer than other battery powered toothbrushes.  One issue is that supposed "quick change" tool to remove the brush head either I can't figure out or it is defective, but once you put it on the brush head a pin is supposed to press into a slot to release the brush head.  It never releases.  Is there a trick to do this?  Also the instructions say put on the tool press in and then pull off the brush head.  The problem with this is once the tool is on and you press in, there is no way to pull off the brush head as the tool is still attached.  Once you take the tool off the brush head will not slide out.  Anyone figured this out yet
