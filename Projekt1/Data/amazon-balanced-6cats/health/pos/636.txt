I got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it's great.  I know I should probably replace the head by now, but it still seems to work fine, so I don't.  I've only changed the battery once.  If you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type, this is it.  Then again, if you're not lazy or weak, you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries
