i love these little bibs.  i say little, because even though they are the size of regular cloth bibs, the big size Bibsters, which i also bought, are HUGE, and cover my 9mo. old baby to almost past his diapers.  i was reluctant to buy Bibsters at first, because they seemed such a waste of material being disposable- and i guess they are-- however, they serve a good purpose in that they are extremely light and thin and fully waterproof, so that my super-drooler doesn't get his outfits totally wet like he does with his cloth bibs, which i'm frequently switching out.  Bibsters are also very easy to pack into the diaper bag, and i'm never without a bib. i've also been using the big size bibsters on my 2yr old in the car, for random snack spills.  these are not really reusable, but i sometimes do use them for 2 meals, depending on how clean they are. The price was right when Amazon grocery had the spend 50 get 10 dea
