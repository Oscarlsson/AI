I still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works!  this one works even better I have tried other remington shavers over the years  the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the  first one untill now! I found that by shaving in small circular motion  as  you move along your face you won't need williams lectric shave as I had with the other razors and it's much easier to claen! now if the just keep making replacement baldes I will be very happy for a long time
