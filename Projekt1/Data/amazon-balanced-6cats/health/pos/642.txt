  This is one of those products I'd put on my "must have" list if I had an elderly parent who couldn't handle a vaccumm and had some area rugs or runners near the front door or entrance to any room. For daily touch-ups, these things can't be beat. They are extremely light and get all the stuff that gets dragged into the house between deep vacuuming. 
  Of course, I really believe that a doormat at the front door will go a LONG way in keeping out a lot of the dust and debris. For the stuff that gets by that, use the Carpet Flick. I tend to shake out my runners and deep vaccum them regularly but I've noticed that some people who are elderly don't have the strength for that. 
     Because I help out taking care of two people over 90, this has been a great help to them in maintaining their independence and ability to keep things clean when I'm not around...and I'm all for helping people to help themselves stay functional!
