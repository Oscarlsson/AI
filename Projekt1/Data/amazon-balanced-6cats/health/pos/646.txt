I purchased this dryer to replace an older one that is far too loud.   While this new one is much quieter than the old one, it really isn't super-quiet.  Still, I have no complaints on the noise, but the flimsy wall mounting hardware is another story.  The threaded holes in the mounting plate are extremely fragile, so much so that they both were wrung out during the initial mounting of the dryer.  It didn't help any that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the plate was mounted - it's hard to see thru that white plastic shell.  I ended up having to discard the original threaded screws and use two slightly larger metal tapping screws to mount the dryer to the bracket.  This worked fine, but the original mounting hardware isn't very well designed in my opinion.  Other than that the dryer seems to work very well, although I haven't had it long enough to know how well it will last.  All in all, I'd give the dryer 4 stars out of 5
