I am one of the people who just doesn't like applying liquid foundation and cannot do it well, but needs more than just the light coverage of powder foundation. The New Complexion cream foundations do exactly that. I have used numerous cream (or liquid-powder) foundations and this is by far the best and at a good price as well!

The neat little compact includes a mirror and separate storage space for your sponge, which I love because I hate when my sponges become covered in product, all in the same space as a regular compact. I've personally never been one to use compact mirrors, myself, however.

But it's not the package or the sponge which I love, it's the product. It's neither too liquid nor is it too stiff, like some products. It's perfectly creamy and works well with the sponge it comes with.

You really needn't use a lot to have even overall covered but by using more you can obtain a thicker coverage. I find that this makeup blends well with my skin and does a good job of evening out my skin tone, as well, without appearing too much like a mask.

You can feel it a little but it somehow just feels right on my skin. Also, I do recommend using a powder over it to reduce shine.

Overall, I love this makeup
