I am very satisfied with Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo. Many anti-dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough. I have thick, waist-length hair and Nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage. Unlike some anti-dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell, Nizoral has a pleasant fragrance. I'll definitely use this product any time I need a dandruff shampoo
