The foot massager is great. It's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like. The massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit. The massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt, raise/lower and etc. The only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it. So keeping it upright can be a bit challenging. But for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet
