Saw this product, or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in Cairns, Australia.  It was selling for about $70 Australia Dollars.....which is still quite expensive converted to US$.  I came back to U.S. and found it on Amazon for $15.99, with free ship if I purchased $30.  So, I bought two......one for myself, one for my husband!  It is wonderful!  We wear contacts for distance, so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks, less the neckchains, which always used to get tangled.  It's an ingenius invention
