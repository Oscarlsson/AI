I'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews.  One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel contains no energy ingredients.  This is untrue.  Soldier Fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.  Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar.  The U.S. Military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash.  Most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine.  Since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.  
 
Another error is that Soldier Fuel has more sugar.  It has less.  One 12 oz. can of Soldier Fuel has 12 g of sugar.  The same amount of Gatorade contains 21 g of sugar.  The same amount of Red Bull has 39g sugar.

Finally, the support for the troops is not marketing hype.  Our company is partnered with the U.S. Military's Natick Soldier Center.  A portion of the gross proceeds from each can of HOOAH! Soldier Fuel and each HOOAH! bar directly funds research that improves the safety, diet, and quality of life of our troops
