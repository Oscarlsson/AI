I was looking for a lightweight simple wet/dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and blade assemblies. The Panasonic WES9941P fit perfectly. Gives a nice shave, and it's so easy to clean. It replaces my old Braun single head linear. (I like the Panasonic better.) The batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge. Give it a few weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close
