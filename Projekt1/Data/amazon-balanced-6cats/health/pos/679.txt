My husband and I have one drink of Nature's Plus every morning and sometimes at lunch or for dinner.
We started out with Vanilla. I add a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- 1 cup 1% milk and you're hooked! 
The ice cubes make it like a real shake. 
I have a Vita Mix and that realy makes it blend well. I blend for 30 seconds.
My husband uses the Vanilla with 1 cup of 1% milk - 4 TBS of Ovaltine - a handful of oatmeal- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- blend for 30 seconds and I don't have to cook!
I like the Strawberry. I take a cup of milk (1%)- 6 frozen strawberries- a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots - and 4 ice cubes. Havenly and very satisfying and losing weight to boot!
