Very happy with this purchase. Received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [...] credit card. It is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors. I like the History feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily!Good machine especially since it has an AC adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently!Also, the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
