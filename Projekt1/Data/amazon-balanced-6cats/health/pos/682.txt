I bought this bag for my husband as a surprise (as I had bought another brand, and he did not like the Asian floral print).  It's very roomy, looks great, fits ergonomically.  I really love the pocket design and the space that they have, as well as the interior design.  Fits things better than my own bag!  My husband loves it and can't wait to use it!  Plus that, this is the best price I've seen online, and of course, Amazon ships quickly and accurately
