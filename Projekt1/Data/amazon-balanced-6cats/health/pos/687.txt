There are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments.  I weighed both before I made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments.  I am glad I did.  The light from the mirror is bright, the slide bar for the different light settings works very well.  If you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time.  I enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use.

The only negative I have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but I am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out.
