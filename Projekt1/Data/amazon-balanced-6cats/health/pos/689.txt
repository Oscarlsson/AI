This is a useful tool in that it makes the software/hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other I am aware of.  My only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output, although from reading Heart Math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing.  However for the price it is definitely worth it and I could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack
