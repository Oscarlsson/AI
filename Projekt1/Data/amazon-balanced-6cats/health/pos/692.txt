I just bought a Vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high.  I needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet.  These goggles are awesome!  They fit perfectly inside my helmet, and because the wrap around my head, they stay put.  The magnets in front are very strong so the goggles don't move.  The eye cups are just the right size and they're padded for comfort. These goggles have far exceeded my expectations.
