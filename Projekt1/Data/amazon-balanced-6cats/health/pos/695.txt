I love all the varieties of chocolate, and if you mix them in a blender, they are smooth and creamy.  You can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes, and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake.  Shaking by hand or using a hand-held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice.  These are a great meal replacement - healthy, nutritious, and full of quality protein.
