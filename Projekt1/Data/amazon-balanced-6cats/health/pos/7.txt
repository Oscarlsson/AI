I really like these things.  They're certainly chewy, so they can be a bit of a jaw workout, but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar, and they keep you going for a couple of hours.  If only they were a little cheaper, say a dollar or less per bar, I'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than I do right now
