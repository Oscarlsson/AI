This handy little device has be a lifesaver in helping to remind me to take my pills.  It is easy to set up. Just put in the # of hours between your doses, 12 or 24 hours for twice a day or once a day medications. I use two of these. The timer counts down the hours and then chirps. When you silence the alarm, it automatically starts the countdown again.
The storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when I travel. Most of the time, I just use it to remind me to take my pills.
I wish I knew about this a long time ago
