I'm a vain, 39 year old male and started using this product (in combination with another highly regarded anti-wrinkle product) about three months ago. This daily application replaced a daily application of facial conditioner/moisturizer. I was hoping some barely noticable forehead wrinkles would go away. No such luck. I notice a definite reduction in wrinkle depth in the morning, before I shower, but by mid-day, the wrinkles have returned to their normal state.  Does this really work?! I suppose the only way to truly find out if this stuff works is to use it on only half the face and see the effect over time. In all fairness, I must mention that my face now routinely feels softer and smoother and less oily than before. That's why I rated this product a four instead of a three. But the frickin' wrinkles are still there!  Let me see all that clinical research all these skin care experts are touting.
