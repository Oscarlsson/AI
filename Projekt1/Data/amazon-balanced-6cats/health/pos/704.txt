Well, let's FACE it..short of any procedure that is invasive(botox,cosmetic surgery, etc), there really isnt any magic cream that is going to reverse the aging process, but there are a number of products that will aid in improving the look, feel and texture of your face. I've been trying out several of the products out there, and I found "Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream For Face and Neck" to be one of the best ones around.

I really like this one alot because of the many benefits it has all in one jar. After using it pretty generously for a little over a month(I've used about 1/2 the jar so far), I found it worked wonders on improving the look and feel of my skin. It minimized the appearance of fine lines, really hydrated my dry skin, improving on firmness, absorbed deep into my skin, so using it every night, I could still feel the softness the next morning, and left my face feeling very smooth to the touch. I especially felt and saw visable result around my neck and throat area(where I am really starting to get that over 50 look).

It has a nice, very light scent, and here's the best part... The price here at Amazon is about 1/2 of what I paid when I purchased it along with my groceries at the market(and it was even on sale at the store), so at around twelve dollars here right now, it's a real bargain.

There are 7 benefits listed on the box, some I mentioned above, others include evening skin tone, minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces the appearance of blotches and age spots. Give this one a try for any of these aging signs.

Don't expect a miracle. The wrinkles will not vanish, but a nice improvement in the look and feel of your skin, a healthy glow that leaves you feeling just a little better about yourself(and a a great price).

The formula includes a fast absorbing skin strengthener called VitaNiacin(Vit B3, Vit E and Pro-Vit B5),wheat protein and hydrators.

I like it and recommend it.....Laurie
