I've been wearing glasses for almost 25 years now.  Its been difficult to find a decent way to clean glasses that doesn't either streak or damage the lenses -- especially with AR and other coatings they put on glasses these days.  The Sharper Image eyeglass cleaner does the trick.  It also, by design, cleans your frames which is a plus.

I would have given 4.5 stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply.  Its sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses.  I have two pair (regular and sunglasses) so no real fault there.  I recommend getting a 3M microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what is supplied
