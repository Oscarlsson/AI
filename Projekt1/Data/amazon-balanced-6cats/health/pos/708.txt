The sound of it working is great ambient noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell wonderful! It does a reasonable job of humidification in my medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it. And it doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run for several hours. The light show and the aromatherapy can be quite a nice mood setter romantically as well
