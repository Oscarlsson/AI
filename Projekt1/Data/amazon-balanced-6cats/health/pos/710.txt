I've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and I have just finally begun to run out. While I don't use it everday, I use it regularly and when needed.

I use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated. This Nivea after shave is wonderful. It only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck. It leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling. Sometimes I'll leave the house and forget to put it on, and I'll go all the way back just to put it on. It gets your day off to a great start. No funky smells or textures here. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed
