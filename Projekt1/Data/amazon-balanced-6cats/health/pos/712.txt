I started taking Anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work. I am not usually a stressed out sort of person however I recently got transfered to NYC and I'm from Utah, just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out. I am working as a trader and it is very high energy. Anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here
