If you don't like getting attention, these are not for you.  I'm often surprised by people's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off; I'm so accustomed to pulling them apart, that I forget how unusual the viewing public finds it.  

I have been wearing Clics for nearly a year.  I pretend that I don't need glasses, but of course I do and have for nearly a decade.  Popped the standard diopter lenses out, and put in my bifocal prescription.  It worked great, despite a warning from my optical shop.  (And even if they had broken from the experiment, the price is right:  I could try it again.)

Previously I was wearing glasses on a chain.  Besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer, I also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching. Then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break.  

I call the color of mine "magenta" - which may or may not be the same as the online "red" - I bought them in a shop (**gasp**).  My short hair is not a problem, but I agree that reading in bed doesn't work.  So I use a different pair for those occasions
