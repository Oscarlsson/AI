After a few months of debating whether or not I needed the extra light for my work space I made the great choice of purchasing the HappyLite.  I've been using it the past few weeks and have really enjoyed how it brightens up the dark corner better than a regular lamp.

Now my only concern is how to order an extra bulb.... (guess I should read the materials it came with).
