I bought this for my father-in-law who had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old.  My mother-in-law at sixty seven, doesn't have a lot of arm and shoulder strength and cannot wield a full-size wheelchair around and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota camry.

The light weight of this chair works great for short trips to appointments.  I wouldn't recommend it for a long day shopping at the mall however.  It's not as easy to use as a full-size standard wheelchair.  This is a great chair for shorter trips and appointments to make transferring easier to manage
