I got into Aquis microfiber towels because my aged mother does not have the arm strength for big fat terry towels.  I then bought some for myself because besides being light they absorb like crazy -- one swipe and you're dry.  I decided to get one of the 'adventure' line because information was that they are like the dog-drying towels which are very like the lisse crepe ones.  What I didn't realize was not only I buying a very nice towel, it comes in a very nice little nylon zippered bag, mesh on one side to facilitate drying.  We're talking the sort of little bag you'd spend about $5 to buy from a travel gear catalog.  I was thrilled to pieces.  Also in keeping with the 'adventure'-travel theme, these towels have little tags on one corner that can be snapped back on themselves to form a loop to hang the towel from.  Very handy for camping, meaningless but not annoying for home use.  I like how the loop normally is just a long tag so that the loop does not tangle in the washer
