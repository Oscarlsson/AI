I am 100% satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what I paid for. I am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own, where as for a complete trim, I do need my wife's assistance. If you trim on a regular basis, ie., when the hair's not over grown, you will definitely find the job more easier.I recommend it to everyone who wants to save on their haircuts. The price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon, else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the Thanks giving sale
