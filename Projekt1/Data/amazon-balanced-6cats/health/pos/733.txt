These are hands down, the most awesome pillows, we have ever owned.  They were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $60 per pillow, however at the time, a "water bed pillow" for $60 just sounded silly.  What brought me back around to these pillows, was the year-long search that my wife and I had been on for the perfect pillows.  One of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows, which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow.  We spent a year, buying this pillow and that pillow, all to no avail.  Then one day I rolled the dice, and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers.  The covers actually make the dish.  These are the most comfortable pillows that I have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet!!!  These pillows rate 10 stars!!!  Just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had.  I do not work for, nor own this company, although after using their product I wish I did!!!  Our pillows are about three months old so far, and holding up exceptionally well.  They recommend you change the water every six months or so, depending on what type of water you put in.  The pillow is about half to three quarters cushion, with the water being the bottom layer.  They seal tight and do not leak. There is no audible sound from the water in the pillow, as if you follow the directions, they will instruct you on how to expel excess air.  These pillows and of those Black & Decker scissors, have to be my two best finds for 2006!!
