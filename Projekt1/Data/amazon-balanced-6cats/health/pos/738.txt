I bought this dryer based on other people's review.  It is an excellent dryer.  The air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers...however, since it dries my hair fast, my arms don't mind the weight. :)  2 thumbs up in my book!!
