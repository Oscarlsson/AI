For many years I Couldn't use a electric shaver because it was always a incomplete shave, so after each Christmas when I received a new one I would try it and would go back to a manual razor, THEN came along the freeglider and yippy it did a reasonable job that I would call satisfactory, the over the years That razor went obsolete so I started to look for a new replacement. I read some of the reviews. I read "the refills are costly  ... hello... 4$ a month?, then I read doesn't do a good job, Well let me report to you all this is the best darn razor, Its like magic each time I use it(cleans itself each time" its quick, comfortable , quiet, the cleaning process is so cool and I for one love the concept of a clean razor each time I use it, this razor is 10 times better then the freeglider which I loved, what a joy shaving now is , I can even shave twice (I go to work sometimes at 3am then later that night if I'm going out I can shave again and it doesn't irritate.. what a magical razor they have designed .. 

PS. The cleaning solution is not expensive (under 12$ for 3ea, that's 4$ apiece and lasts a month).

thank you to the designer 

I highly recommend this  2 thumbs up

cons

none I can see as yet .. John
