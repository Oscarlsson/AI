They had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and I stayed at and I fell in love with it! I HAD TO HAVE ONE OF MY OWN and thanks to Amazon I was able to find one. This is an EXCELLENT product. My husband installed it easily and I would never be without one again. One side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good, lol, and eyelining is a breeze. Though he would never admit it, my husband uses also (trimming mustash, nose hairs (eewww), shaving, etc.)
Great product. Order one. You will not be dissapointed!
