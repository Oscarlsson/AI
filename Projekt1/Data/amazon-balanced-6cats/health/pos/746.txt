Not a bad product.  Irritates the skin a little, but does remove your hair.  The only things I don't like is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back with in 2 weeks.  It does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and is great for hard to reach places.  Not a bad product; however, I hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away permanently or for a longer period of time.  I would recommend this product
