I ordered the HappyLite about 4 months before they even shipped the product, because it was the first reasonably priced (and sized) light to help treat SAD.  Living in Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time. I did not use it on weekends.
Anyway, I think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that helped the most.
I will indeed use the light again this winter, because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me
