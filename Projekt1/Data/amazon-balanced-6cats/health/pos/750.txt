I first used this product when I got a straight razor shave in a men's salon awhile back.  It really made for a smooth shave, which you definitely need when getting a straight razor shave.  By the way, I don't recommend getting a straight razor shave on your wedding day as I foolishly did.  Your face will be very sore.  It took me 10 years before I got another straight razor shave, and I hated it as much as the first time.  I'll never get another.  However, this oil product made the shave tolerable, and it makes daily shaving fantastic.  This combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave.  It's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward.  Buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave, and you won't be disappointed
