Purchased a case of Bally Energy Drink since I seemed a bit sluggish after a 12 hour work day and kept making excuses NOT to work out. Gets me up and at em' and no more excuses for not going for a long walk or trip to the gym! Drank 1 can in the morning @ 5:30 am and another around 3pm. Give it a try
