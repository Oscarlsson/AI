I got the WaterPik JP-130 to replace a shower head that was set too low for my husband.  Installation was easy enough, though, we had to purchase plumber's white tape to get a good seal.  Other showerheads I've purchased have come with the tape included which is why I took off one star.  The arm was long enough that my husband can step under it and still have clearance from the wall.  It creates a soft fall of water that I really enjoy and the head is large enough that I am actually able to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one tim.  I've not had any problems with the thumb screws and I have been move the unit quite often so that I can shave my legs.  I've loved this product so far and would definitely purchase again.
