My wife and I have used this a few times now and really like it.  From a novice's point of view, this is a great meditation aid.  I like being able to get the visual feedback as I calm and center myself.  I guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as I try to accomplish the task in front of me.  

It's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack
