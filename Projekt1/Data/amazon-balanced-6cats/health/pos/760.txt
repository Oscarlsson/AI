I got this showerhead for Christmas and am really happy with it!!  It's really a pleasant experience to have the water raining down on you.
I do agree with the other reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in place.  But with mine anyways it stays in place while I'm using it and it's only later that it slowly lowers down.  Then I just move it back into place and tighten the knobs again when I want to use it.  It hasn't been any trouble so far.
I love this showerhead so much that I'm actually already looking for an even larger one!!  I highly recommend these "rainfall" showerheads!
