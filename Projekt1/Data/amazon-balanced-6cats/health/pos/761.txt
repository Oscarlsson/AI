Pik Stik reacher/grabber did exactly what it said.  I used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor and in the yard.  I'm 5'4" and did not have to bend over to pick up things.  It picks up coins, small pieces of paper, as well as jars, and leaves/gumballs from outdoors. I am completely satisfied
