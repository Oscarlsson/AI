I had a horrible cold, felt like complete #### but I HAD to work. This little two ounce vitamin B shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and I was able to get some work done. There really is no crash and the taste isn't that bad. ..it tastes like a melted freeze pop.

NOTE: It may give you the jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach
