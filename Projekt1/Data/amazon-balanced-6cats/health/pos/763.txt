Im a truck driver that dosent drink coffee. Can you believe it!?
My hours are really weird as my day may start at 8AM or at 8PM & I might work for 10 to 14 hours per shift. Ive used half a bottle to a full bottle at a time & have always gotten the boost I need to get where Im going. I also may use it to start my day or to finish it. 
I started using 5 hour about 6 months ago. I dont use it everyday but when I need it, it works well. The nice thing is, when I finally call it a day I can lay down & get to sleep. Unlike other products Ive used, I dont have that ragged feeling afterward.
I purchase in quantities of 100 & carry 25 or so on the road.
