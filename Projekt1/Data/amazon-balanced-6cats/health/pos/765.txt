I have owned and broken most grabbers on the market. The fold-up Gopher is a joke, another, with a flimsy wire down the center breaks after too much use, and the heavy-duty unit from Lowes is hard on the wrist. This unit is the smart way to go! It is strong and durable and makes the most sense in the way it utilizes the strength of the hand and fingers and relieves pressure from the wrist. Also, it is exactly the correct length for a six foot man. No bending at the lumbar required
