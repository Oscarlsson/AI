My mother in law thought it was reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these because she got one that has ocean sounds... birds.. ect. But all those other machines have that creepy digital sound for white noise...and the waves inevitably break and the birds stop chirping as soon as the car alarm goes off in the street. This is the only sound we need! 
We bought it for our 3 month old daughter because we live in a noisy part of the city and our neighbors kept waking her up. She slep great from day one... now we use it as part of her bedtime ritual.. bath, jammies, book, SLEEPY MACHINE... and off to sleep she goes
