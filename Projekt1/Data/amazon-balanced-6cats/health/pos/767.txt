We originally got this to replace the "fan noise" in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold.  The first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it.  We've discovered it's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night.  With the adjustability dials it's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan.  It doesn't however, cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise, especially for children
