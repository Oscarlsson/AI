This is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone.  The biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem, maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use!  Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments).

That said the interface etc. needs help, it can be downright frustrating, and the relatively low-res graphics can be a strain on some screens.  Thankfully these issues have been addressed in the expansion pack Wisdom Quest, which I also highly recommend.  Overall, this is a really innovative and great product.  Also a good investment as far as biofeedback devices go since there will likely be more expansion packs and third-party software to come
