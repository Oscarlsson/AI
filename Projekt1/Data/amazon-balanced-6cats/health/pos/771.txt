I purchased this size ramp to handle wheelchair access over the two-inch threshold to our house and it has done that, but I wish now that I had selected a size longer than 16 inches in order to have a more gradual incline. I use a power wheelchair with plenty of power but have found that the chair's direction becomes a little unstable when it reaches the top of the ramp due to the slope, necessitating careful maneuvering to continue in a straight line into the house. It was easy to install, however, with the included mounting screws and seems sturdy and durable
