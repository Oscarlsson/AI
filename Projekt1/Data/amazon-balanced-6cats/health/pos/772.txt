My hair is very wavy and frizzy, I have to condition my hair every day so it doesn't look dry and damaged. 2 weeks ago I got my hair cut, the stylist used a Sedu straightener on me. Wow! Suddenly, my hair was stick straight and super glossy (really brought out the natural highlights). I bought one from him for $199 (should have checked the Internet first). 

I've tried a cheap flat iron before; after wrestling with it for 40 minutes and pulling the heck out of my hair, all I got was slightly "pressed" hair. 

The Sedu iron has super smooth ionic plates, so it glides through your hair very easily, quickly and smoothly. No more pulling of my hair. I can give myself smooth, gorgeous, in about 5 minutes. Another plus is that the style will stay until the next time you wash your hair; Now i only have to straighten my hair every other day. 

Sure, Sedu is on the expensive side, but this salon-quality tool is more than worth it. Look good and feel good every day!
