I read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the Sedu.  It took me a week to get the product and I anxiously tried it as soon as it arrived.  I must say that the products is a dream come true.  I am an African American woman and I have never been able to get my hair as straight as I am able to do now, not even when going to the salon.  When I went back to work from the weekend, my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked (because it was truly straight).  I would recommend this to any woman.  I have not been back to the salon in the last 2 months
