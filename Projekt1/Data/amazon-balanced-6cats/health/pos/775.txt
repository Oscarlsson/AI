Calvin Klein's Obsession was one of the earliest releases in the designer fragrance craze, and it has since become a classic.  Obsession is a warm, earthy, sensual scent.  There is no floral or sweetness to it; rather, it has a musky, almost masculine quality with a bit of a vanilla note.  The scent is gently seductive--alluring enough for romance, but also subtle enough for everyday wear.  In has excellent staying power, as it lingers on the skin all day long.

Although Obession has all of the qualities I usually like in a fragrance--I definitely prefer musky, spicy scents to more floral ones--for some reason, Obsession is not one of my favorites; although I do enjoy wearing it on occasion, I actually prefer stealing some of my husband's Obession for Men to wear for myself!  Overall, however, Obsession for women is a classic fragrance that I would definitely recommend
