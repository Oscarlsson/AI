I've been using this for the last 3 months and I'm a very satisfied customer. I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors. I'm Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown   hair problems. I highly recommend this, because it's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic. It's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil. I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber. When he used clippers on me I've never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers. I'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming
