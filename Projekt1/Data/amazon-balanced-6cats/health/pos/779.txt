I was having a problem with over-eating and eating when I wasn't hungry and as a result, gained quite a bit of weight, and felt awful.

I've only been using this product for three days, but already my portion size has shrunk immensely and my energy is way up.  I haven't felt jittery or shaky.  I feel better than I have in months.

I would recommend this to those who also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop some un-needed weight
