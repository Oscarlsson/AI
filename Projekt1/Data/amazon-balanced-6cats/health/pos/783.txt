I bought this Obus Forme king sized pillow because I thought it might stop my snoring.  I must admit to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night time rattling if not eliminate it completely.  

There have been reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first.  I found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new carpet or some plastics, but that disappeared in just a few days and was never offensive.

My wife wanted to try my pillow and liked it so much she kept it.  I have just ordered a second pillow.
