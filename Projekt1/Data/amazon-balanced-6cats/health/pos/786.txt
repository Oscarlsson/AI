I bought this straightner at Walmart for about the same price found on amazon and I really like it.  I bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does.  I wanted a chi, but I couldn't pass this one up for the price.  I 've only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well.  A good product for the price!!
