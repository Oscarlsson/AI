NV diet pills are working great for me- I lost 8lbs in a month!!! they work as long as you eat healthy and exercise regularly while taking the pills. It isn't a miracle pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and don't work out, of course nothing is going to happen. They really do control hunger because I take 2 a day and one day I was busy and forgot to take my 2nd pill and I was STARVING looking to eat anything and everything in sight
