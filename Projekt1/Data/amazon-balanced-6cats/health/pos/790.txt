Having struggled with digital scales that broke after a few years, I finally decided to get the scale my doctor has.  It's terrific because I can see it clearly (the numbers are right in my face) and it is built to last forever! My daughter and I assembled it with a minimum of effort. The directions are written clearly and all adjustments are super easy to handle. It is clearly the best scale I've ever owned.  The down side is that it needs a bit more space than a regular floor scale.  You can, however, buy a piece of plywood and put the scale on top of the wood in a carpeted room if your bathroom can't handle the bigger size
