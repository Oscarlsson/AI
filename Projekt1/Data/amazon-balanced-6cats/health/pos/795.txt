I read in one of the magazines, that many stars in Hollywood eat chocolate
to lose weight. I thought, that was some kind of cruel joke, until I read
that the chocolate they eat is with hoodia, but I could not find the name
for those chocolates.
I searched the internet, and was I happy to find Chocoleans!
I was going out on a date to my favorite sushi place, and had one  chocolean
before I left the house.
It worked! I could barely finish two sushi's  and I felt soo full.
Now I  eat one or two chocoleans a day with water or coffee, and eat soo
much less!
I already lost two dress sizes, amazing.
And, they are sooo delicious
