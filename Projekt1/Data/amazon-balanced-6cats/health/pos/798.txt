These are the best diapers I have used. They are soft, flexible, and easily adjustable for a good secure fit. They hold leaks extremely well. Of course leaks do occur (why wouldn't they if your baby has, say for example, 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes....it's happened), however this is to be expected. They do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy, but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection. I HIGHLY recommend these
