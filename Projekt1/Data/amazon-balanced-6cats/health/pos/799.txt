The magnet is solid, the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows.  Lenses are clear and functional.  However, they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads, since it can get snug and this is NOT your usual glasses.  Notice that the frame encircles the head, making head size an issue.

On the plus side- the glasses won't fall off when you bend forward, they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em, and they are functional
