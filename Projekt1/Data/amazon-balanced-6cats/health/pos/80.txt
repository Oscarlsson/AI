This is a very good shaver for the private area.  However, the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first.  This will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work.  The foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long.

The only problem I had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed.  However, I use the 'mangroomer' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle.  it is a great product as well.

Therefore, I would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men's grooming on the body.  I would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results
