I had my original clic readers for about six years before I had to replace them. I love the quality of the lenses, the ease of use and the fact that I do not have to remember where I put them when I took them off. I never take them off and have even  ordered several pair for other people at work. I am a carpenter and other than having to clean sawdust that accumulates on them once in a while, find them to be one  of the most useful tools I own.
