omgosh i cannot tell you how much i love this straightener. it makes my hair SO SOFT its like baby bottom soft or when u sand wood for a really really long time. i LOVE it. i use it everymorning.. at night i use the wet setting to dry off my hair and then in the mroning i finish it off with the dry settting. but i also use sunsilk pink bottle 24/7 creme. its an absolute must-have. 
to the person who gave it one star.. maybe yours was a defect. im sure everyone else who has rated it so far loved it. did you straighten it section by section? it doesnt work if you do it all at once. 

i recommend this straightener! its not that expensive and also makes a great christmas gift. looks nice too.

enjoy
