I've been relying on this lotions for over a decade.  Of the many I've tried, it's the only one that provides both immediate dryness relief and long-lasting moisturizing.  Some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be excessive, especially on hands, but if you have skin as dry as mine you'll tolerate a minute or two of "greasiness" for the softness and comfort that lasts for hours.  These comments are for Neutrogena Emulsion only -- Neutrogena Body Lotion did not work well for me
