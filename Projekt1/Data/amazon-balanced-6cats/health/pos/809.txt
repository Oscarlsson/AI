Over the past two years I have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs. At age 70 those needs are many. After approximately two rounds of trying, it is Miracle Greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs I have for feeling better in general
