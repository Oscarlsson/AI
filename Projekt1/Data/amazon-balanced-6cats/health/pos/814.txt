This isn't a product thats going to get you laid after she sniffs it a couple of times. It's starts the chat and dialog.   What it does do is start the conversation and keep you the their target. M-11 kicks up the yackity yak in her with you being the focus. I;ve tried a few of them including that 90 dollar rip off thats advertised in Popular Science, and this is  product works just fine. Give it a go guys. It gets you past that awkward dork moment when you are trying to talk about somthing other that what Starbucks you hang at. Its not a sex pill so forget it. But, it will open up the road you need to walk down to get to the garden of eden or whatever. So don't be a little whimp. Be a man and give it a go. Its a way to the women you want via the mental route. Yes, you have to think. It will work for you so do it
