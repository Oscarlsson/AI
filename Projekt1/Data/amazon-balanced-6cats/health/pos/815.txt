I wanted a cordless shaver because at my age (49) I need my glasses on to see the hairs I'm shaving, and that doesn't work well in the shower!  This Braun is a good buy, easy to use, and works well if you follow the directions and shave slowly.  It's not as close or smooth as a blade and shaving gel, but it's quicker and less mess, so I think it's a good trade-off.
