The Ultrasonic Aromatheropy Fountain is really unique.  The sound generated, yet unheard, causes water to spring up from the surface 3-4 inches to provide a fountain-like water sound. At the same time, the frequency of the sound waves create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides and out along the surface it is sitting on. All the while, led lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors.  The construction was just a little light duty other than that, Very Nice
