Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  Because of its design, best results are obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and the procedure repeated.  Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  It works better when clean.

The main PLUS of this product is its size.  Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would probably sell for $2.50 if it didn't say Panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty.  But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available
