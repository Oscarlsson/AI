I really like this curling iron...- and you definitely can't beat the price!  It heats up very quickly, and gives me great curls.  The key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair.  Then, after you curl, make sure to take a blowdryer on cold/low setting to lock the curls down.  I always receive so many compliments on my hair!!
