I am a big fan of 2" curling irons, but they can be difficult to find.  My last one (different brand) wore out a couple years ago and I had a hard time finding a replacement until now.
I have shoulder length hair, fairly thick, plus wavy and frizzy.  2" curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair, while also turning it under (or up, if desired) at the ends for a nice, finished look.  I find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat/straight iron while achieving superior results.  You will not get "curl" with this curling iron.  You will get smooth hair quickly and easily.  Highly recommended
