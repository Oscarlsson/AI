I was searching for a two inch curling iron for a while. I have had so -so dealings with Gold N Hot in the past so I was a little nervous but I purchased this one anyway. So far, so good. It's surprisingly light (at least compared to my one inch ceramic tools curling iron). I usually let my hair air dry and use my curling irons to straighten my hair as I curl the ends (I'm black with a relaxer.) I have yet to do it with this one. Although I might try b/c it gets really hot. (I usually have it on around 20-25 out of 30)

The only problem is that the ceramic can chip off (It happened with the first one I bought, but I returned it and got a new one that hasn't chipped so far) and it's so big that if you take your thumb off the spring grip, it can be hard to get it back on (I have huge hands too.
