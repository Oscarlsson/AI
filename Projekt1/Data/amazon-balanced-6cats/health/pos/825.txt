Sedamine is great sleep aid. I've been dealing with no sleep problems for about 8 months and I tried nearly everything including old remedies-I thought I would go crazy if I didn't find help. Not sleeping has been awful. Since end of July I started with the Sedamine product and it started working right way. I tell anyone to try it cause it help me it help anyone.
