the pills really do work.  I stopped taking stacker over a year ago and i stopped my routine workouts and i gained 40 lbs in just one year!  I was so frustrated and dissapointed at myself so i started going to the gym but i was finding it hard to motivate myself to do anything while at the gym.  I just started taking stacker3 for one week and already i have dropped almost 10 lbs (of course with excersise as well)  This pill not only helps with energy but as i have read, it also works as a metabolism enhancing property! Thank you NVE for a great product.  THe only negative thing about it is that i sometimes feel dizzy and a numbness to my fingers.  (that was the reason i stopped taking it in the first place but its really not life threatening or as serious as it may sound)
