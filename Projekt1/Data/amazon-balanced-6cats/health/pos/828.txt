We have a "closet shower", which made it difficult to get out of the way of the water spray (not to mention having water spray out the door).  We picked up this neat little shower head, and we're much happier now.  You can avoid the water more easily (for shaving, washing body, etc.), and since it aims straight down, no more turning the shower head all the way to the side to avoid it going right out the door.  It's inexpensive, and has made our shower experience much better.  I definitely recommend it
