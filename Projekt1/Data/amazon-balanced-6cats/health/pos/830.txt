Wow!  I'm really impressed!  I've had trouble cleaning under my bridge.  I can fish floss under there and clean it good, but it takes a lot of time.  Now I just blast it clean in minutes.  It does a good job of cleaning my back teeth.  I've never been totally satisfied with just flossing.  Now they feel perfectly clean.  I love this device!  It doesn't replace flossing.  It does a great job under the gums, but I still feel cleaner after flossing.  It's great as a between brushing "touchup".  I recommend it to anyone.  My mouth hasn't felt this clean in years.  I feel like I've come from the Dentist after a cleaning.  Thats a great feeling to have every day
