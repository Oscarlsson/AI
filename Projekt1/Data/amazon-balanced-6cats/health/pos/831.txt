This was my first purchase of Seventh Generation products and it won't be my last one.  I was very impressed with the cleaning and it is just as good as those not so earth friendly competitors.  I feel good using their products and have also ordered their fabric softner, dishwasher liquid, dishwashing liquid, bleach, paper towels, and toilet paper.  I'm not a treehugger but do care about my environment and feel a duty to make earth a better place to be
