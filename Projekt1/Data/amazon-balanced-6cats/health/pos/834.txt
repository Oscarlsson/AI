I found this product to be very unique, and helpful, in that I could quickly remove & retain the glasses around my neck.

Being far-sighted, I have come to need reading glasses, and these are perfect for my needs.  I can look 'down' through them, and look 'over the frame' for distance, all while they are secured around my head and neck.

I do hiking, using a GPS device, and these glasses allow me to look down at the GPS device in my hand, while also looking forward towards my path of travel.

Thank you for the innovative product
