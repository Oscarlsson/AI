My husband was totally delighted with the Rollator Walker.  It is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone wouldn't want this new, much more attractive kind.  It folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things.  When folded up it fits in the back seat of our car, and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large.  We put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great, what more can you ask
