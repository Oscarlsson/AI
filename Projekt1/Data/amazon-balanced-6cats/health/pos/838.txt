I ordered this walker for my father a few months ago and am well-pleased.  It is much less expensive than comparable walkers.  The cushioned seat and basket are handy for long "trips" and the wheels roll smoothly even over grassy areas.  A good buy for someone looking for a quality walker.  Even ships for free
