Yes, the kit is easy to use, but if you don't bleed freely, get a few extra lancets before you start. Most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free. The kit only comes with two (which can be used only one time). It took me 6 jabs to get enough blood for the test; I had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets (because I'm too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool). Other than that - no complaints. The lab got the results back to me faster than expected
