these wipes are great.  i have three children and have used the pampers, huggies, and house-brand wipes.  the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done. house-brand don't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough.  the pampers are thin, soft, and moist enough to get the job done-because they are thin, they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded / refolded for 100% useage (unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver).  definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said.  if you want something moister, go get a paper towel and wet it with water
