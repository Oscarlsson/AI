I have three types of headlamps and I like this one the most.

Here is why: 1) it's cheap, 2) it runs a long time on three AAA batteries, and 3) the red light is awesome. 

You can use the red light and still keep your "night vision". I use it to read in bed becasue it is not as visible or distracting to others as a white light.

My only problem with it is that the knobs are a little confusing, even after two years of use. I often have to twist twice to get the right setting. And I'm usually good at that stuff
