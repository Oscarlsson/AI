These bars are supposed to be for Women because they are lower cal and have more calcium.  I think there are other factors as well.  Men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough, but they say that they need calcium and protein too.  I really like the key lime flavor it is great.  I like lemon also and the chi tea.  I like those flavors because they are light tasting and I do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do.  The lime reminds me of the florida keys.  These are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out I did not eat another man ciff bar.  I used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when I had a busy life.  Thankfully my life has slowed down now.  It is good grab and go food
