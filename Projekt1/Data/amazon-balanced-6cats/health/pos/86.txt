After reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the Luna Bar flavors, I decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself. I noticed that the Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil. If you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor. The toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious, doesn't taste like a candy bar, and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages. Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market.
