As a reviewer of the Hitachi Magic Wand, I can say that this Accuvibe seems just as adaquate to do the job, the plus is that this can be used with or without the power cord. Perhaps just not as powerfull as the Hatachi but pretty dam comparable if not the same, the cordless battery operation is worth the trade off. As mentioned it does the job
