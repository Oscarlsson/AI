Old Spice Classic is far and away the best deodorant I've ever used. It goes on clean, unlike those "powdery" white deodorants. It also has a great fragrance and longevity after application. I think a lot of that is due to the high alcohol content; if you look at the ingredients, you'll see that alcohol is listed first. In fact, the container sports a "flammable" warning. The alcohol really does work well to contain odor. Alcohol-based deodorants are pretty hard to find, so I'm thankful this product is still being made
