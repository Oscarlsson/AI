Recently got my SleepMate and it is very effective.  Somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom, and I don't have any trouble sleeping.  I use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night, and have the hardest time getting back to sleep.  I hardly ever wake up at all now.

Great product, and I'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night's sleep
