After going back and forth between Oil of Olay and Neutrogena I settled on this product mostly because of the price (plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes.) I'm happy with the results- my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity. The orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes (I do it in the shower.) Of course, it's not microdermabrasian, but it is a great exfolliater for your skin
