We used this for my newborn daughter up until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently.  As a previous reviewer stated, sometimes it works, sometimes not, so I combined it with the recommended dosage for Infant Gas Drops and that would do the trick.  I found Little Tummy's brand at Babies-R-Us, which is less expensive and is the same thing.  

Later, after 6 months and trying new foods, there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something didn't agree with her.  I gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she'd clearly feel better
