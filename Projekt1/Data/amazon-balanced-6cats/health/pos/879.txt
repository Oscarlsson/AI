Delivers moist heat. Great large size. You won't find anything larger anywhere.VERY relaxing as lavender is calming.
Only problem is it only stay warm enough for 10 min and heat really should be applied for 20 minutes.
I have placed a heating pad underneath in it the last 10 min. and lied down with head & neck in comfortable position and it did a great job. 
Pricey but worth it
