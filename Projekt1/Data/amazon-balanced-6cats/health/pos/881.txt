  I found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings.  Keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results.  The size of the cuff is very important, so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results.  This is true in the doctors office also.  My blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office, on his machine, just by changing the size of the cuff.
   This is an excellent monitor - I couldn't be happier with it.  It is nice to be able to use it with batteries too.
