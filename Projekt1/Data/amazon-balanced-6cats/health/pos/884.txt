I've used this for quite some time now and really like it.  I don't have the trouble with the toilet flushing that others seem to - but I suppose if you have one of those one-gallon regulated toilets, you'd probably have some trouble with this paper.  It is thicker and tons softer, but it does a wonderful job too on things like runny noses, running cat's eyes, cleaning the bathroom sink, mirror, you name it.  It's pretty strong stuff and I highly recommend it
