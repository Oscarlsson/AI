I've been using Remington's Shaver Saver for 20 years. It keeps your shaver clean, lubricates well with not too much gooey oil, and works in an instant. I use a Remington MS2-100 Microscreen 2, and after a Shaver Saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer. A treatment seems to last for a while and I don't think it's necessary to use it every day. Usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new
