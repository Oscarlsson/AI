like the product very much. comfortable and convenient.  i would recommend then if: you have a small hat size, don't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag.  with the above i don't have a problem.  the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed, goggle like eye pieces on warm days.  i've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye, but have not done this as of jan,2007. i like them very innovative
