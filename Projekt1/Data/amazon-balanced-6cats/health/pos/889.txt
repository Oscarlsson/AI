I have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued (like I could hardly move).  I had been taking a general multi-vitamin from a local warehouse store.  I started taking the Nature's Plus Source of Life, and I felt so much better.  My energy level has increased dramatically, and I just feel good.  Great quality product
