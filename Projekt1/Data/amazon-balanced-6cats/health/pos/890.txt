Nearly two years of ownership and it has been a great purchase. I have no shame dorking up my drinking. Use to ensure legal driving or for ill advised contests. Also determine what at what BAC memory gets spotty (what point is there exceeding that?). Fun to call out big talkers who don't suspect you are packing a lie detector of sorts. Also useful to get people off your back who think you are too drunk to drive.

Pros
precision to third decimal place. rare at this price at time of my purchase

Very repeatable with consistant deep breath

Small enough to take to bars in jacket pocket or cargo pockets. Light for its size.

Cons
Innaccurate if sips have been taken within 10 minutes or so. True for all breathalyzers. Drunk idiots have tough time getting it through their heads

Warm up/calibration time ~45 sec. Another let down at parties but perhaps key to accuracy

Would be nice if it was more pocket sized

Chirps at you alarm clock style if above .08 "I know I'm drunk, shut up!
