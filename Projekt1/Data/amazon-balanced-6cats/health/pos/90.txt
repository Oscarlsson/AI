This baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure. We're yet to verify what the culprit is... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch.

I would highly recommend this guy if you're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor. It's been consistant, reliable, and informative for both myself and my doctor
