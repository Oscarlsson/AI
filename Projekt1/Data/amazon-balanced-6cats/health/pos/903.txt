It took a while to get this product but, it was worth the wait. The iron heats up quickly and easily. When you have arthritis like me, you appreciate the simplicities in this product. It heated up fast and safely AND it was so easy to grip the handle. It definitely styled my hair without over-processing it. Thanks
