Optimum Nutrition's 100% whey protein is hands down the best I have tried, and I have tried a lot of different shake products in the past 10 years. I used to be committed to EAS and Labrada, but I found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to ON Whey Protein. 

I mix it with water, and sometimes soy milk. It mixes easy, doesn't taste gritty, and is pure protein. It goes down very easy and I have no trouble digesting it, plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan. Plus, the price is reasonable.
