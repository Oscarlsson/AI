I am a former General Nutrition Center employee and there are hundreds of "powdered" protein products that "hype" about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out. if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick, bloated or passing gas, then you need to trust in Optimum Nutritions 100% Whey Protein. It truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes. 
I strongly recommend 2% milk over water for even better taste, but water will still do the trick. If you buy Vanilla, i suggest mixing it with berries, bananas, strawberries, or bananas for added taste. 
this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is worth more for your money
