I have been using this stuff regularly for about 10 months post workout & for meal replacement to keep up protein intake. I read alot about mixing whey with coconut water & that is how I have been taking it (blended with a couple ice cubes). If you like strawberry shakes this will be really easy for you to take, I do & I actually look forward to the shake
