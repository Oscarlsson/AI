If I could give this product over five stars, I would!  I get eczema on my eyelid and went through tons of products trying to find something to soothe it when I finally got this product in one of the starter kits Burt's Bees makes and I was hooked.  I use this with their marshmallow vanishing cream and my skin feels and looks great.  I have also noticed a decrease in the dark circles I always have when I use the royal jelly cream, though that could just be relief from no more eczema problems
