I am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of Clics I own.  
If you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect.
Their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on!  I'd 
look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer.
Lastly ~ I've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use
