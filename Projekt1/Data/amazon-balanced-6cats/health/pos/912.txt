I started using this several months ago after seeing it chosen as the best by Consumer's Report.  Within a few weeks, I could see measurable improvement in my skin.  Sure, not all the deep wrinkles went away, but enough of the smaller ones smoothed away so my 58-year-old skin looks younger.
My skin feels so much smoother and looks fresh.  I've had a lot of sun exposure from living in Australia, South Texas and Florida, so I'm thrilled to find a cream that does such a good job.  Lots cheaper too than many skin creams
