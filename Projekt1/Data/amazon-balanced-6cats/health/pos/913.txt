My grandmother actually gave me a small sample of regenerist. I started to use it and fell in love with it. I have suffered with acne my entire life and I have found combining this along with my salicylic acid treatment my skin has improved drastically. I have since purchased a bottle of the regenerist serum that had a sample of regenerist night. These both seem to be making my skin clear up and be much smoother for applying cosmetics, which has been a problem due to my skin texture
