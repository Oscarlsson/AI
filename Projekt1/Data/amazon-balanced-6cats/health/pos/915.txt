I bought this item for my husband for Christmas.  He has hip and knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him.  We use these pillows everyday sitting up watching TV and he uses the head and knee wedges while he sleeps.  The only downfall now is that he sleeps so good he snores!
