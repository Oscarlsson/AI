great product, easy to use and simple to follow instruction, keeps me in the zone to burn calories while on my walks.  i recommend it to anyone.    it doesnt interface with gym exercise equipment but i dont use them anyway and it doesnt cost 3 to 4 times what one of those do.  buy it, wear it, be happy
