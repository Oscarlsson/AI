This contains 16 servings, which means it will last you half a month.  That's pretty expensive when you break the price down by serving and whne compared with a 1 month supply of the flax capsules that costs $7.  However, liquid flax oil is a lot more concentrated than the pills you buy at the store.  
A flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg of flaxseed oil and a suggested dosage of 2-3 times a day.  So with pills you're getting 2-3g of flax oil a day.  With liquid flax oil, you're getting 14g of flax.  

If you are buying this for it's purported treatment of acne, sunburn, diverticular disorders, hemorrhoids, and more serious health conerns, it's probably best to consume the liquid flax oil.  If you just want the benefits of lower cholesterol and heart disease prevention, a pill a few times a day, combined with fish oil should be all you need.

It's definitely easier though to take a spoonful of this in the morning than 3 flax pills a day, and when you loook at value, you're getting 224g of flax oil in this bottle when compared with a typical 100g in a 100 pill bottle of the capsules.  It all depends on what you need it for
