Loving this Air Purifier! This was really the first one I have own so I can't compare it to any others. It is very quite, and takes alot of dust out of the air. The first time I had to replace the filter I was shocked by how much dust I could of been breathing in. Worth picking up, just wish it would of had an energy star label.
