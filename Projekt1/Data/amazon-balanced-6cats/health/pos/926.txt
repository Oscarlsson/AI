My youngest daughter has had mild to severe asthma for 32 years and has had to use an inhaler almost on a daily basis.  I bought her this product to use in her new house as she was having severe asthma attacks from dust, mold, pollen, ect.  She has been using this product for three (3) months now and she has not had to use her inhaler a single time.  We have used several other brands and types of air cleaners in the past twenty years but none have proven as effective as this product.  Highly recommeded
