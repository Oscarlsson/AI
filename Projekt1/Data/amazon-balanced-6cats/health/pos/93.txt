I have had Omord HR-100C for a few months now. I use it wile on my treadmill. It seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate; I think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin. I did have some trouble with the unit when I first started using it; I replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem. The fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons I picked the Omord brand. The HR-100C is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor
