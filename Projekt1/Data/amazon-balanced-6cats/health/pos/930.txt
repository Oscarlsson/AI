I'm a black male and everytime I would shave normally I would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs. At first i'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day I'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads (about 10-20 of them). That was  before. Now after I apply the product I don't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore. It just feels like I never had any hair on my face in the first place. The only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but I don't really care I mean it's not like the product claims to be painless.
