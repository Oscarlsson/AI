I've used this razor for about 2 yrs.  For me and my wife, it gives me a great close shave.  I've never had a problem with skin irritation.  Just how hard are these other guys pressing the razor on their face?!  I can't imagine.  I only need the lightest pressure to get a good shave.  The shave is fast, about 2 mins.  The dual blade design (each of the three heads has two rows of blades!) is awesome, makes the shave clean and fast.  I'll probably stick with Remington rotories from now on, but will upgrade to a corded/cordless.

My problems with it are:

Can't use with cord if the battery dies (didn't know this when I bought it)
The gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache hair gets in, which requires turning it off and back on again.

Otherwise, it's a great solid razor
