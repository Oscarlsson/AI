I have used Opti-Free Enzymatic Cleaner for years, still with the same great results. I have a feeling this type of product won't be around much longer, because my using extended-wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist's office, where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock
