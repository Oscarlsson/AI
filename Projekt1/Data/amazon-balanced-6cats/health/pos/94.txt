Great product for the $ I spent.  I picked it b/c I can replace the batteries myself and the cost was in my budget.  It does jump around more than I'd like, but I can tell from the range that I am over or under my target heart rate.  It does beep to let you know that, but I find it annoying so I turn it off.  If you find you have trouble getting it to register your rate, then move it around a bit.  Mine works best when I put it higher on my chest, in the area of my heart, just below my shoulder blade.
