This product is great for injury and leg elevation.  My grandmother had a hematoma on her leg and she said that her "legs don't fall asleep anymore and they feel so good."  My grandmother has had two strokes and this is just the relief that she needs.  My mother has fibromayalgia and I'm ordering two for her as well.  She "test-drove" them before giving a set to my grandmother and this will be a great holiday gift for her
