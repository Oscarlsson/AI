I am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because I constantly burn.  I have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied.  I went on my honeymoon to the Maldives in November and was able to stay out in the sun, go swimming and I did not have to constantly reapply.  I didn't get burned once!  Bull Frog Superblock is the best sunblock around
