Have used this product on myself for many years when particapating in ultra endurance cycling events, as well as on my family when vacationing in tropical area's where the sun will cook you quickly without adequate sun protection. Do not be fooled by thinking you will not get tanned by using  SPF 45 or better. That is a misconception...why not walk away from your experience in the sun without the discomfort of sun poisoning. Found best result's when put on indoors prior to being in the sun.
