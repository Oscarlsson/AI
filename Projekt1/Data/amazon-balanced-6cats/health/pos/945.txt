I am a biochemist by education and was a teaching in physiology in a university.  As such, I am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general.  I really like Neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality.  For most people, I think it offers great protection, but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer.

According to my dermatologist, recent studies have shown that SPF 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and doesn't offer adequate protection after that time.  This is partly due to most people not using enough.  In other words, they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection.

For this reason, Neutrogena SPF 45 or 55 is better.  Also, the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer products have been updated to include a technology called Helioplex.  Most dermatologists that I know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important.

I have used both this product and the higher SPF Helioplex formulations.  In practice, I have found BOTH adequate for my needs.  What I particularly like is that you don't even know you have the product on.  It has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you can't even notice it.  Both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use, but my understanding is that the Helioplex formulation is even better.  Further, it feels exactly the same on the skin.  The only drawback is it's a bit more expensive.

This is also a good product because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  Both are implicated in skin cancer and it's important to protect yourself against both.  If you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one.  However, if you want the very best protection try the Neutrogena Helioplex SPF 55.  This will give you the most peace of mind
