i had reasently bought this vibrator because i like trying out did kinds of vibrators to get more pleasure from and well i would have to say this one and my magic wand vibrator, well i like this one better because it is cordless so i can use it anywhere in my home even away from an outlet like in my car and no cord gets in the way. it also has a very flexable soft head that feels really very good when i use it. it has really strong motor that can make me have some exteme orgasms that fell very good. and last it looks to be made very well so it probly will last pretty long i hope so.
