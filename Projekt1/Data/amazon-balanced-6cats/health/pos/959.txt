Shavers fall into two categories, those who prefer rotaries like the Norelco and those who prefer foil shavers. 

For those of you who like foil shavers, this is the one for you! 

I've owned the latest Braun 8985 and it was excellent, while it lasted... The charger kept breaking on me (once in the first month [11/2006], then another time 4 months later [3/2007]). It was expensive, and the refills were a pain, pricey, but they worked.

After two exchanges I decided to try the norelco 8140XL (speed XL)rotaries, and while they shaved really close, they tore up my neck. The problem only got worse. Returned 3 weeks later.

I just got the Panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors. They shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos.

I'm not sure if I like the "side to side" pivoting head, only time will tell. The heads don't pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once again, time will tell if this is necessary.

One MAJOR advantage is that it cleans with soap and water... No expensive refills to hassle over.

The panasonic has two noticeable downsides:

1. It's louder than other shavers, but who cares? It shaves incredibly fast anyway.

2. You can't plug it in and shave... You have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on.



This is my favorite razor by far.
