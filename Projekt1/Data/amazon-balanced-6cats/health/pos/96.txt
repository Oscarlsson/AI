Now that I'm writing this review, it seems silly that I'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush.  But I am.  I bought this item not long after I had my first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago, something which I never again want to experience in my life (as someone else described, it was painful and expensive).  Growing up, I didn't take care of my teeth like I should've, so I'm accustomed to always being told there's either a cavity, or the start of one, and having to have more work done.  

After the root canal, my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations, because that's what she'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums.  This specific item met those requirements, and it was affordable.  When I first started using it, my gums were very sensitive to it, but that quickly wore off, so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums.  It is also MUCH easier to get behind the front teeth.  Subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one (I honestly don't remember if she has this exact model, but ours are similar), and I've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since I purchased it.

As far as cleaning the unit to keep it from "gunking" up, I'm the only person who uses this item, so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in, not dripping into the storage container; so I don't know how to combat that.  But I just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it, then rinse the hand-held part, and set them back on the unplugged charger/base (I only plug it in when the battery runs low) and things stay clean with no problem
