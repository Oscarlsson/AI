This is the 2nd year that I have used the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 45.  I have Normal to Oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I am fair and can burn easily.

I think this product is well worth the money, it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel.  It does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out.  I apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours.  The time will vary depending on your sun tolerance, though.  It is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile
