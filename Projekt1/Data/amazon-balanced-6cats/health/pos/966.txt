I got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress.  It was pretty pungent, but it felt so good the first time I layed in it.  after a couple days it appeared to lose it's memory and start to dent and crease, but eventually it got back to full expansion.  The customer service with this item was fantastic!

We'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory
