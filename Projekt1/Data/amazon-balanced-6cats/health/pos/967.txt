When I get a sinus infection, it stays and builds much congestion. Rx and over-the-counter has limited value. One event that led to my first (I am 69) severe asthma event, which messed up my immune system and led to my first angina events which the brought open heart surgury.

NeilMed pre-mixed packets sound like the "minor leagues" compared to the above. When a thorough cleansing is needed to make the sinus areas hostile to infection, these little packets take the mess out of measuring your own salt and soda(i.e. to make a mistake is painful even with the right salt).

Then there is a $15 price in local stores for 100 packets, or about the same on-line for 200. Also a quick response from the vendor.
