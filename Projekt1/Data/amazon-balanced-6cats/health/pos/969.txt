Bought 2 of these 3 years ago on QVC for my husband and myself.  I was pregnant with my second son and going to get waxed at the nail shop, where it smelled like nail polish remover, was just too much for me at the time.  We love these shavers and they work just as well today as they did 3 years ago!  I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, I get an incredibly close shave with this.  To be honest, and maybe a little too personal, I haven't waxed my upper lip since, I only use this!  There is NO stubble, NO pain and great results!  I have dark hair, and if this in anyway made me look like I shaved, I would never use it!  I am buying 2 more for back up.  I hope they never stop making these!!
