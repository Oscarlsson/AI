I've tried a lot of different "nutrition" and "energy" bars, and these are my favorites (along with a couple of other chocolate ZonePerfect bars like Double Chocolate and Chocolate Raspberry). Great taste, a nice texture (sort of like Nestle Crunch), and much more satisfying than candy bars.  Almost as tasty as Girl Scout "Thin Mints", but not as fat- and guilt-inducing
