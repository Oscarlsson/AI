My 16-year-old daughter used this on problem acne on her back and shoulders with noticeable results by the second day - existing blemishes healed, no new break-out.  She's excited.  No harsh benzoyl peroxide (active ingredient is salicylic acid).    The Body Scrub has the little exfoliating "beads" in it (not mentioned on the bottle) - so it makes skin feel smooth immediately.  And the fragrance is very light, clean (gender-neutral).  
Also, it's very concentrated, so it goes a long way - making it easily worth the money as far as any body wash goes (and Amazon's price is better than the in-store price).
Of course, everyone is different when it comes to acne treatments - but it worked here.
