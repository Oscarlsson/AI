This give an excellent finish to a shave.  I strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well.  Apply hot water to dilate your pores, then apply the oil, then shaving cream, shave, and finally the after shave balm.  The oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience.  Your face feels incredibly smooth afterward.  I don't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone, but I do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after
