The Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Creme was a dream for this mother. My 7-year-old was unfortunate enough to inherit a severe callous problem that affects his hands and feet. The problem is so severe in his father that his father's hands and feet are literally split open and very painful. The 7-year-old has already started with very hard calluses and nothing seems to relieve them. Nothing, that is, until now. Just a small nightly dose seems to be helping immensely into giving my dear son back the soft feet I would expect a 7-year-old to have. I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry, cracked feet
