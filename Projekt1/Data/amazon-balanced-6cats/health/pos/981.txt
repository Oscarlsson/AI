You couldn't have picked a better person to Test Drive this product. I have severely dried and callused heals. From the moment I put the creme on my feet, they felt smoother. The creme stays on for hours like the product says. I can't believe the difference it's made in such a short time. I'll definitely buy this product, and I'll be recommending it to my mom, whose feet are drier than mine are
