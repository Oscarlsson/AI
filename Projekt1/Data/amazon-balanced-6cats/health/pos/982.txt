This is the best investment ever! They start you out with everything you need from the liners to the paraffin. It was so easy to set up & start enjoying. I've used it on average twice a week and my feet & hands are so wonderfully moist--even in this winter weather. My heels are no longer cracked & my cuticles are so healthy--not snagging at all. Thank you for this perfect product & so much cheaper than going to the salon! It's so relaxing (I use lavender) as I do this just before bed
