I have been having severe back pain (muscular)and subsequent headaches on a daily basis for many months.  I finally brokedown and went to see one of my colleagues who is a physiatrist.  He recommended the theracane to me.  He is a physician who is both a DC, (Doctor of Chiropractic) and a physician, DO. This physician has been doing trigger point therapy including intramuscular needling to help release the painful knots in my back. I find that I can use the theracane in between visits with noted relief.  This same doctor states that this condition is like diabetes and needs to be managed for life and thus, the theracane allows for me to maintain.  I think the theracane is an ingenious invention.  I don't really have anything negative to say, with the exception of the pain I am trying to manage.  The product arrived quickly after I ordered it and it is exactly as described.
