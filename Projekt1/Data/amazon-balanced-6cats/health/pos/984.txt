The Theracane is a fantastic tool for unknotting hard-to-reach muscles.  It looks clunky, but the shape is right for providing leverage (and therefore more pressure) to just the right spots.

A great companion for the Theracane is "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, 2nd edition" by Clair Davies.  It matches sore places on the human body with the trigger points (the muscle knots) that cause them.  I solved a persistent recurring pain in my upper back by massaging a trigger point near my throat.
