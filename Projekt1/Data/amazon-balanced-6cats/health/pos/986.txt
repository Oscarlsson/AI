We all have from time to time brought those heavy bottle of liquid detergent to the washing machine, and breaking our backs in the process. Thankfully, All Small & Mighty might be a unique solution. It is a concentrated detergent that works with the capacity of a traditional 100 ounce bottle. I like it because it really does a great job at cleaning clothes that haven't been completely spotless from all those tough messes from other methods. I really think that everyone should own this product because it saves a lot of headaches, while being true to its price. That's All!
