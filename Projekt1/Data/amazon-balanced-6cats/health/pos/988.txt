Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break.

Cons: Both sets I purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face. 
The glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the glasses would trap your hair against your face
