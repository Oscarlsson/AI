My wife had high BP, so we got this model.  The reasons for choosing this model were that: 
1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate
2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models
3. Omron seems to be one of the better/best brands.  
4. Supposedly, the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking.

The unit appears well built (including the hand pump).  It is easy to operate, and it seems very accurate.  We checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home, and the automatic unit at the drug store.  We find it takes very accurate and consistent readings.

People with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient.  Also, people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff.  I'm overweight right now, so the cuff barely fits my arm, but fits my wife's nicely (it was bought for her)
