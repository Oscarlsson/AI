After 3 months use, I'm buying two more of these for my daughters. The unit is compact, very sturdy, virtually silent, and puts out plenty of mist even on the low setting. The small tank is light and easy to fill, even in a bathroom sink (many people really have to wrestle with those one gallon tanks) yet it easilly lasts through an 8 hour work day or nights sleep. 

The key feature is that it is small and quiet. That means it can be near you on a desk top or night table. Having the mist nearer to you and less in the ambient air means less will condense on cold windows (and cause mildew). It also means you can use the low setting which makes the small tank last longer and reduces any risk of vapor droplets settling to the table top. If you want to use the high setting, put the unit on top of a book shelf, dresser or file cabnit to allow a longer path for the mist to settle. 

This is small and light enough to take on the road to dry hotel rooms. One daughter wants one for her dorm room, which is overheated. The unit is easily moved from bedroom to den or wherever you locate during the day. You would not find this convenient with large (gallon) humidifiers. 

This unit is also inexpensive, at around $30 which is half the cost of many larger models (so you can get two). After using several evaporative humidifiers, I love not spending $6 - $9 a month for paper replacement wicks. 

Overall, I am delighted with the unit. The only criticsm is the blue LED is too bright in a dark room. This is easily dimmed by putting a piece of masking or adhesive tape over it. The light is helpful to avoid bumping the unit if you reach for the phone or a tissue in the dark of night. It also lights up the mist so you know there is still water in the chamber. 

Highly recommended.
