Hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushHead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards. I use the soft brushHead because I used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen, but since using the Hydrabrush and the 8 brushes (4 on each side) I don't have to worry about missing when I brush my teeth. Excellent product.
