For anyone on the fence about these, jump over to my side ;) My (then) 2 year old had gotten a hold of my husband's permanent black marker. 
We just bought a brand new refrigerator. I turned my back for a few moments, and when I looked back, she had scribbled *all over* my new fridge. 
I tried bleach, soap, scrubby sponges... nothing worked. My first new appliance was ruined!
On a whim I bought this. (Couldn't hurt, right?)
It got it off immediately! (I had to press a little bit to get it out of the grooves.) I was so excited, I started running around my house trying to find things to scrub...
I know that it removes shoe scuffs with ease, markers or crayons from walls, and a multitude of other "sins" your children may commit against your home.
