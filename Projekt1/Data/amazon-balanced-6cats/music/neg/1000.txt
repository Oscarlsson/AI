Not his best stuff. He's running short of lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles "I have a bad feeling about this".

Beats are usually cool, I don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. I didn't mind it so much when he sang REALLY BAD back on his first album, but now it's no longer funny, it sounds like pop.

Anyhow, organized religion is crap. I thought KRS understood this back in the day. What happened? Now he's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy, and his only little diciples and crap, I dunno, it's posative, but then again it's gay like some of his modern tracks.

Anyhow it is cheap, if you have to finish off your collection as I do, then buy it, otherwise go buy his anything BoomBap on back. Or check out:

Kool Keith

El-P

Gang Starr

Mr. Lif

Jedi Miind Tricks

Public Enemy

Non Phixion

Sir Menelik

Most of which is better than KRS' latest works
