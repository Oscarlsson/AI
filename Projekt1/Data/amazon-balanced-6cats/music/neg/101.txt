After carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on Amazon and reading all reviews I had hoped I had made a good choice with this CD.  Unfortunately I discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my Bose Tri-Port headphones.  As a recording engineer I recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground.  The bottom line is I hear this rumble each and everytime I start to relax and it renders the CD completely useless to me.  The recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic.  Since nobody else has complained of this rumble, I will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear
