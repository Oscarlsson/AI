Out of all of the early '90s, L.A. gangster flicks, this one probably had the best set of Chicano oldie tracks.  The movie was laced with them, yet none are on the soundtrack.  Kind of a waste.

Sure, you can get those oldies anywhere.  But it would be nice to have those songs from this movie on one cd.  Again, it was a good sequence they used.  

Aside from that;  It's okay, I guess, if you're a fan of b-list L.A. Chicano rappers.  But, even if you are, you can get better music from their respective albums.  LSOB's first CD from '91 was tight.  If you have that, then you're really not missing anything by letting the  'Loca' soundtrack pass.
