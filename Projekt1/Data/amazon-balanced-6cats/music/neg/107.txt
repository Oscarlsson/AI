This was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G. didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album. This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the L.B.C.".
