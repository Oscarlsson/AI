 Any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" (a 1934 hit song) deserves to be ridiculed, not rewarded with a Grammy. 

I'm just full of original ideas. I can't decide whether to write a song called "Wake Me Up Before you Go-Go" or "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer" - or maybe "Do You Know The Way to San Jose"?
