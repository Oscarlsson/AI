I woke up this morning to the grating sounds of "Good Little Girls" blaring over my clock radio's single, worn-out speaker.  A speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year, such as "There Goes My Life" and "Live Like You Were Dying".  "Good Little Girls" is easily the worst country song I've ever heard - and I thought Neal McCoy was bad!  Blue Country is the C&W equivalent of Wham!  (a dated reference to be sure)
Maybe I'm just getting too old for country music
