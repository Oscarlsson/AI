I agree with all the other reviewers .. nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades ..great playing  from all concerned(except the  cursed Drummer) , I cannot imagine what poor Jerry Gemmot went through with THAT DRUMMER .. he should have been  dismissed immediately ..or shot ..it would have sounded better without him .. Gawd' awful .. spoils the whole dang thing .. any way .. I cannot listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable , so it's back to Soul Of A Man , Re-Kooperation ,  Live Adventures , Super Session , and Kooper Sessions with Shuggie
