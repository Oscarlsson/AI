Anyone ever see any of these rap "artists" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative "entertainers" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying "YEAH!" "UH-HUH!" "WHAT!" "THAT'S RIGHT!" "UH!" etc. Get real.

Meanwhile, the only "music" provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage. It makes for the most dull, predictable "concert" you'll ever see. 

I can't wait until all this nonsense just disappears. In a world of common sense, these idiots would still be flipping burgers at McDonald's.
