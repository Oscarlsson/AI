and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock. Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.

Foo Fighters HAVE made some really good songs, like "Everlong." But I honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if Grohl hadn't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time, NIRVANA. Elsewhere, their fantastic cover versions such as Gary Numan's "Down in the Park" and Prince's "Darling Nikki" suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department
