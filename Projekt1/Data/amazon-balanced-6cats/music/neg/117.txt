With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience
