I thought something must be wrong with my stereo when I first played this cd.  Brooks and Dunn have created some great work, but this is far from it.  Many of the songs are so dischordant, I would  swear that the studio engineer had gone tone deaf or something.  About two decent songs, the rest are not worth having around.  Try some earlier stuff for a better taste of their talent
