Metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever. Most of their trite albums deserve no stars. Their only good cds are either Master of Puppets, or Black Album. KILL EM ALL is such a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! James Hetfield, the lead singer just screams and can't sing at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why???? Why can't he sing more proper like Lou Greamm(Foreigner), & Mark Knopfler(Dire Straits)????????
Each and every song on this album is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't listen to the people who rate Metallica's albums a five star. They are overrated....Green Day is better. Get Them, Dire Straits, and Foreigner insted.

Ps. This album is worth a minus trillion.
