Back 2 Da Basics *1/2 Stars

Yo Gotti has made some decent albums, but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick, gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map, has some good songs here and there, but the rest are just ridiculous, obnioxus and real pretentious.

This is not a good album

Thumbs Down
