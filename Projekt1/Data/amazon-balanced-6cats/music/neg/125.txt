Simon &amp; Garfunle wrote a lot of forgettible music(most notably for the film The Graduate, which would have been a better film without thier dated msuic).  This cd dates very badly as all thier music does, it's got a very limited appeal, only for diehard fans, but beware thsi music really sounds DATED, I mean it's really unlistenable
