This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you "this is a good comeback album" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow
