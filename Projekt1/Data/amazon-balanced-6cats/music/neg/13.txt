After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song &quot;My Only&quot; from the &quot;Good as it gets&quot;  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song
