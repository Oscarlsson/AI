There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother
