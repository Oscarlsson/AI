I can't beleive this guy's arrogance to try and re-record songs that are essentially and always will be Sinatra's domain. Any idiot will tell you that once Sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him. Fact. Ask Tony Bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you. Sinatra IS the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better. Not only does he murder 'a very good year' but also attempts (badly) 'mr. bojangles' even attempting to ape Sammy Davis's mannerisms. I had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a)a joke or b) a blantant attempt by Williams to crossover to boarder appeal. Now i see it actually meant it. Robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please don't attempt the Rodgers and Hart songbook (though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs) your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover can't cover up your mediocrity. The only time i'd like to see you swing is from a lamppost. Stick with 'songs for swinging lovers''come fly with me' to hear the real thing. An insult to classic songs
