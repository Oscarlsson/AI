I love south music like three 6, lil jon, master p, but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead. Man JD is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he can't get no one wit talent. every song on here sounds like it was hurried up. Fu*k so so de and fu*k dem franchize boyz they make me sick.
