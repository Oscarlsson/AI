I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist. 

My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that "very best of" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee. 

Some reviewers are saying there's "heart and soul" all over this album? 
That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too. 

As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very "modern" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.

Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new "very best of" collection)
