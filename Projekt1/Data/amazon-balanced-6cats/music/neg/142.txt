You know, after REALLY trying to like this album, I must agree with K Johnson. Oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible (or just plain plain) upon one or three spins, so when this album didn't move me the first time, I decided to hang back and try again in a few days. Then again. And again. And one more time. Usually after three or four COMPLETE spins (which was like work, with this one)the jems will work there way to the surface. Sufjian Stevens was like that. So was Z by My Morning Jacket. But the problem was that I really wanted to like this one. All the reviews I read were hyping this as the album of the decade, and I wanted them to be right.
Unfortunately, none of them were right. It is a plodding, lifeless album wanting desperately to be 'hip' and failing miserably, to the point of being embarassing almost. Like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail (who will LOVE this, by the way), it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album. I have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this, and they do have talent; it just doesn't get me there. I hope they can live up to the hype next time. I truly do..
