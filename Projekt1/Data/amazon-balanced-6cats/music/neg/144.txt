Can we say, "money making ploy?"  WoW.  I, like many others, have grown up with Disney.  Perhaps I simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs?  This is not like "Kidz Bop" or anything related to that which "kidifies" music - these are timeless movie classics that did NOT need to be redone - and as a further insult, they are poorly redone.  I am very, very let down by these "Disneymania" albums. :o(
