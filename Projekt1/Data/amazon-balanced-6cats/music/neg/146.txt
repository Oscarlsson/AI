Im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately (think tony gayo). There are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore. All prodigy does is spit run-on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he's just there to be there. Amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them. Did we really have to hear this one to see that? If you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving
