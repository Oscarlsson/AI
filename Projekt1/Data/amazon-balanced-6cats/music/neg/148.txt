As for many of these kind of unknown groups, the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of "ambient". But ambient music is music. THis is crap.
Well differently from TWO A.D. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold, because people isn't stupid.
TWO A.D. is light years away from this crap.
Don't waste your money. Listen the the samples by yourself to grab what I mean.
