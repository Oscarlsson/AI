Sarah Brightman is one of my all time favorite artists.  But this disc is just a complete waste.  It is missing so much, and has too many songs that don't belong.  Like the phantom songs.  As much as I love them, save them for the Andrew Llyod Webber collections.  Can't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from "Dive"?  Her "Classics" album had it right.  Except their version of "Captain Nemo" was the rip off live version.  And THIS cd doesn't even have the Captain Nemo song, which is a HUGE fan favorite, and definitly was a single.  It is also missing How Can Heaven Love Me, Eden, Harem, and Beautiful.  All singles as well.  Save your money.  Either buy the "Classics" album for a somewhat better compilation, or just make your own mix like I did.  Because Sarah has so many wonderful songs (And quite a few bad ones I will admit)  And it seems on here they give you some bad ones (like requium and nella fantasia), and leave out the good ones.  "It's A Beautiful Day" and "What You Never Know" are good, but are the weakest songs form Harem.  Why on earth would you leave out "Harem" and "Beautiful", but leave on Beautiful Day and WYNK?  Whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in.  I bet Sarah didn't have much say in this compilation.  This is just a waste.  Beautiful album cover though
