I've never been a fan of Metallica. I like Ride The Lightening, Master of Puppets, and that's it. That's the extent of my enjoyment with their abilities.

However, if there is one quality I've always admired in Metallica, it is their lyrics. They've always had excellent lyrics in their songs, and that was what got me to keep buying albums.

However, I can't credit them for any lyrics on this one. Unfortunately, we're dealing with a bunch of covers.

Some of the songs are pretty good. The only one I can say I really like is Turn The Page, though Seger's original version is leaps and bounds ahead of it. It's got decent music, and the vocals aren't bad. Metallica just couldn't figure out how to honor a classic, and they occasionally sounded like James was trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang, leading his voice to sound overly forced.

Other songs, like Killing Time, were not spared on this album. Unlike with Turn The Page, Metallica didn't even do a halfway decent job covering this. They destroyed a pretty good song. And to be honest, Metallica's guitarist just can't compete with Sweet Savage's (Vivian Campbell??).

Tuesday's Gone was also destroyed. It was too slow and acoustic, but not in the good way it was in the Skynyrd original. In this case, James' voice was terrible. It sounded like he was bleeding the entire time and trying to ignore it. That is, at least, the effect I get from it.

Overall, if you're a die hard fan, you won't like this. It just doesn't have what Metallica did have for songs back with Ride The Lightening and Master of Puppets. If you're just looking for some Metallica, you might as well get this. As long as you are just a small fan, and not a huge one.

Otherwise, this may come as a dissapointment
