especially when there's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful. the songs are so cheesy, her voice is out of place in half the songs. it's whiny, irritating, dull and at this point, I'm not sure who's more talented, her or her sister. they got the looks, sure, but there's lots of pretty girls in this world, doesn't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd. & that's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album. & I'm sorry Jes, but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say
