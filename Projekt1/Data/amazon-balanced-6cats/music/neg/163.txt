as much as I have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled "chemistry"between buckshot and 9th Wonder.  The beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone.  they are working on a part two so I hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was.
