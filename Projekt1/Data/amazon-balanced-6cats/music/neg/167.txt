NO STRINGS ATTACHED IS TO MY MEMORY ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS EVER MADE.NO ONE LISTENS TO THE STUPID BOY BANDS ANYMORE.THIS PIECE OF C@#P DOES NOT SELL EVEN A THOUSAND COPIES TODAY UNLESS THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER IS BUYING UP ALL THE MILLION COPIES HIMSELF.DONT BUY ANY ALBUM FROM N STYNC OR THE EQUALLY HORRIBLE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE.GET ANY BEATLES ALBUM INSTEAD
