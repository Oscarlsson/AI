  Charlotte Church had the most beautiful and captivating voice I ever heard when she debuted.  I purchased all of her albums and played them to death. This CD is horrible!  Her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it.  Some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up.  Ridiculous!  She could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew.  This is simply a tragic waste of talent
