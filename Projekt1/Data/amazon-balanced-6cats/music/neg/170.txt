I absolutely love Charlotte Church's voice, but I couldn't stand even 1 song on this CD.  She's lowered herself to a "Brittany Spears-wanna-be." 

Monotone songs, horrible bass, every song sounds the same.  I am extremely disappointed in this collection of music.  

Buy this one and you're just wasting your money.

Would the REAL Charlotte Church please come back????
