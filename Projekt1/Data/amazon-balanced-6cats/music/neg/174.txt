How can ANYONE say this chick has talent?!!! My God, she is sooooooooo bad. And yes, I actually listened to it. The only reason it sounds semi ok is because she's got millions backing her and that much technology could even make me sound good! She doesn't write any of her songs and she can't hold a tune. Gives Celine a run for her money? Please!!!! The only singer she sounds better than is Paris Hilton! But whatever. If you like it, that's all that matters. If you like pretty young pop stars, Christina Aguilera is MUCH better. She can actually SING!!
