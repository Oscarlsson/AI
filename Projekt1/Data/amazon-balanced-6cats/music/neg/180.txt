I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clichï¿½d classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only.

An indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the Pitchfork Media website...I can't post the link due to strict review guidelines.
