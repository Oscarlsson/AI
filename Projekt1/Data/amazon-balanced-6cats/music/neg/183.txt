First of all, I am a fan of Madonna's music (not all of it, but a lot of it) as well as a huge ABBA fan.  
Now I realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists... and apparently it is here as well, but why can't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic?  
Gimme Gimme Gimme (the ABBA song that is sampled here) is a fairly simple song to begin with (as many ABBA songs are) but the complicated arrangements (both vocally and instrumentally) are what made ABBA's songs interesting and fun to listen to.  
But taking a few bars of the original song, repeating it over and over and over, adding a dance beat, various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece.  
I think she would've been better off either following a similar chord progression to Gimme Gimme Gimme or just doing a cover... 
Perhaps Benny and Bjrn should've stuck to their strict "no sampling" rule here!  
For some reason many of today's dance/pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance... A good example of a radio-friendly dance/pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is Acoustic Alchemy's "So Kylie" on their American/English album (the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what's going on, you'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression).  
Now I'm not going to say "Hung Up" is a terrible song, because everyone has their own taste.  But I'm sorry to say it just doesn't do anything for me..
