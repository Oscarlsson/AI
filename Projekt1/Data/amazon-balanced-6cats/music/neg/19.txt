I'm an avid tony yayo fan, but this album just didn't cut it. maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure. i don't know. but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them. Hopefully his next album will be way better. a few songs are good to listen to. I would think, coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about, but "so seductive" being your first single?? come on. i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean.
