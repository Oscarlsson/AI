Ya, Abomination to God also set it right in his worthy review. I remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that "One Call Away" and "Right THURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" garbage. Does 2 stars explain anything? This apparently is equal to that D4L s***, which is actually the lowest of the low. Anyways, didn't I tell you Chingy would die one year after -Jackpot- hit? 

Now that he's dead, everybodies focused on T-Pain, OH S***!
