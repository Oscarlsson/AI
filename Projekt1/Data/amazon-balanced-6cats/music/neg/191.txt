Lonestar didn't really surprise me with their 2001 effort.  I'm Already There and Not A Day Goes By suffers from "Amazed" syndrome.  Amazed's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album, their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad.  Did they listen to Monster Ballads 2 too much while making this album in Nashville? I'm Already There comes off as very Diane Warren-ish in its sappy lyrics.  Their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay, but these songs don't work for them.  These songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this.
