Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious. 

Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD ("Encore", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well). 

D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here
