I'm surprised this show got past Season 1. Honestly, more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. This show does NOT discover talent, they produce and market it. It is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. The judges are a joke, I guess the producers tell them what to say. Simon "the jerk" Cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone, hey...he has made a living out of it. Randy Jackson's vocab is limited to "yo", "yeah" and "dawg". Paula, who's the only one who I think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone, be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). All in all, a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty, can no-talents like William Hung be hailed as a celebrity. I am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. On a more positive note, it's good that people don't actually buy the albums, thus resulting in total disappearing acts from Idol winners like Ruben and Fantasia...now we just need the American public to stop tuning in to the shows. Well, hope is all we have, right
