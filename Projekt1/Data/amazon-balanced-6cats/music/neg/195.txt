It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.

The problem, of course, is his voice.  The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless.  For starters, he has almost no range at all.  Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices.  By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective.  Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes.

Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project.  Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth.  Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded.  But that's the problem.  On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity.  Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted.  Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits.  To be avoided at all cost.
