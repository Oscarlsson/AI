Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production. This is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. The vocals are waaaaay weak. What exactly is a "re-worked" debut album??? I thought once an album was out it was done, set in stone? Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
