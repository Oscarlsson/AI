someone get this band a producer and put them in a decent studio, please.  the recording and mixing on this disc is flat-out atrocious.   download a few tracks and hear for yourself.

'feburary' and '99 with an anchor' show promise.

otherwise it's taking back sunday meets hawthorn heights meets fallout boy meets .... you get the picture
