I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following.
NWA - Straight Outta Compton
Ice Cube - Amerikka's Most Wanted
Dr Dre - The Chronic
Snoop Doggy Dogg - Doggystyle
Nas - Illmatic
Tha Dogg Pound - Dogg Food
Tupac - Me Against The World
Tupac - All Eyez On me
Tupac - Greatest Hits
50 Cent - Power Of The Dollar
Biggie - Life After Death
You get the picture
