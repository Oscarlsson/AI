I love love tegan and sara and when I found out this was one of their favorite cds I have to admit....I think i was devastated. I just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse.Not just not enjoyable...unbelieveably horrible. I think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music. Don't make your ears go through this much pain
