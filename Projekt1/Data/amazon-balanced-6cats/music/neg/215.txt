Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.

Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name".  But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career
