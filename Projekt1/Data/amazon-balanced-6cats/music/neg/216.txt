Unfortunately, I forked out $14 for this CD.  Upon first listen I am extremely dissapointed.  Being a huge fan of SP for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of Green's previous work.  Also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist.  Use this as Sunday background music on a rainy day; but do not expect to get the party started with this album...
