Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede). 

If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't.
And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.
