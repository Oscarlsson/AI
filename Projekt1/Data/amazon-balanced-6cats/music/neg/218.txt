I love his voice, but the arrangements are way too complex and stilted.  There are about 12 key changes in every song.  The melodies are buried so far beneath his reinterpretations that one can barely recognize the songs. I feel these affectations detract from the songs.  While his vocal gymnastics are very impressive, the result just isn't enjoyable to listen to (unless you are a voice student or professional singer)
