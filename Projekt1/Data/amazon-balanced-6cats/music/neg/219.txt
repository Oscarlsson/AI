that this great music sounds so awful on this CD.

I wanted an introduction to Kate Bush's music, and this CD seemed a very good way to start.  When I put it on, I couldn't believe how muffled and dull it sounded.  I could swear I'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton.

I went to the existing reviews here on Amazon, and, sure enough, Ferrara Brain Pan's spot-on review stated exactly what I was feeling upon listening to these recordings.

It is inexcusable that an artist of Bush's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame, considering how good the songs are.

Another little beef is that the CD clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words, there's room for 30 more minutes of music, which I'm certain could have been well-used, considering the vastness of her catalogue.

I will be looking for the remastered individual albums, but if I didn't know how good Kate Bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection, I wouldn't bother buying any more of her material.

Shame on EMI for allowing this.  I give it two stars (instead of one) simply because the music is so very good
