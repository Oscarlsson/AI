I liked the Santana - Steven Tyler song/video. Since I found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something I buy within reasonable means - I wont buy the CD.

Want to make sure that Sony loses money in this effort - will teach them a lesson. I have been burned by Sony's proprietary [...] before on other items, so I will stay away.
