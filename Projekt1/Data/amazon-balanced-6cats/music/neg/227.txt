FLCL is THE WORST anime of all time, and possibly the worst thing to come out of Japan since the Pearl Harbor attacks, and the soundtrack is just as bad, if not worse.  Its nothing more than J-pop mixed with bad Japanese rock.  Bad guitar playing, boring drum beats, and inaudible bass; you've heard one Pillows song, you've heard them all.  Only "otakus" with no life love this s*** (like Matthew G. Salisbury).

If you want good Japanese music, go for King's Evil.

PS, that album cover is possibly the worst ever made
