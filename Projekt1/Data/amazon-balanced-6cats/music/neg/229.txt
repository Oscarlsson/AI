I just want to slap who ever keeps coming out with these.HARD.Okay,there are some song that deserve this.To be ruined by off key 10-year-olds with annoying high squeaky voices.But come ON!They KILLED 'My Immortal'!That is a beautiful song!I'm listning to it as I write this!And also,little 6-year-olds cannot properly appreciate it!And,let's face it,'My Immortal' is not exactly a kiddie song.I mean,do you want your little 4-year-old boy listning to 'Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams,Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me,These wounds won't seem to heal,This pain is just too real,There's just too much that time cannot erase'?

Please,STOP BUYING THIS CRAP!Not only do they ruin the great songs of our generation,but they also put on some really innapropriate songs.I mean,come ON!Go look up the lyrics to 'Toxic'!That is DEFINATLY not a good song for little children.

Of corse,the only reason any child would like this is because their older sibling listens to it.Then someone should sit them down and explain why this is NOT for them.

Die Kidz Bop
