Many albums, including this one, have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks.  The use of many poetry elements in their lyrics can't save the blandness of the music.  "What About Everything" and "Life Less Ordinary" are good songs.  The rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep.
