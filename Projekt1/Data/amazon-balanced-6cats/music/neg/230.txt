I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.  

Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.
