Do you know why this double CD is often in the bargain basement?  SImply because it is an inferior product.  For some very odd reason, the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember.  For all we know, it may have been a copyright problem. I bought this for my Dad about 5 years ago, but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it. The live recordings on this CD are dismal and not related to the awesome "Hot August Night". 

Fortunately for me,  I own the right Neil Diamond CD's which contain the studio versions.  These are still available . The first is called "12 Greatest Hits" (A black and white photo a young Neil), and the second is called "12 Greatest Hits Volume 2" (a colour photo of Neil sitting on a sofa).  Both of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live recording in sight!!!  

Just released is a new compilation called Neil Diamond GOLD, as part of the GOLD series but I do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings. All I know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks
