I admit to being curious about Rihanna's music because like a previous poster from Brooklyn stated " I was not trying to become a Rihanna fan!!".  I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although Rihanna is no vocal powerhouse, the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs.

I really loved her lead single, PON DE REPLAY and since I don't listen to the radio, it never grew old to me because I heard it so infrequently. It's almost an instantly classic dance track with its hypnotic beats & fun lyrics.

The other standout tracks to me are:

HERE I GO AGAIN - like the island beats of the music and again, her vocals are utilized well on the track

WILLING TO WAIT - more of a straight r&b track with great beats that again, work well with her vocals

LET ME - has an interesting "go-go" beat mixed with a middle eastern sound

RUSH - again, a great dance track

It's unfortunate that her vocal skills are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring very pretty music production, ultimately fail as singles because she is such a weak vocalist: THE LAST TIME - Rihanna attempts vocal runs that are way out of her league and NOW I KNOW - although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty, this song would've been a big hit for a stronger singer.

Honestly, I'd recommend this disc to others who are curious about Rihanna's music and to those who like Ashanti - ultimately they are cut from the same cloth as "artists".  They are able to produce enjoyable singles (through the magic of ProTools) but don't do much in the way of live vocal performances
