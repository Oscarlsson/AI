This is nothing like the classic dead you've heard about.  Far from it.  The sound is too polished.  &quot;Alabama Get Away&quot; and &quot;Althea&quot; are okay but the rest is junk.  I think most dead heads would agree that this is not the one to look for if you just want some of the Deads' best music.  Really... The Grateful Dead with a polished sound??  Just doesn't seem to fit.  Save your money for one of their greatest hits compilations,plus American Beauty, Worjing Man's Dead, Europe '72 and &quot;Dead Set&quot;
