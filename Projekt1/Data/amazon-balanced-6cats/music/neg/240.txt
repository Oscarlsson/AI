First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable 

This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing
