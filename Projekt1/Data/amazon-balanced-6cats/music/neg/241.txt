I bought this album because I loved the title song.  It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album be, right?  Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the Nashville music scene.  He's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town.  I'll get down off my soapbox now.  But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense.  What country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things.
