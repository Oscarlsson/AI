I got this CD after seeing what I remembered as a decent video on Fuse TV.  Maybe I was half-asleep, because after listening to this ho-hum entry into the world of emo copycats, I can't even remember or recognize which song it was.  This album is ultimately forgettable-- better off listening to any Jimmy Eat World CD again and again, which is actually an enjoyable experience
