If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.  I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this.  Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me
