many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece.
It is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album. 
Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
