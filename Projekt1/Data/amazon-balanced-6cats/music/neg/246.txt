Kate Bush's second album, "Lionheart", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing "The Kick Inside Part Two", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.

Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record ("In Search of Peter Pan", "In the Warm Room"), a more pop structure ("Wow"), rhythmic shifts ("Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake") an almost shuffle ("Fullhouse") and a gret rock song ("Hammer Horror").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work ("Symphony in Blue") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects ("Kashka from Baghdad").

The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing "Kashka from Baghdad" can be all that bad, and certainly "Symphony in Blue" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut ("The Kick Inside") or the stunning "Never For Ever"
