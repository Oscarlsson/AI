The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical this is. 

Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march.  In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies.

As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably
