I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times.

But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!!
