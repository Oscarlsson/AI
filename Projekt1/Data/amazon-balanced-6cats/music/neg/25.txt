Wow, did someone slip the wrong CD into my jewelbox or what?

If you're a fan of Allison's other work, epect nothing like what you've heard before.  This is mostly a pop album, and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering.  The sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding.  Even Allisons voice has no drive to it.

Steve Earl is no match on the guitar for Joe McMahan who played on the Show CD/DVD.
