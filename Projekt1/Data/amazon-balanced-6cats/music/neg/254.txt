Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.  

Some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful.  That's rubbish.  There is a complete absence of melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a great song).  The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening.  Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints.  But it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure.  Believe, I listened to Devil & Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am apparently missing.  I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice album.  I even liked the Devils & Dust solo tour (Bruce is a powerful performer, and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage), but I doubt this CD will ever find its way back into the player
