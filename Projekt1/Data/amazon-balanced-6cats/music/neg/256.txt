Bob James - the mastermind of smooth Jazz. "H", "Touchdown", "Grand Piano Cannyon". Eternal pieces of Art. Brave and thoughtful new directions in Jazz. We owe him a lot.
But the recent releases of Fourplay -including "X" - don't meet my expectations at all: predictable, repetitive, overproduced Computer-music.
The typical Fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another CD. 
Larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on "Tournabout" - but then the song falls back again to old routine. "Screenplay" is a good one (one of two songs that were done by Bob). The rest, hmm... some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy.
Don't get me wrong, I like all of the guys. Every single member of the group has done great things in the past. 
So - a bit more breveness,  Yes Please
