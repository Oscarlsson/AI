This album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today, this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2. Right before female rappers(there's a few exceptions), I hate all little kid rappers. Even when I was a kid. I don't like anything on this album, I still got the tape and it hasn't "krossed" my mind to even cop the cd. If you like this kind of stuff, or you loved "jump" back in the day then I guess this is for you
