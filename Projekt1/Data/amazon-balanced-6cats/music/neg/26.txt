I really really really really like Allison Moorer.  Have been a fan since her first record, have road-tripped to see her numerous times, and love her songwriting and singing.

That said -- "Getting Somewhere" is by far the least satisfying of her records.  No memorable songs.  Over-produced.  No "guts", as another reviewer said.

When the Allison Moorer/Doyle "Butch" Primm songwriting team called it quits (in more ways than one), their Lennon/McCartney-caliber teamwork was lost.  Not that Moorer sounds like The Beatles, but Allison and Butch complemented each other well when composing music.  

This CD is not only unmemorable but I doubt I would care to ever listen to it again.  Such a shame.  I've never had anything negative to say about Allison in the 8 years I've been a fan.  But this CD left me cold.

It hurts a bit to say this, but I cannot recommend this CD.


The closest analogy I can think of that relates to how different this CD is from her earlier work is the B-story line from an episode of "The Larry Sanders Show".  In that episode, Sanders' head writer Phil (played by Wallace Langham) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy.  As a result he lost his edge.  When he was a miserable person he was an edgy, cynical, funny jokewriter.  When he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job.      Same with Moorer.  Since her recent changes in her social life she has started "singing a sweeter tune" in her life, but it came with a cost.  She doesn't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that "other" songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy, sad, sometimes bitter, or at least that's how I interpreted it.  Granted, that wasn't her entire oeuvre, but it is what made her songs special for me.  Now she's happy and she might as well be writing songs for Barney the Dinosaur
