Another torrent of mild tripe from everyone's "favourite" DJ, Tiesto.  
What on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane, pastel-coloured eurovomit dance music runs out?
When I think about the number of times I've heard him touted as "World's Number One Best Voted DJ" or "DJ Mag Top 100 Finalist", you'd start to think that the man can actually mix records, when in fact rather than mix them, he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new, unusual and horrendously nauseating forms.  I can absolutely confirm this. I have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live.  
The sad truth of the matter is, that there are any number of drug-addicted fluoro-pants-wearing 16 year old ravers out there, and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this.  Or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas.
I sign off in disgust
