Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good.

Traffic
UR
Adagio For Strings
Nyana

Those songs are just great and the best off the album.
But songs like

Walking On Clouds
Sweet Misery
Love Comes Again
Forever Today

can only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though.  No song here is annoying in the beginning and I see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for Dj Tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it.  Cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff.

Dj Tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 Dj I expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoying

Verdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 Not bad for the first 20 listens but damn I could have enjoyed it much more
