Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, &quot;Reptile,&quot; makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with &quot;Backless,&quot; &quot;Another Ticket,&quot; and &quot;Money &amp; Cigarrettes&quot; all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans
