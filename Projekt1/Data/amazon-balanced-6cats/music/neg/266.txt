This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves.
