Shannon Lawson is capable of a much better album.  I saw him down in Nashville when he was with the Galoots, and it was amazing!  If they were to put out a CD I'm sure it would be one of my favorites.  Shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what Nashville should have let him do on his first solo CD.  Instead they gave it this generic, overproduced sound, leaving Shannon sound like everyone else.  With the way bluegrass is selling these days, it's a shame that Shannon couldn't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena..
