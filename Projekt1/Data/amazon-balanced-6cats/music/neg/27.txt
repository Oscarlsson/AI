Now on their sixth studio album (and second on a major label) Carbon Leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock/pop of "Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat." Lead vocalist Barry Privett has a warm, pleasant way of delivering his lyrics, and renowned producer Peter Collins fulfills his duties. Nevertheless, the 11-song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety. In fact, it is so subtle that not one song is memorable.

Some lyrics are heartfelt ("The War Was In Color" recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson, lead single "Learn to Fly" regretfully summons up inner strength) but with such flat, by-the-numbers melodies these songs have little to stand on. Everything sounds just fine, but nothing is endearing. Every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance, and Privett, despite his appealing voice, could easily be singing one extremely long song. 

This project is obviously well-intentioned, but many other bands have done this before and better. These guys without a doubt have talent, but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason. Next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than the one on this record.
