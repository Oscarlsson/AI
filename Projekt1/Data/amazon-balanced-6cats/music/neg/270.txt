[First of all: I only gave this one star because the rating doesn't let you go any lower] I only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it, leaving me to pick it up. I proceeded to suffer through it so I could give you fair warning. If you buy this, consider yourself warned
