There is now no trace of delight left in this band. All songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self-indulgent. I do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever I receive a doe-eyed look saying their name, but this CD and the CD previous (which did have 1 tune, "Apples," with which one could smile) does, for the first time, take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes.

First, we loose the Roses, then the Ned's disband, following that, Swervedriver breaks apart and Velocity Girl is gone forevermore. Now my Charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were.
