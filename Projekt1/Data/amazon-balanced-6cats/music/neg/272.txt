Okay, I used to think that Nelly was a fun guy to listen to. He made songs that I used to enjoy, such as St. Louis, E.I., Country Grammar, and Ride Wit Me off of the CD "Country Grammar". Then there were a good amount of other good songs on "Nellyville". And the good thing about these CDs was that there were not too many skip tracks. But with Nellyville, Nelly brought us the obnoxious Hot In Herre, a single that got plenty of radio playtime, but I could not stand. This was not a good sign for the future. Then comes these two new CDs, Sweat and Suit. I have not listened to most of Suit, but I have listened to most of this, and it is pure garbage. This is the same Nelly who made Hot In Herre for sure. It has a bunch of catchy songs that live off the beats and the hook to drive them to get radio playtime. Most of the tracks are much worse than Hot In Herre, if that is believable. I just want a decent CD from Nelly, I am not expecting a classic. Instead he drops the definition of materialistic garbage, and I shake my head in disgust. Avoid this one and get one of his older CDs, or a CD from a better artist
