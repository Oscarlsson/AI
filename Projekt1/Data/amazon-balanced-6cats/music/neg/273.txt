I find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented D.J. to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar; Ripping off the kids droned and purged on the MTV feedbag, and this man Paul Wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them.

Notice his rhymes don't descend any futher than his mouth, his car and his money. What excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me? Does it reach artistic heights? 
Or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame?


And still people eat it up like Chicken N Dumplin's on a cold winter's day

This is excactly whats very wrong with today's hip hop, it's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely

Stay away from this awful garbage

don't let MTV rob another cen
