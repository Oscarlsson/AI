This album is pure crap! Just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from Straight Outta Cashville, until he can make a real new album, not this microwaved crapola. If you like Buck, get Straight Outta Cashville, an Beg For Mercy, than wait for his future release, with actual new tracks. I strongly advise you not to buy this. It is a total rip off. I wasted my time Downloading this
