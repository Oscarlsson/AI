I can't believe the other people giving this high marks. I love the wheel, but darn if this isn't just terrible. There isn't even a single on it; I can't believe the studio released it. Thank god I got a promotional copy and didn't have to go buy it in the store. The Catherine Wheel needs to get back together--quick
