God, I can't believe this guy. Ja Rule was never a gangsta in his life, he can't talk gangsta. And stop trying to be like Tupac, Tupac actually was a gangsta. Your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you'd wet your pants. This guy should be booted out of the game, not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s*** as if he went through it, his ruining hip hop. Yeah and Ja, stop dissing Eminem and 50. You know perfectly well that they'd kill you in a battle anyday. Ja Rule has always been s***. Go listen to real rap
