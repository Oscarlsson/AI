Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS. LEAVE GNR ALONE....GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS.
