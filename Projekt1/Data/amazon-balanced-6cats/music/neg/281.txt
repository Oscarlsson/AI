I am a 23 yr old mother of a 2 1/2 yr old. Not only are these children HORRIBLE singers, but there is a reason that most parents don't let their children listen to the original songs... they teach them things they don't need to know.   I thought this would be a "kids" version that would get rid of that stuff when I let a child I was babysitting put the cd on... and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children.  They didn't take that out!  Children are exposed to that every day in our world now, telling them it is "normal" and "ok".  Parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today.  It becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for "kids" that teaches them that those things are "normal".  They assume if it is ok for a kids cd, it can't be that bad.  I think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child!  Some of the songs I like in the originial version and do listen to, and this CD has ruined them!  But when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and doesn't mean what they say is ok... I think it is the WORST thing you could buy for your child
