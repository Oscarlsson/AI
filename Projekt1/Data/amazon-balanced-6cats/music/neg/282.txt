I understand why the Beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck. They only made about two decent songs in their "Hey Jude" a pretty song, and "Ballad Of John And Yoko". The sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's "Down By The River".
I have listened to the Beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time. This ONE album is definately not the album to buy at ALL unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music.
Here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want good music, I recommend go buy albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, and Metallica insted. Don't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs
