If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately
