He was at his best when he sang about the loneliness, perseverance and dreams of ordinary people.  In "Sandra" for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour.  The combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique.  In the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions.  He released a few inspired tracks now and then, his first Christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth, and "Here at the Mayflower" was a sincere effort. He is an intelligent person who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his head.  

So, what has changed?  And why this late in his career?  Barry has reinvented himself as a Las Vegas entertainer, Liberace style.  And he's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens.  I have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy, like Liberace did.  And I have deep respect for that.  But I personally regret that Clive Davis and Manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that doesn't really have any demands.
