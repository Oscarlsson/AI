my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs. for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews.
i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral, on and on, everything....
except deep.
deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having.
painfully uninspired and recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely.
my advice: take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born killers), dead souls (joy division cover originally for the crow), and the perfect drug (originally for lost highway) all have in time (the former two on halo 8 DE and the latter on halos 11, 12, and 15 in extended form)
