It's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer. Yeah, maybe my fish can get a record deal: They "sing" in tone, can breath, but refue to lip-synch(I know it sounds gay). This is just sad because bands that PLAY THEIR OWN INSTRUMENTS, WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS, and PERFORM THEIR OWN SONGS can pretty much get almost no attention. Let's take the band King's X: Doug Pinnick (vocals/bass) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about God (King's X is a Christian band); Ty Tabor (guitar/vocals) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably don't know; and Jerry Gaskill (drums/vocals) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people (I know a lot more people than that like KX; I'm just exagerating) seem to like this band. It's sad. If you want good music, listen to the band I just menioned (King's X if you weren't paying attention).
