I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.

For every song worth listening to ("Suck My Kiss", "Give It Away"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded.  This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.

On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief.  Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny.  They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.  People were walking out in droves
