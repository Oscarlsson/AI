Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows!  I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting.  NO!!  A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.   Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.  

When I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E., so I decided to give them a second chance.  The sound guy must not have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder.  "Louder" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in their music.  "Yeah, SUCK louder!" Someone else yelled - I had to agree & give him a high-five.  Maybe I would have liked this when I was 12 and didn't know any better.  ZERO STARS
