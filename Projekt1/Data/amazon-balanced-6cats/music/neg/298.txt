I was disappointed when I received this CD.  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two.
By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes.  Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible.  If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why.
I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all.  As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own.
I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop.  If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere
