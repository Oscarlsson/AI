This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship.
