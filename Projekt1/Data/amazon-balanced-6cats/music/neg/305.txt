A friend of mine turned me on to Spoon, and at first I listened enthusicatically... but then I got bored. Although Spoon's songs may be catchy at times, they are empty and deviod of any alterations. The same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so, but in the end I don't think I've ever listened to an entire track. If this is 5 star music today, our culture is severely lacking depth
