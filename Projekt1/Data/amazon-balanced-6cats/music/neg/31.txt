I think India is one of the most talented artists today. Her voice is sensational. Sadly, as with many great artists today, this album feels more producer/market-driven rather than artist-driven. I understand that Regaetton is popular right now. I would even understand including a few Reggaeton-flavored songs to "keep up with the times" (Shakira's "La Tortura" comes to mind). But who mixes two genres within a single song?!? "Soy Differente" flows perfectly as a salsa, until Regaetton beats come in. The style feels very out-of-place in this song, as in most other songs in this album. Maybe this kind of thing will work at a club, but not for extended listening. In my opinion, the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling India's own style. I hope she will regain contol by the next album
