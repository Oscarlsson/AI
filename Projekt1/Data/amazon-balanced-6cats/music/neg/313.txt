I forgot how bad this album was until I popped it into my CD player the other day.

It seems like every song has one or two parts that are totally killer, followed by 3-4 minutes of boredom.  The song "Epic Problem" is good throughout, and Full Disclosure is EXCELLENT except for the horrible screamed verses.  Strangelight is awesome too, and not very typical of Fugazi.  The Kill is also good in the same way, it's very chilled out.  Past these few standout tracks(which wouldn't be standouts at all on any other album of theirs) there isn't much reason to listen to the album.  It's incredibly boring.

I suggest picking up any other fugazi album first, maybe 13 songs, red medicine or in on the kill taker
