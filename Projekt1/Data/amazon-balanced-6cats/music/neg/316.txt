I just sold this back through Amazon, I was so disapointed with it. It's an all cover record, and while Greg Duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers, all of the music feels too subdued, too flat.

Duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the Whigs and the first Twilight Singers recording.
