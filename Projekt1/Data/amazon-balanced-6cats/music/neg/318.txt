Yo Gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one, I dunno what happpened.....The production seemed too generic, the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all, and doesnt carry much replay value....To be honest, id pop in a Three 6  Mafia cd rather than this one....Album was slacking on so many levels, now theres some tracks that listenable, but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album, nothin special bout it at all...This album waz overhyped I believe and flopped horribly.......Gotti can do much better than this.....Wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out.....
