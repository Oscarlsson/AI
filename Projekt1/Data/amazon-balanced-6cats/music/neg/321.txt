I can understand that Robin felt a need to include some of the biggest Bee Gees hits to appease the fans, but the ones that were sung by Barry are below wretched here.  Robin frequently disappears in the sound mix, becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony.  That's fine for a group concert, like the Bee Gees, but inexcusable for a solo effort.  His stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act.  They should have kept this in the can.  It seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for Robin. Don't do him the favor
