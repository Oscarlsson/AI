A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews.  In one sense I like it.  The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique.  But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD.  This dude has the worst voice in music history.
