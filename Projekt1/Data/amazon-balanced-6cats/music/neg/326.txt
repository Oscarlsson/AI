This has got to be the worst pile of trash I ever heard, right now I cant think of anything worse then this. The same ol trash bling and girls. And if you got JD and Bow wow on your album at the same time, its gonna be wack. And do these n***** even know what franchise mean? What does that word have to do with their name? I'll just start a click called ham & cheese and rap about flip flops and thongs for that matter
