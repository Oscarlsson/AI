I purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend.....a few hours later in ended up in the bin.....very dissapointing, bland and not to mention boring and derivative (some people from New York would understand what I mean).  In summary....not only does kylie mingogue (I wont grace her name with capitals) fall flat on cd....she also cannot perform live and rely's on "gay camp it up" imagery to hide behind (a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit).  A very bad performer and a shameful album.
