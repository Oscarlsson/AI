Wow!  Tom Morello, Flea, Pete Yorn, Chris Cornell, Brad Wilk, Maynard James Keenan.  When I first heard of this superstar line-up, I was sure that this CD was going to be awesome.  I was duped like everyone else who bought this album.  Axis of Justice (or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as "Axis of Jackasses") is really a bad album, even for a bunch of political liberal rockers.  Serj and Tom really dropped the ball with this one. What could've been a festoon of awesomeness turned out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy message.  Knowledge, The Night Watchmen, and Ahmed Ahmed are among the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to listen to.  The song,"Jeffrey, Are You Listenng?" is up there with other crappy songs like John Mayer's "City Love" and Richard Harris' "MaCarthur Park."  On top of all that, the communist entertainer known as Michael Moore adds his little nugget of wisdom on the DVD, which I can say I've become dumber now that I've listened to it.  For the love of all good music, stay far away from this CD
