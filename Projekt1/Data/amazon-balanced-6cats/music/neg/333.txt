all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop, its not what LL, Rakim, KRS-one, Kool G Rap, Ice T, Ice Cube, NWA, and (rip) BIG AND PAC, started.  We as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, THIS FAKE RAP IS GOT TO STO
