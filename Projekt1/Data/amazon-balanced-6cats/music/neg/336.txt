can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music?  ive listened to many bob dylan albums, and every one is a gem.  freewheelin' is my favorite, but so what?  it doesn't matter which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst record was, and its saved.  im not one to question this man's beliefs or anything like that, bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is?  could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith?  almost certainly not.  but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain
