This is an endurance test. As in 'bitches brew''live evil''love at the Fillmore' latter day Miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium. It makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. Take 'yesternow' it takes for ever for Billy Cobham to find a beat. This is just self indulgence of the worse kind, a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers. Miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music. This album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period. McGaughlin's guitar though breathtaking in the Mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs, totally without any structure and fire (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with Miles) Disjointed would be too kind a word. When you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). Miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. Maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant, but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess
