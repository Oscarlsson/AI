This is the album when Ja officially became a b*tch. His first 2 albums was good, I enjoyed them both and those are highly recommended. I hated this s*it from start to finish. This is a waste of space in the cd case. How can you be a murderer and a singer at the same time? Now I don't mind too much about redoing a song about or with a dead rapper, BUT YOU SHOULD'VE AT LEAST KNEW HIM MUTHAF***ER! Another disembowelment to one of Pac's classics. I stopped listenin' to Ja because he made a big change. Not cause of 50. Unlike some turncoat fans.
