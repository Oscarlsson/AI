Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones.
Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs.
