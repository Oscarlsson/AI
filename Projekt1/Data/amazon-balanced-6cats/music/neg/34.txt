Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints.  I am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with James past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical).  While Mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work.

 Like many aging musicians, Mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse.  The cliche and empty "We Cant Make It Here" is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility.  Mcmurtry, previously able to frame an issue, seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills.   Criticism is not intelligence, and we can only hope that Mcmurtry can get on track going forward.  Perhaps he should shun the  "PC Crowd" and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial American Scene for his next album
