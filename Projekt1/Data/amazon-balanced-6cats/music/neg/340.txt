I want this guy to succeed so badly, yet he just couldn't pull it off. 

His voice has a great sound to it, pleasant to the ears, yet his interpretation was just not there. His  phrasing was very lazy and boring most times. It seemed like he didn't know where to start the next word. And he also sounded out of breath. He sounded so out of breath that I started gasping for air...I had to stop listening.  To add to that, John's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger.

I truly hope with age and experience he improves. There's no reason why he should not. He's not in the catagory of a Buble' or Connick Jr. yet.
