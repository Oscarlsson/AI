people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this.
