I never could understand why the Beatles are so popular? They are pretty boring too just like Pink Floyd. Each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds. I just dont like it because it sucks! Dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below. The Beatles only made one good album and that's the one which contains Ballad Of John And Yoko, Hey Jude.
