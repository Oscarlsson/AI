This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice
