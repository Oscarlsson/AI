I found a supposedly "New remastered edition" of Sade's "Diamond Life" on sale for less than 10 bucks. OOPS! Great mistake! When I tried to return it, the CD store was already out of business, and the copy is one issued in the Netherlands which is marked INTO THE BOOKLET as "2000 Digital Remastered Version". The whole album HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED with new arrangements! The digital sound is quite good, but the new arrangements made for 'Smooth Operator' REALLY SUCKS!!
