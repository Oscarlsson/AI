Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."

These guys were just the beneficiaries of Rolling Stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (And to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) I think Martin Newell put it best when he called the Band "dreadful bearded ghastliness."
