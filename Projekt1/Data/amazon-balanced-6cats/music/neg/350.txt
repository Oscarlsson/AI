I got this CD because I loved their radio hits "Bring Me To Life" and "My Immortal." While those songs are beautiful, they are not representative of the rest of the album. Although I tried and tried to get into this CD, the hard rock teen goth style just isn't my cup of tea, and the lyrics are too depressing. If you are a fan of bands such as Linkin Park or Seether, you might enjoy this. However, if you only like "My Immortal" and "Bring Me To Life" because of Amy's powerful vocals, you'd be better off listening to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan.
