This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever heard.  Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????

Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.

I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD.  You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh.  And it continues throughout the entire CD.  There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all.  It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.

Don't believe me?  Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.

Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews.  Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem.  Then make your decision to buy or not buy
