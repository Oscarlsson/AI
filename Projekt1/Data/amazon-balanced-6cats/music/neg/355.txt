Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me after
the good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recorded
Cheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered 
down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many 
Live disks they did.

After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for 
many years, is the only thing here to write home about when 
one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later.

Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I had
recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trick
got better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic Rick
Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brother
Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"...

Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums through
the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's not
hard to get better than this and five months later the solid,
but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the
guys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned 
out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the
band. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80'
