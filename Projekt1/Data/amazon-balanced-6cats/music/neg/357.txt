This is the only album I own of Joe Strummer minus The Clash. I can't say it's very good. I hate having to compare it with it with his work with The Clash but it's inevitable. His lyrics aren't as great, edgy or provocative. There isn't any fantastic music either. I am not really sure what to say since I haven't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad, I truly tried my hardest to like it. But I feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake. Believe me: I absolutely love everything about The Clash, the lyrics, Joe's voice, the music, the attitude and how cool they were, this is not Joe at his best, it's cool though cause now he's gone: go buy some Bob Marley albums instead, Joe would not have minded
