Boney used to be the man, but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should listen to his older stuff like Seduction, Trust, or Backbone. You will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential. Cmon'Boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of. Peace
