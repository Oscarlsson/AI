This album isn't not very good at all.  There are about four songs I like.  First off, the production on this CD is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats.  Then, the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically.  Then, there are no new verses from Biggie, on the album.  They should have stopped with Born Again, because album will be a forgotten one, not a great way to close out the legecy of Bigge Smalls
