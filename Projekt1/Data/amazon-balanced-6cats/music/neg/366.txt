Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living legend. But this album, like the last album "produced" by her son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices. 
PS - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer; blues, R/B, soul, whatever,  in the world.
