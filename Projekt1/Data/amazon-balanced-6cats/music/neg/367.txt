or in their entire career for that matter.  I have tried to like this band, but Greg Dulli just won't shut up.  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on.  The guitarist keeps things mildly interesting, but on this album in particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once.  It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they mash it together and call what they've done songs.  EXCEPT for the one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz beat of all things.  "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo.  Instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do, everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it.  IT's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have heard.  I tried to like them, I really did.  I wanted to find the band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest of dark, passionate, noisy music like that.  Too bad, no wonder they drifted apart
