In the past, I used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. I'd be introduced to band, not like it, and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me'. The Forecast, however, has changed how I feel. I, personally, love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy, but only because I was introduced to Jimmy Eat World and Spitalfield a couple of years back. Those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole, and expand my emo knowledge. Imagine though, if you will, that I was new to emo. You, in theory, hand me a copy of "late night conversations" and tell me to listen. Of course, I hate it, and lose any interest I may have had in the genre. To make a long story short, the only good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an underproduced, generic, stale piece of s**t) was the revelation that came post-listen. Never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). Not every metal band is Iron Maden. Not every punk-pop band is blink 182. Not every nu-metal band is linkin park. Not every 'emo' band is jimmy eat world. Every aspect of music has it's ups and downs, and the forecast is clearly one of the downs.

Now that I've bored you with an entire rant about nothing, I'd like you to PASS on 'late night conversations'. With your help, the forecast won't sell another record, and, in turn, leave the scene forever. Not recommended, duh
