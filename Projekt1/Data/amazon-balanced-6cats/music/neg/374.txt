The people who have mentioned Aphex Twin and Four Tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists. If you liked the Stone Roses you will like this. It's not an 'electronic' album at all. I've ordered Manitoba's earlier cd after listening to the samples (the reason for purchasing both these albums) and I certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'Up in Flames'. It's funny, I promised myself I would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading, either that or Dan Snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years
