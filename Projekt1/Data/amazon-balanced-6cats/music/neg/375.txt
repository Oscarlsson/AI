I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand. 
I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire & Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm wrong
