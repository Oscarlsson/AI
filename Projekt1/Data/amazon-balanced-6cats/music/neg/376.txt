Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.

Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song "I Fought Piranhas".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times.
