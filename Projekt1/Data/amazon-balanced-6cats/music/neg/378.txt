of every band/group, there is always the weak link, Tony Yayo proves that he is the one with Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon.  Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in "greasy" and bad beats.  Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect.  He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well.  He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up.  The few pluses on the album are "Drama Setter" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as "G-S**t".  My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00
