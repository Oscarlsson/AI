it sounds like someone somehow got the deftones to suck worse than they already do. this album isn't nearly as musically interesting as tear from the red. i don't mind the singers new approach to vocals, but it just sounded like they didn't try at all. all the songs sound the same, the tempo is too fast on almost all the songs for the screamo sound, and hearing random voices and sounds of them in the studio between recordings just makes the album drag. although they've goten much tighter as a band and aren't as sloppy as they used to be, (they fell out of sync a lot in the opposite of december) this album was definitely a backwards step in their progression as real musicians. save your money and buy tear from the red instead
