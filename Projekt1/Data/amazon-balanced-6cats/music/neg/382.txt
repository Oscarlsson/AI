I gave 2 star for this CD not because of the musical quality...but because the last song "Goodnight My Love" is cut short on this CD.
After watching the live performance on cable, I rushed out to buy this CD, labeled by Hybrid. Only to find out my favorite song "Goodnight My Love" was cut short. On the CD, it ends with  the sax doing a solo then fades away....which leaves the song dangling and unfinished!!!   On the video, this song ends with Art singing "bring you closer to me" and the music slowly ends beautifully, correctly.
There's a version out which was released by Sony in 2003. I don't know if this version contains the full song.
The Hybrid Label version is simply ridiculous!!!  How can you possibly end such a beautiful song short!! leaving it unfinished....and well....SHORT and listeners wanting more!!!

If someone can verify if the Sony conatins the full "Goodnight My Love"...or tell me where I can get this verson,  would really appreciate it
