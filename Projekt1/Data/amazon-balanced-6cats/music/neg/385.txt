I own this set, as does my roomate, and we both hate it. It highlights bands like 'red lorry, yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to, and  uses great classic bands like Bauhaus' worst song as the first track. It is  the hollow, tin-y, embarrassingly hokey side of goth, and i am ashamed to  even have it in my house
