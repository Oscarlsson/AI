I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!!
