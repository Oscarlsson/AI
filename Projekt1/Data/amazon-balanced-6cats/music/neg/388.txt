Generally on Amazon.com, the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is, the albums are usually highly overrated. This is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve. As a result of this, generally, albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums. Ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album. Average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album. As I mentioned before, due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums, the average score rarely falls below 3 stars. It takes a pretty horrendous album, like Limp Bizkit's Results May Vary, to get a score of even 2.5. In fact, I didn't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is, until I saw this pile of feces.

Now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of "hataz" reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it. Out of all the terrible albums I have viewed, I have never seen this happen before. Not even to bands as terrible as Limp Bizkit or even An*l C*nt. This obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and, hopefully, the end of Chingy's 15 minutes of fame
