 I loved '' careless love`` and saw Madeleine live here in Rio de Janeiro in a reasonably good show.I am quite disappointed with this album however because I had great expectations.Let's face it folks, however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.She needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.This is obvious from seeing her live.
 So what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight  on her  vocal delivery? Those songs need an Ella,a Sarah Vaughn,or even a Shirley Horn -to name some  giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range, timing and phrasing.
 To compound the problem , the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.Everything is much too soft and distant (unlike careless love).If you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last Shirley Horn cds.
 Last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to  very minimalist backing chores.
 I think there is a misconception with the record excecs that M.P. has the qualities to make her a modern  pop-jazz diva ala Diana Krall.She has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.Good luck.
