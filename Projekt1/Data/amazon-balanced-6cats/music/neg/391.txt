I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime
