Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set.
