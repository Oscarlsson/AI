I purchased this album because I am a fan of the Last Poets.  Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats.  However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out of the Ghetto Blues."  If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for.  I would take the Last Poets' album "This Is Madness" over this particular Scott-Heron album
