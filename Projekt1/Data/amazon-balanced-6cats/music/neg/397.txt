I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys.  With Tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released.

Now, while there are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save Mes."  The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it.  It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus.  Considering Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around, drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong.  It doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had.

Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of Jayhawks throw-aways
