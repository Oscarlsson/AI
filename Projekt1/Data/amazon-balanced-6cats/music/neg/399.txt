This album is not very good. I am a big fan of Life in General, At the show, and Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo but this sucks. I listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip. But I didn't care, becuase it sucked. It was boring, and it had no flavor. Not the Mxpx I used to know
