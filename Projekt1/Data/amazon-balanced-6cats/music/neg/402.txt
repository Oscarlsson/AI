I like Jennifer Lopez, but I am not a fan of J.LO...let me explain. Jennifer started her career in the mid 90s, did some promising work (Selena / Out of Sight / The Cell / Blood and Wine / etc.), and a very well done debut album for an actor (On the 6). Everything was genuinely promising. UNFORTUNATELY, once "J.LO" was born (circa 2001), her endeavours got weak, too commercial for the sake of money, too fixed only to hype her up, not all that original nor different than anyone else, to truly stand out. "Rebirth" is an example of that. When I heard Get Right for the first time, I loved it, I thought it was catchy. It harkened the days of On the 6..that sassy, groovy, R-n-B vibe she had. Then I caught Step into my world, the only real R-n-B track on the album and thought, I'm feelin' it, definitely a favorite to this day. The the rest came along (3-11) and I thought, Sony & J.LO made this for the sake of money, due to her films doing poorly, hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album. I thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate. I think she is a great performer, a very talented person, but I honestly don't feel this album makes her an artist, merely a reworking of herself musically.
I rank it 3rd in her album line...

On the 6 (4 stars)
J.LO (3 stars)
Rebirth (2 stars)
This is me...then (2 stars)
