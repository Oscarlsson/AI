Their basically what would happen if you took P.O.D's lyrics, and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about God and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice, so you have a band so bad it makes God himself want to commit suicide. The song titles are also annoyingly bad, obviously made so they sound artistically genius (but instead monotonous). 

And to everyone who thinks these guys are metal, they deserve to be buried alive. Metal is Fear Factory, Lamb of God, In Flames, and Arch Enemy. These guys are about as metal as Maroon 5.
