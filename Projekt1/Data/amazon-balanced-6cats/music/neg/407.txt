JUST LIKE IN MY OTHER REVIEW I CAN'T FIGURE OUT  THE MADNESS OVER THESE GUYS. I WILL ASK IN THIS POST AS WELL FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE HEARD AND ARE RELEVANT IN A CREATIVE WAY. HONESTLY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CALL THESE GUYS ARTISTS. AN ARTIST CREATES SOMETHING FROM A IDEA OR TWO THESE GUYS TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND JUST LUMP THEM TOGETHER. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND TO TOP IT OF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS AS MUSICIANS TO BE RELEVANT IN THAT FORM EITHER. A COMMENT LIKE "THEY ROCK" OR "THE LEAD SINGER IS SOOOO HOT" AREN'T EXAMPLES OF A GREAT ARTIST OR BAND. FROM THE DATES OF THE LAST POST MY WORDS MIGHT BE IN VAIN, KIND OF LIKE THE VALIDITY OF THIS RECORD. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A POST ON HERE FOR TWO YEARS. IF A FAN OF BANKING BENJAMINS DOES STUMBLE UPON THIS POST I INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS, AND CHECKOUT SOME RELEVANT AND GREAT MUSIC
