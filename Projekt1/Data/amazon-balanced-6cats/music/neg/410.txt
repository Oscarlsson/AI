I won't go into a long diatribe. Suffice it to say that when I listened to this upon its release earlier this year, I was disappointed. I gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great. This is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit. There's a point where baez messes up a song. (i don't have anything against baez. that being said, i don't have much FOR her either.) There's joking and laughing, but really, I don't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he'd rather be in the audience than performing. You can almost sense WHY dylan went electric in this concert.

The bootlegs prior to this are superior and I would suggest that if you aren't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them. If you really like dylan's acoustic work and not his electric stuff, you should be pleased with this double-disc.

I love dylan, but not enough to enjoy this over and over again. I'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix
