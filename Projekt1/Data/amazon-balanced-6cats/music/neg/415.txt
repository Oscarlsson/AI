Crikey!!!! What is this chunder? Wait a minute....art students from "Down Under" get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of "The Wiggles", decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base! Yeah, this stuff could be the soundtrack to "Forrest Gump" alright. "Run, Forrest, run! Run as fast as you can from this crap!!!" And these guys are touring, too? Are they touring with Barney & Friends?

There is not one thing of value to this other than that the CD itself makes a handy coaster for your Foster's..
