LOL! Some people cant be serious these days. The lyrics on every track are straight garbage. So he failed BAD lyric wise. Production wise, some of the beats are pretty good, but a beat doesnt make a song good! Nor does it make horrible lyrics good!! So I think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try J-Kwon, but the game aint for you. I think this album is garbage
