This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness
