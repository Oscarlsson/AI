This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's.  Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD.
