We all know how great the songs are on this CD -- 5-Star all the way.

However, I guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the SACD hybrid CD format of this particular reissue on our PC.  Which also means that we can't add the CD to our iTunes or iPod music selections.  In this day and age, that's severely limiting, so I regret this purchase (I don't have some jalopy of a PC/processor either, as my computer is less than seven months old, with 2GB of RAM).

I don't know who to blame for my "mistake" -- myself?  Amazon?  Sony?  Philips?  ABKCO?

I'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding "DSD-" or "SACD-" labeled items.

I'll also give the CD 1 Star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me
