I was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s. Unfortunately, instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music, what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated, with some Latin tones now and then. The only semi retro/electro tracks on here (and my favorites) are Feel For You, Love Bite, Your Love is Like a Drug, and Marc Almond's remix of Venus. The two lead singles "Move in My Direction" and "Look on the Floor" are not even the strongest tracks! And the remixes on their singles don't make them much better. 

I appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken, but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this. Take a listen to the new Madonna or even the Kelly Osbourne(!) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that don't melt down into total cheese. Unfortunately, I just don't see US radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc. 

But of course, fans of Bananarama should still add this one to their collection. It's listenable, if not up to today's standards
