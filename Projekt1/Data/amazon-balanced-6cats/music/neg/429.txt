I hate saying this as a HUGE Good Charlotte fan but their new album is just a major waste of money. Their first album is one of my top five albums of all time, but this one sucks. The songs are all dance pop synthesized junk. No real guitars, no messages to any of the songs, no nothing. I dont know if Joel is just too busy running around town with Nicole Richie or what but they skipped out on this album. The only redeaming song is The River, on which they colaberated with M Shadows and Synester Gates of Avenged Sevenfold. I hate hate hate to say it but dont waste your money or time on this one, just listen to the first album and remember what a great band they used to be.
