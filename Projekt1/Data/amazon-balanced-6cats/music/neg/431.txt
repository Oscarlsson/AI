I was so disappointed with this CD.  At least 6 of the songs were recorded from VERY OLD albums....scratches and all!  They were SO bad. I play two of the songs over and over...the only two I liked. When I read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs, I assumed that they meant doubles of the same song....I was wrong. I don't know WHY they had to add the scratchy music..a filler?  I would quickly skip to another song...only to have to "skip" many times!
