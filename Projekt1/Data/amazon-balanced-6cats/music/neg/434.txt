she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls! 

PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!! 

Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one!
