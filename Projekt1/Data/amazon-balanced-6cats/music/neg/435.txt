After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release.  To say the least I am disappointed.  I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep.  Where is the range of work?  All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating
