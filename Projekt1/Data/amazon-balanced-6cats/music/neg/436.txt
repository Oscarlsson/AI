This great underground master DJ deservedly gets a release on a major record label... but there are too many rappers, not enough personality in the production, and obvious restraint in the sampling (surely the result of copyright clearance issues.) Compared to Z-Trip's amazing and audacious Uneasy Listening with DJ-P and Live at the Future Primitive with Radar, this is just a bore... yawn...
