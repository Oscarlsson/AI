I bought this CD after having seen Ken Burns' special on PBS. The energy that came through on screen in the Benny Goodman segments doesn't really come through in this CD. Artie Shaw said that Benny Goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability. That shows in this collection. Afterall, where would Jazz be if Jazz musicians didn't take risks
