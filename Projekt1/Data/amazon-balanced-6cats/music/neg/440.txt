I heard that song recently &quot;Three Strange Days&quot;...and I recalled how much I detested it when it came out.  Overt pandering to tyros in altered states.  Now I can't get it out of my head, and may require a lobotomy.  There was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91; but this wasn't part of that canon.  Nice try School of Fish.  Have fun playing the CYO circuit
