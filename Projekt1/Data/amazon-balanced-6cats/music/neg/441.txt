I LOVED Shedaisy's first album The Whole Shebang.  And I also really enjoy their Christmas albumn.  They have beautiful voices and I love the three part harmonies they come up with.  I was very excited to get their newest album but I was sure dissapointed.  This is a very dark and depressing album.  Almost every song is about lost love.  Also, all the songs but 1 are slow.  Where is the upbeat Shedaisy I fell in love with???  I would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to The Whole Shebang again.  Still, I look forward to what the future may bring from them.  These sisters have alot of talent
