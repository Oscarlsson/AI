Most of these songs were previously sold on other albums from Martina. What a waste of money to buy this album of Mostly "old" songs and only a few new ones! Martina is sucking money out of the pockets of hard-working individuals. Maybe she should try getting a REAL job instead of using the average working person to support her lavish & luxurious lifestyle. Many of us are living in trailer parks & working 80 hours a week while Martina sitting on her a** in her million dollar house making money like rain! You, the people who are buying her albums are making her rich...what the hell is wrong with you people? Don't buy her albums and let her get a freakin' job so she can feel what it's like to work every day and actually earn a damn dollar! Martina, quit using poor people to accommodate your ridiculously high lifestyle
