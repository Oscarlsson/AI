 This was o.k. Nothing more nothing less. This album was hard to review, beacuse no songs really stick out. I mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes, laced over just above mediocre beats. I have heard better Sesame Street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van. 
 I mean what does the album have that sticks out? "Saturday To Saturday"? "Bloody Horseshoe"? Or the multi- faceted "Boo, We Ain't Forgot About You" None of the above, or none on the album.

Sorry. And please, all angry people who think that this is a bad review, remember, it's a REVIEW. I can say what I want
