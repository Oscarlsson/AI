Me especially I cannot hate on Cam cuz I got his first albums and thats when he was serious lyrically. Either the money went to his head or he just ran outta s*** to say. And judgin that his subject matter stays the same I guesss its true. Dude spits some retarded a** lyrics. I give this CD a two cuz of the beats. But this dude is a certified beatwaster. These producers need to give these beats to rappers who can actually spit bars. This n***a sumtimes don't even rhyme
