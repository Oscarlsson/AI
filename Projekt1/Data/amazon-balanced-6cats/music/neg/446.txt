Do not buy this CD.  He is definitely wack. His silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats. As a member of "Children of the Corn" he was weak and he still is weak.  The other member of his Dip-Set Crew outshine him on his own CD...how lame is that.  Through away any Cam'ron cd's you own and immediately replace them with music by Jay-Z.
