When the preview aired, I was pushing the movie to all my friends, based on the hilarity of the preview. At that time, I skeptically said, "I hope these don't turn out to be the only funny parts." and that was exactly what happened. The rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes, crass humor that went way over the line and kept running. The pee joke was funny once, but even at that one time they overdid it, then overdid it again, and then again. The Harry Potter parts were hilarious! Jack Sparrow was awesome! But I wished I had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie. It's another Scary Movie (1) deal, only worse! I love the newest Scary Movies, they are funny, but 1 really sucked. It was funny now and then, but a lot of it was stupid. So is Epic Movie, only worse. Don't waste your money buying it. Rent and fast forward.
