Ok, booty rap was good in the 90's, when it was offensive and raunchy like, 2 live crew, Disco Rick and The Dogs, Poison clan etc.....But this is just wack weak lyrics, corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same....And is it just me are these guys as rappers, just horrible there voices all raspy, and annoying and one the guy's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr.....( what is he on crack or something)So if you like radio friendly, pretty boy music then the Ying Yang twins are for you peace...
