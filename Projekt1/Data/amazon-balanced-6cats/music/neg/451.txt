Eric Reed is a monster pianist. Under the right circumstances, he could record a Christmas album that would become an instant classic. This, however, is an unfortunate example of what happens when an overconfident artist tries to do everything himself.

Reed produced and arranged this album himself. Probably if he had hired an objective producer, that producer would have told him to hire an arranger. Reed's arrangements are second-rate. His version of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" has been downshifted into a parody that serves as the worst example of an annoying trend: Reed attempts to put a fresh twist on nearly every song. It's an admirable goal, but he doesn't have what it takes; and the result is like a restaurant that serves hamburgers with a knife and fork, and swordfish crumbled over salad. It just doesn't work.

I hope this isn't the last Christmas album from Eric Reed. He's one of the truly original voices of his generation; and with his gospel background and feel for the blues, there's no doubt in my mind he could record an album that would rival "A Charlie Brown Christmas." But this isn't it. He needs to hand over the reins of his next project and focus on the piano
