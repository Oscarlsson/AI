Carlos Mencia is one edgy comedian; I know this because he won't stop telling everyone about it. I've never been a huge fan of Carlos and after listening to this CD my opinion of him hasn't really changed. He claims to be an edgy comedian and that's his problem, if he was truly edgy he wouldn't have to constantly remind us in his CD/DVD titles, his show on Comedy Central, radio/TV interviews and most importantly during his own act. Sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does Chris Rock, George Lopez, David Cross, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor (RIP) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it. In fact they are so good at it Mr. Mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian's jokes in his own act, a true sign of respect for those who came before them; at least that's what Carlos seems to think or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to come up with descent material. Needless to say I was not laughing while listening to this CD and it wasn't because I find Carlos to mean spirited, or crass, or politically incorrect; it's because everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is. There is so much good stand up comedy out there people don't waste your time and money on this joke stealing, self aggrandizing hack.
