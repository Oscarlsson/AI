I was really excited when I received Tone Poems III as a gift. Wow, Grisman and Brozman! Two amazing fret men playing some wonderful vintage instruments. I couldn't wait to hear some excellent acoustic bluesy slide and Reso music. Unfortunately, this recording comes across like sugar poured on the tongue. If you like sitting around in beach wear and listening to Hawaiian strumming-which is at least half of it-this is the recording for you. (In fairness, track 15, "Style O Blues," and track 20, "New Steal," are wonderful. They have some drive and get-up-and-go.)
    I also own Tone Poems I, which Grisman did with flatpicker extraodinaire Tony Rice. That recording is also mostly a lightweight. 
    I play mandolin and fiddle, and recognize David Grisman as the world's master with the mando. I also appreciate what he's doing with his Acoustic Disc recording label. These days, however, he seems to be better off when other musicians are running the show. The recent recordings with Vasser Clements and Old and in the Gray are great. "Hold On, We're Stummin'," with Sam Bush,is the best new mandolin record I've heard. Buy it and go to acoustic heaven!
    For my hard-earned money, however, the Tone Poems CDs have turned out to be an expensive set of matching drink coasters. I just know that musicians of this caliber, playing instruments of this quality, could have given us a better selection of music.
