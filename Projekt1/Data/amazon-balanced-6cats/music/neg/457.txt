Of the dozen tracks featured here, chances are the typical listener will only recognize four: &quot;Signs,&quot; &quot;Sweet City Woman,&quot; &quot;One Fine Morning&quot; and &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot; - and the last-named is out of sequence, having come out more than a year before the others.  The star of this show is Lighthouse's &quot;One Fine Morning,&quot; and Rhino must be praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the 45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter.  It's a shame, in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental, it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on &quot;Music From NFL Films&quot; - it had that quality about it.  As for the other eight offerings: If they wanted to pick some obscure stuff, why didn't they go all the way and throw in Dusk's &quot;Treat Me Like A Good Piece Of Candy?&quot
