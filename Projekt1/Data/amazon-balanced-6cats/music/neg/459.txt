Disappointing to see a man of Garbarek's gifts drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of MOR classical and soft world-beat markets. No one expects him to do a 'jazz' album nowadays but after a six-year recording hiatus we might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings he chooses. Sadly,the evidence on this release is of an artist who's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15 years now to the point of exhaustion; theres nothing here he hasn't said better on his previous three or four outings. All is not lost though, and there are moments of stark beauty here and there but they are mostly lost in a soft sticky morass of Garbarek cliches and the kind of uninspired composition better suited to a film soundtrack or TV documentary about some beautiful natural environment. Forget the misleading hype elsewhere and get hold of just about any of his albums from about 1972 through to 1987 and I guarantee you'll feel better for it
