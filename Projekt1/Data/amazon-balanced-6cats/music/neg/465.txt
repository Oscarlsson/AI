The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture. 

Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like "Terribile lo Sento", and "Orribile lo Scempio", "GI'otraggi" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic.
