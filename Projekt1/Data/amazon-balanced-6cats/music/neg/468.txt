Yes yes we all know the mega hit When I See You Smile. But it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole.

The band hits gear pretty early with Best of What I Got but after that it's pretty bad. How Possession ever became a hit I've not idea. Well, where I come from it didn't, but in the US this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits.

The production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album. Neil Schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck. Besides, he probably wanted some revenge on Steve Perry so he really wanted to make some cash. Pity, listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man. Rockin' Horse for example. 

An interesting additin to the AOR landscape, and some of the music is lively. But when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just doesn't get my vote. Even my devoted AOR fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track (we all know which one).

But hey, if AOR is your bag you could do a lot worse
