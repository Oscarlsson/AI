let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer.
