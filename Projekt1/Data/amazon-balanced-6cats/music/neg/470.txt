Before you all dismiss me as an obsessive, close-minded thrash fanatic; I thoroughly enjoyed "Chaos AD," which was a Sep' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal.

I like the idea of experimenting with tribal sounds, but with those sounds, Max decided to throw in downtuned guitars, not doing guitar solos, excessive profanity, lame "I hate this I hate that" lyrics, and guest musicians.  The only decent songs on here are "Roots Bloody Roots" and "Dictators***;" everything else is awful.  This isn't Sepultura, this is Soulfly.

I'm glad Max left because if he stayed in the band, Sep' would have degenerated into a nu-metal band.

For good Sepultura albums, get these instead (starting with the best):

Schizophrenia
Morbid Visions/Bestial Devastation
Beneath the Remains
Arise
Chaos AD
Dante XXI
Nation
Roorback

PS, you Max fanatics need to cut Derik Green some slack, he's keeping Sep' alive while Max is making an arse of himself with Soulfly
