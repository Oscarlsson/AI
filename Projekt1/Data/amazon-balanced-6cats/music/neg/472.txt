This completely lacks the charm and subtlety of the original.  Overblown, overproduced Mackintosh garbage. If he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage, I'm sure he wouldn't have hesitated.  Mr. Banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst. And the omission of "Sister Suffragettes" smacks of PC nonsense
