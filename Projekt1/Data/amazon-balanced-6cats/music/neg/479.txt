Forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today's "music" too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them, "Hollaback Girl" is the absolute DUMBEST "song" I've ever had the displeasure to hear.

There are two main parts to this travesty: 1. Where she says "That's my sh**" no less than a million times, and 2. She demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us.

If this is supposed to be rap, Stefani failed miserably.  If it's supposed to be dance, again, she failed miserably.  To be honest, I don't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music.  

The fact that it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't have any requirements for their ears.  - Donna Di Giacom
