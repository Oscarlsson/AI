I know, I know - I never thought it possible either, that Gwen Stefani could produce something more awful than anything her (ex?) band No Doubt and reduced to house-husband Gavin Rosdale's band Bush ever could combined. Take No Doubt's attempts at reggae, their use of guitars and trumpets (together? Never good), take.. well, every Bush song ever recorded and "Hollaback Girl" is STILL a hundred times worse. Let's talk about WHY.

First of all, that fake music thing I hate. If you've read any of my previous reviews (and if not, why not?) you'll know that if someone is singing something, even if they've written it or not, you've got to BELIEVE it. I mean, Aretha Franklin didn't write "Respect" (Otis Redding did), but when she sings it - you believe it. 

Not so with this, a laughable attempt at a football-chant soundalike.  Here, Gwen tells us that "uh-huh, this my s**t" and "this s**t is bananas".  And then helpfully spells out bananas, all under a "Hey Mickey" type repetitive drumbeat. Gwen attempts to sound a number of things..

a) 17
b) black
c) "street"
d) like she had any idea what the hell a "hollaback girl" actually WAS until someone told her a week before the song was written.

She fails on all accounts.  What she DOES come across as being is everything that, well, she is. A white, 35 year old rich married woman bringing in expensive young talent to help her sell albums.

It's not only an unconvinving song, but a crass, ugly, tedious NOISE.  But it has the word "s**t" repeated loads and loads of times, so of course it sold by the bucketload. Sigh and double sigh.

I shudder to think what she'll come up with next to top it. Gwen Gangsta Rap?
