Atleast they are trying this time around. Still no where near as good as the band was with Max. 

Pros: Faster and more back to their roots than the other releases without Max at the helm. Guitar playing is passable.

Cons: Lack of solos. Derrick is still lacking as a vocalist. Just isn't as good as old Sepultura, songs lack hooks and are mostly forgetable.

Bottom Line: This album falls short of expectations. The current Sepultura is nothing more than a very average metal band at best. If you like old Sepultura I suggest you not waste your money on this, but then again you might like it. Buyer beware
