Neither the Amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact. I have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'Songs for Swinging Lovers' - Frank Sinatra or Beethoven's Opera Fidelio - conductor Otto Klemperer (Testament Label). The material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings. I did not hear anything outstanding on this CD to make me overlook the 'mono' factor. 

Is this some great jazz masterpiece, recorded live in Carnegie Hall by two giants of Jazz? I personally don't think so. Somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then Elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old.

With small jazz bands, I like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis. 
Examples: 'Sunday at the Village Vanguard - Bill Evans Trio' or 'New York Reunion - McCoy Tyner Quartet'. I wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording. This material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados. It may have been hasty but after one listen I decided to sell this CD and I have no regrets other than buying it in the first place.
