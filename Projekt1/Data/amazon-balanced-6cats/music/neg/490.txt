i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan.  i'm a huge pet sounds fan, but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from "the left banke" to "beulah."  this album is not that good, people.  it's not even "okay."  there are way better takes on the "brian wilson" (read: phil spector) sound.  whether it's "the ladybug transistor" or "the apples in stereo."  heck, check out a great vancouver band called "ashley park" as well. the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable.  they may be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album, especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops "a la stone roses."  you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label's recordings or even merge stuff.  to be honest, i didn't even find the compositions that scintillating, regardless of the production.  chord and change-wise, they're interesting....but that doesn't make the songs good.
