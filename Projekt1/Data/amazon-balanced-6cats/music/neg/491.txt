I purchased this disk along with others to play in my Acura DVD-A system.  I found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit "over the top" with surround effects.  Major vocals coming from rear speakers, etc. 

I also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk. In fact, the demo disk for my TL has the Marvin Gaye song "Let's Get It On" and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection.

If you are looking for DVD-A disks with 5.1 surround...I'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the CD of this album.
