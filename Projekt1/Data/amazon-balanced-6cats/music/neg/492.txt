Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable  in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here
