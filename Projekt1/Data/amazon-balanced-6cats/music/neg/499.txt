I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though
