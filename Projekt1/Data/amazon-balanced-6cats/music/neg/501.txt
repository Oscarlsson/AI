well i'll explain that later. she uses her own vocals. she doesn't even have the balls to let the artists who rework the song use their own vocals.I love how the editoral review uses the term "unique vocal TALENT". Yoko has no vocal talents. I must also point out I am Courtney Love's number one fan, so this should give me even more cred. 

It just proves how narcissistic and disgusting yoko is that she won't let other artists do an album using their own vox. She loves the sound of her own too much!

I already went through that stage where I made everyone listen her as a joke. I was about 14 then. My point here, this isn't even a good joke. 

Its just dumb.

I listened to the song clips provided on amazon. even that was too much.

if you must, just download this album for free. Do not buy it. Do not in any way support this woman. 

I wish there was a zero star rating.
