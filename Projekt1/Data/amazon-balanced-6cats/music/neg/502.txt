I ordered this cd based on the reviews. First, I have to say that I am not sure why it is called 'Paris Under a Groove'. I was thinking that it would be in French, at least. The beats are nice, I would not in any way compare it to Buddha Bar.. I just wasn't as thrilled as I thought that I would be. It sounded very cheap. No originality. My fiancee is from Paris, and this was very disappointing- not only to him- but I was embarrassed as offering it as a present....So far, it sits on the shelf..
