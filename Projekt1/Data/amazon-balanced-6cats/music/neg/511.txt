AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber. 

Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.
