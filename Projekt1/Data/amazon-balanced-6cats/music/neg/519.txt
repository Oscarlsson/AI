As if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough, its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound. This band sounds like a even more flaccid Killswitch Engage, a Hawthorne Heights/Silverstein with downtuned guitars. As if it wasnt an abomination already, they even sing about vampires. Yes, thats right, vampires. 

And you couldnt get any g*yer.
