Man, have I given this guy a chance.  Multiple chances.  Listened to the CDs, saw the big HBO special.  I mean, his career is red hot now.  He clearly has lots of fans.  Mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you).  All I can say is "maybe they'll grow out of it."  He is NOT funny.  His act has no bite, no point of view, no opinion/viewpoint at all.  His comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the "this is all happened to us" or "has this ever happened to you?" school of humor).  He runs about manically, acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words).  His fans acknowledge that, yes, they can relate.  "Yeah!  That's happened to me!"  "I know that reference!'  They laugh, cheer, clap, and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit.  He never actually COMMENTS on the things he discusses in any intelligent, interesting way.  He has no edge.  He's not outraged by anything.  He's cute 'n' cuddly.  Richard Pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that Cook is classified as a stand up comic.  "Pryor?  The guy writing this must be OLD!'  Okay, try this on for size:  Chris Rock is good comedy.  Same with Dave Chappelle.  Carlin.  Laura Kightlinger.  Kinison.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Bob Saget.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Dom Irrera.  Lewis Black.  Robert Klein.  The late Mitch Hedberg.  Jim Norton.  Patton Oswalt.  Brian Posehn.  DeGeneres.  Jon Stewart.  Bob & David.  The UCB.  I'm not even a big fan of Sarah Silverman, but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party.  Anything but this!  God help us.  Let's hope he goes the way of Carrot Top and Dice soon (don't forget, Cook fans, Mr. Top and Mr. Clay were once as popular as your boy here)
