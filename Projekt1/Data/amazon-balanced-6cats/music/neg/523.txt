After really enjoying the Amici Forever album, I went shopping for another Amici album and found this one.  There really is no comparison between the two.  I've tried listening to it several times to see if I'm missing something, but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the Lawrence Welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe. I was very disappointed
