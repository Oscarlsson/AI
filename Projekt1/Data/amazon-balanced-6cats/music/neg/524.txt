Hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world, and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums. The only dofference is that they have gotten worse. I write this review to the two groups of people out there: The exisiting Hammerfall fans, and those trying them out for the first time. For already existing Hammerfall fans such as myslef, I strongly urge that you do not buy this cd, unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon. For those looking to try Hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time, go ahead and get this one, because Hammerfall are by no means bad musicians. They can all play very well, but this cd lacks refinement and creativity. Start here and work your way up to the better Hammerfall, which you will no doubt appreciate more. Hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over, if you know what I mean. All of their songs sound relatively similar, but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career
