Young Jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper; yet, he is a motivational speaker.  So, in this case, he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do.  He should just consider himself a rapper; that way, when he's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across, we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model.

Anyways, with that diatribe aside, this album is nothing new from Jeezy.  We all saw it coming.  He picks out some great beats, but cannot provide the great lyrics to go along with them.  Therefore, an uneven album ensues.  "I Luv It" was the first single and is a prime example.  If this beat might have reached someone such as T.I. or maybe even a group like Clipse, this would've been a great song.  However, it's Jeezy, so it's gonna be a letdown.  

That's pretty much what this album is; a letdown.  After guest spots on "Grew Up a Screw Up" with Ludacris and the posse cut remix "Top Back" with T.I. & B.G., i was expecting alot from Jeezy this time around.  However, all i got were two tracks ("Go Getta" with R. Kelly & "3 A.M." with Timbaland) that are recommendable.  The rest of the album is plagued with horrible lyrics over average-to-above average production.  If you're looking for "inspiration," look away from this "trap-star.
