Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis?  &quot;Spankmaster&quot; represents a regression of creative energy.  It sounds like Keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks.  It contains little of the genius of his earlier CDs.  With the exception of a couple songs (&quot;jewelry shine&quot; and &quot;Blackula&quot;), this album stinks
