This CD is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical.

A better alternative would be to listen to either:
a) the original artists who influenced this band 
or
b) someone at least trying to do something new with music.

To enjoy this CD you'd have to really want to like this band, either because you liked Dig or because you're attracted to their super-cool reputation.

If you're afraid you're missing out on something by not owning BJM's back catalogue don't worry, you're not.
