Don Caballero have always had members leave, but this is ridiculous.  Che is not Don Cab even if he is an amazing drummer and started the band.  Ian Williams for one is a huge reason for the Don Caballero sound that I always gravitated towards and without him the band is incomplete.  Why Che decided on naming this new group under the Don Caballero name rather than Speaking Canaries or something else baffles me.  More importantly, the music is BORING on this album.  It's like the new members only influences were Yes and ELP sans vocals.  In other words, no spontaneity, hardly and time changes or dynamics and weak predictible guitar/bass lines.  Avoid this album like the plague and pick up any of the Battles EPs or better yet get the real Don Cab works like Singles Breaking Up or What Burns.  There is a ton of other great instrumental bands old and new in this type of vein that blow this "new" Don Caballero to pieces
