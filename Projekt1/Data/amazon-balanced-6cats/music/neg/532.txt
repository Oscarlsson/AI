Outside of 'Curious' sung by Tina Cousins, this album is a dud -- at least by 'Believe' standards. Most songs sound similar with the same beat. The album won't make your ears bleed, but the band should have quit calling itself '4 Strings' after the departure of Vanessa. It is a very different band now, and should not tease 'Believe' fans into thinking another 4 Strings album of simliar quality and vocals is being released. I would buy 'Curious' if it can be purchased separately, but would skip buying this album. If a future reviewer knows where Vanessa ended up, please let me know. The mixers of the group are talented, but Vanessa was the real star
