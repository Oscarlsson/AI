I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux.  Everything after that is garbage.  This album is no exception.  Every song sounds the same and is very predictable.  The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses?  He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money.  He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again
