Sounds like it should be in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy.

Did they intentionally try to erase his personality? Sounds like it was produced in Nashville!  This should be a demo for another singer to record.

It's just too schmaltzy for me.  I think Phil Ramone may be slipping too.  Billy is a much better singer than this.

After listening to this song I instinctively lit a match.  I'm going to go listen to Glass Houses
