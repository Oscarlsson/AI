I don't know who these people are, but they will give praise for ANYTHING!  Ms. London is a wonderful singer, but the producers must have given her sleeping pills.  This is a boring CD!  Like Peggi Blu, who won Star Search, her record company "toned her down" for her debut album, with banal and boring songs with that stupid hip/hop "dum de dum" Mary J. Blige beat, which will send you to nowheresville.  

Aretha Franklin's boring SO DAMN HAPPY was so awful, it's no longer available.  She went "Mary J." and almost lost the crown off her head.  Because she's Aretha Franklin (Queen of Soul) she DID manage (somehow) to get a non-deserved Grammy for "Wonderful" from that CD.  The Grammys also presented The Queen with her 17th competitive Grammy for her "A House Is Not A Home" mess.  What MUST they be thinking?

Well, LaToya London won't be considered for ANYTHING for this hip/hop mess.  She should get serious about some R & B (I mean the REAL r & b) and leave this light-weight fluff alone.  LaToya, you have a great voice -- use it.  Contact Sam Dees, Jo Armstead or Ashford & Simpson and BEG for some material! And, as Madame Rose would say, "Sing Out, Louise!!!
