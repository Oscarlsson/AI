As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.

Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.

Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit...
