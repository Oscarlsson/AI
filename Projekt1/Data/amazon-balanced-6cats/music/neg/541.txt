Being a huge Blondie fan, I WANT to rate this one higher, but sadly I cannot. It's just a sad mishmash of bad songs, it feel very negligant too. I love the way Blondie contributed to rap and disco, but their calypso number on this one is so awful. They had lost it here.

Check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat..
