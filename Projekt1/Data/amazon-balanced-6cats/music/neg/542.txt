You'll find better works out there, particularly if you're a Miles fan.   The emphasis here is on Milt Jackson and his vibraphone, which gives the  album a light, airy feeling.  Missing is much of Miles' horn and sentiment.   You also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music.  I would  call this a &quot;pleasant&quot; album, which in my jazz-world is not a  happy thing
