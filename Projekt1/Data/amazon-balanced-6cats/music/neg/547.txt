John Coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine. Wynton and the LCJO are in effect the death of creative musicians like Coltrane, or most of the truly creative Jazz scene for that matter. Wynton is establishing himself as "the face of Jazz". A market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making Jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music. By telling us (and make no mistake, these guys do...): "this is what Jazz is" and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of Jazz giants such as John Coltrane who, if he were alive, would not be given the time of day by these folks, Wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music. 
The recording, since I must talk about it, features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what Coltrane was, mostly empty of content, setting in motions soloists who sound more like "Jazz puppets" than anything remotely close to what Coltrane was striving for (notable exception: Ted Nash !).
You do NOT need this record. Wynton and the LCJO does NOT need your money; spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge, the way Coltrane did
