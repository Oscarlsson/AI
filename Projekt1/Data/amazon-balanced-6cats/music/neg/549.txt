Most people seem to like the soundtrack from"Glory",but this fact does not necessarily make"Glory"a great,or even good soundtrack...Most people also like the food served atMacdonald's,but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...It is something to put in one's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...The same might be said regarding"Glory"...If one's tastes run to choir music,almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...As for the themes,they are commonplace variations,often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer,or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores,so,all in all,the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap,"homestyle"diner...The film,on the other hand,was well done,and,apparently,from reading many of the other reviews here,the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself,rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.Horner has written a lot of really,really beautiful and original scores,but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...So,in sum,we are left with a very popular film,provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer
