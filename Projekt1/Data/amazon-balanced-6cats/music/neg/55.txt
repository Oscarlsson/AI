Bought this CD based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums I like, and man, what a mistake. This CD borders on unlistenable, with no discernable melody/talent to be found. I'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...I consider "Blueberry Boat" to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible
