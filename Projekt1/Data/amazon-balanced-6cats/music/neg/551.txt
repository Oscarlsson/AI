After chancing upon Galactic's rather remarkable live show at a local bar, I jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc. Wasn't worth the effort, I'm afraid. Velveeta on Wonder Bread-dull collection of acid jazz  duds. Not bad as background noise for your next dinner party, but captures  exactly none of the blood and soul that make Galactic such a great live  act. A pass for all but Galactic completeists, if such an animal exists
