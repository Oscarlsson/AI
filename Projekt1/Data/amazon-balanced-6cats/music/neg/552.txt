Okay, here is the major problem with this release: it is not a TuffGong/Island release. The Marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time. Because Bob's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that American and European recording artists have enjoyed for decades, his recordings have gone onto the cheap market (flea markets, push carts, gas stations, etc-and now Amazon). Buying One Love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the Jamaican economy. Look closely at the albums before you buy them. Find out what label has produced them and try to stick with TuffGong when possible.
