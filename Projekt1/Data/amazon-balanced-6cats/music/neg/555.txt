When the Airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit' 'somebody to love' they were a force to be reckoned with, but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed. Now i happen to think that Jack Cassidy just about saves the band with that bass, but even he can't stop the monotony of 'bear melt' and 'rock me baby' surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to JOrma Kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. The guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a Hot Tuna gig. Anyone who saw the clip in Woodstock will know what i mean..No wonder Hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!Occasionally the band get it together and Balin and Slick's vocals mesh together brilliant, but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate. Face it when it comes down to it very few West Coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say Cream or Ten years after. As i said Casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear. It's better than 'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. If you think that 'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set, but i just think its sleep inducing
