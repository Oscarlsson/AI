Camera Obscura is similar, in an inferior manner, to Nico, of the Velvet Underground & Nico.  The band makes pleasantly dull "chamber pop" in the vein of Belle & Sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years.  Even their name is ripped off of Nico's last studio album, Camera Obscura.  But, as I said before, Camera Obscura is much worse than Nico.  If you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like, pick up "Chelsea Girl," Nico's first solo album
