This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.  

It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.

That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  "Whatever Happened to Christmas", "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary".  I also liked the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch".  That seems to suit her more.

Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars
