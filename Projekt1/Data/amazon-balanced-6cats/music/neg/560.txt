Someone suggested I listen to this because I was, at the time, into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call "creatively aggresive" music.  Then it was death metal (which I prefer without cursing or filth, you understand.)  Since then I've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore.

Anyway, Mr. Bungle.... tepid.  Uninteresting.  Bland.  Stupid.  Gives the chin-strokers something to fascinate over.  Let them.  Someone's got the fuel the economy
