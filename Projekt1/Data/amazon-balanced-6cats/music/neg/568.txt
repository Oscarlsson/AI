First they started out as nu-metal, then they moved onto metalcore, and now psuedo-death metal. It should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends, and after each trend dies, they just move on to another one. If my calculations are correct, expect a psuedo-black metal release.

But, what about the musicians? Sure, they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot, then they have two guitarists...who like to steal Pantera riffs, and then they have the singer, who, well, sounds just like all the rest. Atleast they dont have the DJ anymore (oh wait, they do, nevermind.)

Enough of my rambling, how does this untalented group of posers fair up? Well, image if Mushroomhead went metalcore. 'Nuff said.
