Most other reviewers listed here believe that this CD is good - I wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary Mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier Mannheim CD's have made it difficult to critique a Mannheim offering!  I am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular CD sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music, just with different chords.  In fact, if I was not paying specific attention, I couldn't tell when one song ended and another started!  I enjoyed what I heard, but I was certainly expecting more from this CD - many of these Disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least, some variety seems to have been called for.  Disney has always included great music with their movies, running the gamut of musical styles such as classical, jazz, blues, and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high.  I do, however, highly recommend Mannheim CD's in general - just not this one
