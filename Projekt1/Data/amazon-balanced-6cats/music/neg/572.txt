After two albums of wholly instrumental music, Joe Satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing.  "Flying in a Blue Dream" is the only Satriani record with several (six) vocal cuts.

So how are they?  Well, Satch's voice isn't superb, but he does an ok job.  The problem really is with the material-- it's clear he'd gotten used to writing pieces as guitar features.  The only real exception to this in my assessment is frantic electric blues "Big Bad Moon"-- the piece is blazing and explosive, the vocal is passable, and Satriani is on fire.  But pieces like "Ride", "The Phone Call" and "Strange" are all pretty much forgettable (well, "Ride" is actually a bit too irritating to be forgettable...).

The remainder of the material is a mix between exploratory (and primarily acoustic) pieces ("The Feeling") which are nice but largley filler and "Surfing With the Alien" styled instrumentals ("One Big Rush", "Back to Shalla-Bal").  The exception is the chugging opener and title track, "Flying in a Blue Dream", which features Satriani at his most lyrical as a guitarist.

Invariably, the album is a bit too weak for its own good-- it's probably also a bit too long (about 65 minutes) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed down a bit.  Start with "Surfing With the Alien", come back to this if you want more of the same
