My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours, too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century."  Well, I'm so glad that Columbia cleared that up.  Otherwise, I'd have had to make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays.  I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart, and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis).

Scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening, but not in such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles, let alone 22. Halfway through this CD, I felt as if I were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox.  For all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at Scott--no one else like him, no way to categorize his music, and so on, and so on--the reality is that composers and arrangers like Ferde Grofe, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Alec Templeton, and Bill Challis covered the same ground far more skillfully--and, in most instances, earlier--than Scott.  Concert jazz, symphonic jazz, or whatever you wish to call it, was NOT the invention of any one man, and certainly not Scott.  Check out Grofe's scores for Whiteman--in particular, his writing for woodwinds and his constant, Scott-esque use of muted trumpet.  Listen to Duke Ellington's "extended" compositions circa 1929.  For that matter, listen to Ellington's 1933 "Daybreak Express"--virtually the template for Scott's galloping miniatures.  Experience Bill Challis and Glenn Miller's pioneering big band charts.  Or... believe as you're told to believe, i.e. that Scott, and Scott alone, performed this kind of music.  I mean, who needs history when we've got hype?  It's up to YOU, dear listener
