I do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album.  There is nothing new or 'fresh' or 'original' or at all thought-brovoking about this music, unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound.  I have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music, but I was introduced to it through artists like Arab on Radar and Scissor Girls.  So when I tried out my first Sonic Youth album, I was way more than dissapointed.  I don't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore.  Sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word, but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band.  The most notable anything is the catchy medlody of Becuz.  It is really catchy, yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical "catchy tunes" ethos.  Xiu Xiu's "Knife Play" would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave... AND still retain the emotional pop sinsibility.  I don't know.. All I know is that Wasing Machine is a letdown.  It does not reach me artistically by a long shot.  Emotionally, I can think of am million other artists (Mars Volta, Emerson Lake & Palmer, cLOUDDEAD, Ulver, Edvard Greig!) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition.  This however is far to cheezy, and I don't know, but I think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique..
