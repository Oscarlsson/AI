Here's a line from the song Vato on this album: "I wouldn't be the n_____ that I am if I didn't pop n____z in the mouth."

Isn't that poetic? Snoop Dogg manages to pull off an amazing feat. He makes sex, drugs and violence seem so ... boring. I feel like I am supposed to be offended. But it's too boring to be offensive. We have songs about every kind of gang violence, every kind of drug, and every kind of cheap sex. And what are we left with?

He gets two stars because his approach to the city of Los Angeles is fresh and loving. Hip Hop should be local, and he does a good job with that. Otherwise it'd be a one-star
