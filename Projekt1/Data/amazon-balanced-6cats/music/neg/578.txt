This recording is not great company.  I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording?  And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage?  I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show.  The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show.  So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it!  Some things are just perfect the way they are.  Don't buy this CD.  I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use
