First Bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician. It seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary. Here's what chaps my hide the most. Bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch. It burns me too no end when a person calls himself a &quot;jazz&quot; guitarist, but doesn't really have any chops. I know Bill has been called anti-technique, but what does that really mean? Would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well, but really isn't very good at what he/she does? This guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time I turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face. I've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years. When I have guys that actually debate me that Bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say Pat Martino, or that Bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like Pat Martino, I have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like Pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that Frisell couldn't imagine. Is Bill Frisell a Jazz musician, No! Maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. For me I'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......Johnny Smith, Peter Leitch, Jim Hall, Pat Martino, Kenny Burrell, Billy Bauer, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Jimmy Bruno, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery and so on
