There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing. 
Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary "Toxic" and a marvelous vocal mix version of "Everytime" - another star for that.
