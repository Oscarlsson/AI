I have *NOT* listened to this album in full. I am, however, completely turned off by the fidelity of all the samples I have just listened to. There's NO excuse for an album sounding that bad in '69. Ghad, there was Zeppelin, Hendrix, Clapton, Miles - who recorded this thing?

All musicians on this CD are superlative examples of their mastery of their instruments, but the above reviewers in general are correct. Holdsworth MADE Lifetime along with Tony William's kick-ass drumming, and most probably insisted - perfectionist that he was, and still is - that it *sounded* like something other than a bootleg.

Personally, I'd regard this as something a collector should have - it's for a devotee, not for someone trying to access the genre for the first time because the fidelity is just darn terrible - and one of the above reviewers is so correct. It's like Dylan looking for his "Girl From The North Country", or "Knocking on Heaven's Door". At least they let Tony Williams in so he wouldn't sing any more!

All gags aside, a dissapointing effort. Overpriced, but one to have if you are a collector. You have to strain to hear the seed of what was to become Holdsworth's version of Lifetime, which I have not forgotten for 30 plus years. A quantum difference in fidelity, and quality of music. I'd rather buy Tony William's Lifetime Collection if I had to make the choice. I'd be tempted to pick this one up on peer to peer if I was desperate... Very UNimpressed
