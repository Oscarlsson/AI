I read several different on-line reviews for this CD before I purchased it. Each seemed to imply that this CD was a new direction for Jaci, that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature. Strange. I must have purchsed the Prozac copy of this CD because there is nothing new here from her. Like my title line to this review states, it's the exact same music she has always sang, just in a different package. Now the CD just collects dust. What a shame
