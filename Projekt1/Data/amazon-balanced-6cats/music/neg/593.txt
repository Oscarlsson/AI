Unlike most other items I've bought from Amazon, I failed to read the reviews for this particular CD before purchasing.  Being a fan of the Final Fantasy series, I think I fell into a bit of the "fanboy" (well in my case, "fangirl" I guess) syndrome.  Also I didn't do my homework at all and thought this was an orchestrated recording, which it most certainly is not.

I own most of the Final Fantasy OST's (and heartily endorse them for fans of the games) and this particular CD does nothing new or compelling to the music.  Tracks 1-7 are pretty much carbon copies of their OST counterparts.  Track 8, the opening theme of FFVIII (Liberi Fatali) has a very odd synth-solo vocal mix covering what is in the original a very moving choral section.  Tracks 9-11 again are basically copies of the OST.  Track 12, "Alexandria (Vivi's Theme)" is the only somewhat-original track, as it seems to put together several pieces from the FFIX soundtrack in a medley of sorts.

Unless you are a rabid fan who must have everything FF, I recommend saving up and purchasing the real OST's instead of this disc.  While I don't see non-fans flocking to purchase this disc, it might be worthwile if you're only slightly interested in the series and want a taste.  Even in that event I'd be worried this disc would turn those people off from the series entirely.

Pros:  
Cheap (I paid $6, new)
Track 12 is worth a listen

Cons:
Tracks 1-7, 9-11 offer nothing much new or different
Track 8 has creepy (in a bad way) synth/voice mixe
