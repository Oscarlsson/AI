Ok......AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!! As luck would have it I found it a a garage sale.  The only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is ViVi's Theme from FF9.  The others well....They could have done better.  Most of the songs are to put it nicely......SUCK (At least the way they where done).  The only reason I rated 2 (1 1/2 to be accualy) is because of ViVi's Theme at the end.  This is not whorth your time.  Get the imported CD's they have much better music on them
