These guys were the nirvana of r&b,
motown, soul, black music in the 90s. As nirvana
was the band that ended good white music.
boyz to men was the band that ended good black music.
I am kinda pissed because nobody seems to notice
it like i do. These guys especially the lead singer would 
always sing, oh wah oh wah oh oh ohhh oh after every sentence.
I mean compare these guys to kool and the gang or the commodores or rick james.
i could name tons and im not really a fan of soul type music.
barry white, whitney houston, bobby brown, the temptations
Isaac hayes luther vandross.  
i mean in the 90s i think almost every r&b group was
better than boyz to girls. i dont understand why
these guys are so popular.
I guess its just like seinfeld it sucks bad
but people like it. its like all these idiots
were born yesterday forgetting about quality
music and sitcoms from the past that were better.
