The problem with America was that started out great.  The first album was fresh and different from everything.  Three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own.  "Horse with no name" and "SandMan", was what pave the way for them.  The problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop. They should of left "Muskrat Love." to the Captain and Tennille.

This album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end.  The problem was that there was their first two albums, ( America and Venture Highway) and there was their others.

My recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans
