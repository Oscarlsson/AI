Well, the labels did it again. First, when they released the album "Dream" on cd. Their biggest hit from that album "You never done it like that" turned out to be a re-recorded version on the cd release.
They did it again with this "Ultimate Collection." That being said, I love some of their other hits, especially "The way that I want to touch you." Luckily, the rest of the tracks are the originals. If you're looking for the original version of "You never done it like that", you would have to get the 20th Century Masters collection of theirs
