I'm sorry to vent on the Stylistics, certainly others are guilty of this, but $33 to get all the Stylistics hits is WAY too expensive.  Sorry, love the Stylistics, and the Spinners too (whose double CD anthology is around $30 too).  Why is something like Lionel Richie and the Commodores 2CD Gold $13.99?  Oh well... I'll wait
