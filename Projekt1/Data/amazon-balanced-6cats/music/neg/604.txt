As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out.  With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings.  This cd got stale fast.  Seems to be geared to the tween crowd.  I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past
