This CD and the one entitled" Night Ranger's Greatest Hits are almost identical, but are different in this way:

"Best" contains "I Did It For Love". "Greatest" contains, instead, "Rumours In The Air" and "Restless Kind". The other 10 tracks on each CD are the same. So, which one to buy? My choice is the one with the extra track. Also, in my opinion, both tracks on "Greatest" are better than the one on "Best".

In addition, here's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a true "Greatest Hits" or "Best Of" album that will contain about 15 or 16 songs. Or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will include some rare tracks. 

Night Ranger fans would surely delight to see something like that
