Hey folks, this is brilliant and all, like the articles say, but what they don't mention is that it's impossible to listen to. There are no verses, choruses, or even beats to speak of. There are no songs. It's just a sound collage or something, from start to finish. The booklet prints lyrics but I couldn't find 'em. This music is too brilliant for its own good. And you can forget about using it as party or background music. JDub's other offerings are much better
