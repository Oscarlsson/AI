This album is the worst DCFC album, why......... Ill tell you why its boring, its repetitive, its way to mellow and im all for mellow but this is ridculous. I mean this is the type of mellow that puts people to sleep, especially the last track. OH MY GOD!!! THAT SONG IS SOOOOO BORING, its called Stability and it will put you to sleep. I am a fan of DFCF and i loved their other albums WE HAVE THE FACTS, PLANS, etc..... but honestly this album did not click with me. i tried listing to the songs again to see if i would probably grow accustome to it, but no that didnt work. Sure this album has its moments, but trust me when i say your not missing out on anything. I would not buy the album, instead buy the 2 stand out songs off itunes or napster; A MOVIE SCRIPT ENDING and WE LAUGH INDOORS. The only 2 stand out tracks
