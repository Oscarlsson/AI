My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.  It is advertised as the Cheetah Girls 2 - however these vocals are not sung by the original Cheetah Girls who are in the movie.  The songs just don't sound the same.  It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD
