I bought this disc hoping for pristine remastered sound and what I got was shrill noise with all the hiss sucked out. The guy who typed a review in all caps is a moron! It's better than an MFSL disc because the artist approved it? Yeah right! Get real! I might need a new hi-fi if I don't like the sound? Please! You idiots know nothing about what good sound quality is and either does Peter Mew or Rob Caiger. Thanks for nothing!

Sony should be sued by people who bought this horrible disc for deceptive practices...saying that the full-length version of "Roll Over Beethoven" was used! What a crock! And so what if they used the original master tapes? Using a master tape doesn't mean anything if you're going to smother it in noise processing and master it poorly! 

Don't buy this disc! Hang onto the old US versions, or even better, the Japanese issue. Don't give Sony your money for this shambles of a product
