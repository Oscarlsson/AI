Hey, BRRRRRUUUUUCCCE!

What's the deal? Just about every major Top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated EXCEPT YOURS.

Why can we buy the "Tracks" editions, and get glorious HDCD-encoded sound, but "Town" sounds like it's coming out an AM radio?

OK, you did your best, but Dubya's back in the White House for the next four years, and Kerry's home in his underwear watching the Weather Channel. You should have plenty of time on your hands now... GET BUSY!

Let's see some remastering!
