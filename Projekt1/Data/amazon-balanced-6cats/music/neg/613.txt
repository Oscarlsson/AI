Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.  This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set
