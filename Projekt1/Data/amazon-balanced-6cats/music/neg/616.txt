This is a saccharine and banal take on Irish music, with all the emotional intesity of a Hummel figuraine.  Upon first listen, I remarked to my wife that they sounded more like Peter, Paul, and Mary than the Dubliners. She correctly pointed out that Peter, Paul, and Mary were actually much better than this pablum, and that the Irish Rovers more closely resemble the fictional Main Street Singers from a Mighty Wind. 

Truly, absolutely, unlistenably passionless, cloying and bland
