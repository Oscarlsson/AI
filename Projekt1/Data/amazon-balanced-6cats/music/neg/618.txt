I love running to the Marine Corps Cadence CDs.  Volumes 1 and 2 are very good.  Volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral.  When running vols 1 & 2 are better synched for continuous running.  The transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me.  Others don't seem to agree and I still run to this CD;  I'd buy 1 and 2 first if you don't have them
