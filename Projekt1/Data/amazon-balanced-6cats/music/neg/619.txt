I like these guys alot.I own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live. I played this Cd a few times liked it at first, but it didn't grow on me at all liked I'd hoped.To cute for me,not spontaneous enough.I feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.Just let it rip guys,that's what you do best.Thank god my brother bought this instead of me.I bought live at cow palace (The Dead) great Cd
