  Paul Brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music. However, content on his latest project, "White Sand" isn't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums. The artist collaborations on "White Sand" make it tempting to purchase, but you quickly realize Brown's musical wittiness and versatility (Smooth, Latin or R&B) are lacking. Overall it is still a CD worth paying for
