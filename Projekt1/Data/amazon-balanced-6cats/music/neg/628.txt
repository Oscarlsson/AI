Imagine buying this CD after seeing "The Mirror has Two Faces" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon.  Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a "free album" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation
