&quot;Modern&quot; usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the Cars, Flock of Seagulls, or somesuch.  It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop.  The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are  basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics  and great hooks.  I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch  Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy &quot;Operator's Manual&quot; or  &quot;Going Steady.&quot;  Or dig up the amazing &quot;Different Kind of  Tension&quot; from a used record store somewhere!  Also, see them live if  you have a chance
