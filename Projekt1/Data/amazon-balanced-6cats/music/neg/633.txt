As a 21 year old, I felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack.  But, I was so excited that I had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies.  Imagine my disappointment when I could aurally pick out that Rosemary Clooney's parts were not sung by Rosemary Clooney!  I DO NOT recommend buying this album.  Enjoy the music when you watch the movies, instead.  Trust me, it's better that way
