Think twice before purchase:
1. Most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected "All-Time Top 100 TV Themes", along with the best themes from other networks.
2. This disc has CDS-100 copy protection, so you probably can't upload to Windows Media and definitely not to iTunes.
I could not upload from my internal CD drive, only from an external multi-format CD/DVD burner. It still only uploaded to Windows Media, not iTunes.
To get into iTunes, I had to add the WMA files and then convert them to MP3.
This probably caused some quality loss as I'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format!
A time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on "controlling" everything.
Hello record execs: If nobody can add your discs to their libraries, guess what happens? They DON'T PLAY YOUR MUSIC!!!
You might think you're protecting your valuable investment, but you're shooting yourself in the foot instead. Here's how it goes:
1. Nobody can upload your music.
2. Nobody plays your music.
3. Nobody hears your music.
4. Nobody recommends your music.
5. Nobody buys your music.
Remember, this only loaded from a particular kind of drive, so it may or may not work on yours.
