It just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become. Nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance: Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, and now Paris Hilton? LMAO! No seriously though, I'm still totally not sure how Paris Hilton became so famous. Yes, I know she's the Hilton Hotel Heiress, but I'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention. All she did was live off her family fortune, but now thanks to that fortune, she was able to get the right contacts, to make her own record label called "heiress records" which is a sub-label of Warner Bros. After a reality show series, modeling career, A sex tape, and a couple of roles in a few movies, what did she think to herself? I think I want to be a singer now? Apparently. And thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about. "Stars are Blind" is her first single off her debut album "Paris" and let me tell you it's nothing new or original. The song has kind of a ska beat, which I really don't think much of. Her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon, and the lyrics are mediocre. Sorry Paris , but you failed miserably as a musician. Leave this profession for the people that really have the talent
