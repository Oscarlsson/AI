I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.

Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.

Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.

Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it.
