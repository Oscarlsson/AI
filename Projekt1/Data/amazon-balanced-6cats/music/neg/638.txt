Bread8, that's one of the stupidest comments I've ever read.  You don't know s*** about metal.  You can't handle the intensity of real metal because you're a fat virgin who'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like "Immortal Rites" and "Pleasure to Kill."  Leave the metal to the metalheads you mallcore f@ggot.

Anyway, "Dysfunction is better than Staind's other stuff, but only by a microscopic margin.  Aaron Lewis is a weak, talentless crybaby whose bandmates couldn't make a good song to save their lives.  Every song on here is full of bogus "pain" and "depression" coupled with abyssmal musicianship just like every other nu-metal band.

If you want heavy music that's accessible for the masses, go for Rage Against the Machine (except for "Evil Empire"), Faith No More, Helmet, Living Colour, and Quicksand.
