As if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough. A F***'IN GREASE VIDEO???!!!! Ja officially became a diva with this album. This album is horrible. The pledge had some life due to Nas appearance, thats why it's hard for me to request a zero star rating. Bottomline if Ja's body was made up of his albums, this part would gangrene, maggots would avoid this and you should too
