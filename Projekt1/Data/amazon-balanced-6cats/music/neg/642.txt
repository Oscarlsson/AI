I was literally horrified when I first put this album in my cd player.  This cd is absolutly terrible, every song sounds like its been composed for some middle school band to play.  Furthermore the songs hardly sound like the songs they represent, they'll go through like one riff from the origional then just do their own thing. Do not, i repeat, do not purchase this album. I was expecting some cool, fun, funky lounge music but this cd is just obnoxious. The only thing that makes this cd remotley worth purchasing is the cool album art and free coaster
