This is What you want (1983) was a terrible album from John Lydon and Martin Atkins.  After an rift between Keith Levene and John Lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks, Atkins and Lydon ran Keith off and he quit the band.  Instead of keeping him on the finished tracks, Atkins and Lydon removed Levene and Pete Jones (the band's studio bassist) from the audio tracks and re-recorded them
with members from their Holiday Inn band (Lydon hired members from a covers band who performed at a New Jersey Holiday Inn).  

The new tracks and horrible.  All of the guitar riffs and rhythm
section that were originally recorded for the future album were erased.  Noise and other unwelcomed sounds were added to the tracks.  The original tracks were far superior (even in their basic state) to what was released.  To hear them you'll have to find the Commercial Zone LP.  The failure of this disc and the bickering between Atkins and Lydon would cause the band to become a solo project for the former anarchy king.
