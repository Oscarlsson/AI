The only reason I picked up this album was the name Norah Jones.  I was expecting to hear her at the forefront, and I didn't really.  To be honest, I was hoping to hear more of what she sounded like in Come Away With Me and Feels Like Home.  If you're looking for Norah Jones, this isn't really the album you're looking for
