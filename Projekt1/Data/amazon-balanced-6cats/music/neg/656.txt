Don't waste your money.  This album is cheesy, sounds like a million other pop rock songs, and is nothing compared to their earlier work.  With Donnie Van Zant and Max Carl on vocals, all I have to say is:  they need the old  lead singer back!  The guitar work is ok, but the classic .38 Special sound  has definitely been lost
