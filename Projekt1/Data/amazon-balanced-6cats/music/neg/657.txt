This album sounds to much like Pop music than hardcore Reggaeton. They even have that RBD boyband in this piece. A few years ago LT saved Reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even Grandmas like and that is scary. The only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel & de la ghetto songs. If you wanna hear some real Reggaeton look for producers like DJ Memo, Meka, Mambo Kings, DJ Wassie & DJ Fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin Reggaeton Calle my friend
