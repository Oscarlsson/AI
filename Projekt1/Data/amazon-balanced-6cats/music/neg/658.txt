Like so many new-age artists, Ryan Farish has a great ear for melodies. Unlike most new-age artists, Ryan Farish has rhythmic problems. He likes to use the delay effect on his piano, but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing (sometimes it's one problem and sometimes it's both). I don't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album. Also, the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly
