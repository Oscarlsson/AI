Um. I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre. 

I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?

If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song. 

Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer.
