This tribute was announced almost ten years ago, and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then.  To be fair, there are some interesting additions such as the Sufjan Stevens and Brad Mehldau tracks.  And Emmylou Harris is brilliant.  But Sarah McLachlan's "Blue" has been heard before as has Prince's "A Case of You."  Earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like Steely Dan and Lindsey Buckingham.  I sure would like to have heard what they would have done.  Even more disappointing is that Joni's Hejira-Mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music, in my opinion.  As a final indignity, it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase, and hence the overall sound quality of the CD is lacking in dynamics.
