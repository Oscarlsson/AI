Being an Osmond fan can be very frustrating at times...  This CD has nothing new to offer.  There have been several Osmond compilation CDs in the past 10 years.  What's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover?  Nothing.  I agree with the reviewer who wishes the Osmonds would put some of their old albums on CD instead of putting out hit compilation CDs all the time.  Been there.  Done that.  Bored to tears
