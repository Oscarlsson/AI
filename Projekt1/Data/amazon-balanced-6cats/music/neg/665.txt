As a huge Counting Crows fan, I thought it was kinda cool when I came across a tribute album to them...right up until the time that I listened to the cd. It is nearly impossible to get through. The best way I can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke. I rated it one star because there's no "0 star" option. If you have any intentions of buying this cd, find a website where you can preview it first, and thank me later
