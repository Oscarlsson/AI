I am a hater, to the core. I hate Puffy and thats all it is to it. Now there, you don't have to say it.So on to the review.
First off every lyrical line Puffy spit in this album was outdone by everybody. Every track he had the weakest flow and the worst rhymes. And thats the truth. I don't know how true this is, but I heard Loon was behind most of Puffy's lines on this album. So that should explain the utter wackness in his lyrics. The truth is I don't care who writes his lines. It could be Tupac and Nas doin it, since its not them spittin it, then it actually takes away from the rhymes itself. Almost this entire album is filler. The best tracks is Real N**** and journey through my life. I really didn't feel that beat a whole lot but Nas and Beanie's verses was off the hook. However that is not enough for me to give this album more than one star. Now I love MC Lyte and Public Enemy, but they should get smacked in the back of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their classics. Thats not musical artistry, thats butcher work. Fake Thug dedication really gets under my skin. The title alone. No disrespect to Biggie as an artist cause I do like him still. But they put a diss on Tupac on Life after Death after he died, then denied it for years. So perhaps the fake thug dedication should be to him, cause thats some sucker s***. I didn't hear his latest album, I'm not going to review it, I didn't even visit that section. If you a fan of this guy, then you gon cop this and his new one regardless. If you like me and hate just about everything he puts out, you won't be caught within a mile of that s***
