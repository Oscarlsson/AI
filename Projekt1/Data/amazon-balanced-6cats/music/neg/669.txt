I bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of George Orwell's book came out, simply because it was attached to the movie.  I'll try not to use any non-family words here, but this soundtrack sucks.  Muldowney's original score is available on CD, and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie.  As far as this soundtrack goes, though; skip it
