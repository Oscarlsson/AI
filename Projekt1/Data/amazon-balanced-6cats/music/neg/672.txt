I do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars.   His voice is so mediocre that I am suprised he manages to sell many cd's at all.   I wouldn't waste my hard earned cash on this guy.  Stick with Sinatra and get the best.  If not, and you want someone who can sing Sinatra style, then I would recommend you listen to the young Canadian, Michael Buble. In my opinion Michael Buble is a much better singer that Tyrell.  He can swing and do justice to that genre of music
