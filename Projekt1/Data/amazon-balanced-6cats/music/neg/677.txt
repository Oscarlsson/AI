I said I was going to be honest in all reviews, and yes, I kinda clunkered on this one.  I hate this CD.  Simply put.  They can't sing, and the songs are boring.

I'm sorry I bought this CD, and other people might not like me saying that, but it's my opinion.  I listen to power metal extensively and there is MUCH better stuff out there like Symphony X, Nightwish or Sonata Artica.

Don't buy this, though, you might like it.  I'd definitely listen to it first
