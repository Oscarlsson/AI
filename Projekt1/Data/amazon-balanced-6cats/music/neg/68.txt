Based on other reviews here and comparisons to Jellyfish, Jason Falkner and the Beatles, I was expecting a lot better.  Instead I find this work very shrill and hard to listen to.  Is the guy talented musically?  Yes.  But his voice is mediocre and his songs really don't do it for me.  Sorry but I feel the need to give an honest assessment so others won't be mislead by the breathless reviews here.  I am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre
