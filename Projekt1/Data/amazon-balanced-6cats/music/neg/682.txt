Look, as music goes, variations on a theme is part of any genre. This album, however, yells out &quot;leave well enough alone.&quot; A remix of Sgt.Peppers LHCB might thrill a person born in 1986, but when you hear the real thing, you ask why change it? This album is a total waste of a truly great disc. Like Gipeto said to Pinocchio, &quot;stay wood!&quot
