David Bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial.  This is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial.  A disco-esque record, it's remembered more fondly than it was received by Bowie fans at the time.  It has some good moments, but overall the production is just too slick and there's a dearth of imagination on it - China Girl is an old Iggy Pop song, Cat People is just a newer version of a previous single and Criminal World is a cover of a song by Metro, meaning there's a grand total of five new songs on it.

China Girl proves a perfect foil for Bowie's melodramatic vocals, Cat People is still great even when smothered in too much production and Modern Love proves that you're (nearly) always gonna get at least one classic on a Bowie album.

Ironically, while it made him a global megastar, this record also marked the start of Bowie's alarmingly swift fall from grace.  If he'd stuck to the highly original work he'd churned out before this, he'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway... and nobody could have accused him of selling out.  Now, what's that they say about hindsight
