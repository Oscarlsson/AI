I sorta of agree with the person below, This album sucks....plain and simple, however I think he is still doing a great job in Rhapsody.  I gave it one star not so much because it is garbage, but becuase I was looking forward to this album since "Prophets of the Last Eclipse"  Which was great, but trully...I don't know went wrong.  I don't have a problem with female vocalists, but in this album...it is retched.  I don't think I will ever listen to this album ever again.  Sorry!  But its true...do not buy this album, pretend you never knew he had a new album...OH!  and do NOT buy Luca Turilli's Dreamquest either!  Another bomb
