I could not wait to get this album.  I usually love to hear the new the Hypnotize Minds albums.  However after so many years groups do make mistakes.  This is a major one.  Chrome could suck his name off of a trailer hitch.  I own the original copies of every Prophet/Hypnotize relese since Mystic Styles, and this is by far the worst to emerge.  They never release a Lord Infamous solo album in 12 years (not to mention he is DJ Paul's brother...wait I just did) and now this???  What's next, a Crunchy Black album lol??  THIS IS A PERSONAL NOTE TO DJ PAUL AND JUICY J...PLEASE SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND RE-HIRE (at least) T-ROCK, GANGSTA BOO, MC MACK, AND BRIBE SOME JUDGES TO GET LORD INFAMOUS OUT OF JAIL!!! 

P.S.-  This only gets 2 stars for the production value.
