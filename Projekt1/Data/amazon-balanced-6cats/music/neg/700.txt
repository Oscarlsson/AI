This album is so boring in most places.  I don't know where Keith Sweat's head was at.  It doesn't keep your attention on the second half.  Keep it Comin' was okay, but the other songs Keith produced as well as Joe Public were lousy. He was smart to include There You Go from New Jack City, but the songs before and after it are so bland, It seemed like the formula that worked for Keith Sweat's first two albums didn't work here. I fell to sleep while hearing the album's second half--how can anyone create such dull songs on here?  Sweat's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs.  If he had wanted to, he would have given these songs to Usher instead of singing them himself--they'd be better under him(Usher).  But I warn you, don't get this album--it's going to let you down
