Inspiring? No! Pleasant? No! Entertaining? No! Worthwhile? No!

What are you folks sniffing out there anyway? Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other than the single authentic and melodic track by Patsy Cline (i.e., Back In Baby's Arms, which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own), this CD doesn't have an ounce of redeeming musical, lyrical or social value in my view. Nada! Zip!

Even the Dylan track is junk! The entire CD is essentially drivel, put to the dull, homicide-provoking sound of endless, droning noise, with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one (1.0)!!! What a WASTE of an A-to-D converter
