Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim.  That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while.  But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible.  It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego.  With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this &quot;stuff&quot; had come from the same artist that produced Praise You.  Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.  Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market.  If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales.  So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming.  The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired
