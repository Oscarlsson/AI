After discovering and loving the sound of Gotan Project I was shopping around for groups with a similar sound.  I stumbled along Emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd, I thought I had found another gem.  Boy was I wrong.  The first track drew me in and left me spellbound, unfortunately, it was all downhill after that.  I was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on.  The rest of the songs were so uninspiring, the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise
