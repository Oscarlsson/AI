There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy.
