I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello and ran to the shop as soon as I read the great reviews of this album, what a mistake!!! 

Very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version. The cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'Clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful Ska sound of 'Watching the Detectives' is lost in a jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody.

Elvis' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'Almost Blue' and most of the songs. It worked well on his 'Juliet Letters' album because the Brodsky Quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the Metropole Orkest it is just painful.

For me,'Hora Decubitus' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble
