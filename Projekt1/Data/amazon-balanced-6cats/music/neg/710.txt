I have followed Bruce Hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert DVDs.  I was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other, but if you have been to  Hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here.  I loved the DVD of some of his performances.  There are treasures here, Imagine, solo on the Piano at an awards show, the Star Spangled Banner at the World Series with Marsalis, and his performance with BB King.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan
