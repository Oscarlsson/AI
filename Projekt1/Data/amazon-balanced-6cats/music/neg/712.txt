I honestly feel that Tesla reached the end here. After "Psychotic Supper" failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart. With this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of Kurt Cobain, and here was Tesla trying to make up it's mind what way to go. With the opening track "The Gate" it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80's, but then the next song "Solution" they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90's. The rest of the songs just followed suit. The groups slogan is "No Machines", but there's also another slogan at foot here, and that's "No Music Direction", and for some bands that's possibly a workable concept as long as there's an inkling of where the bands roots are. With Tesla it's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song "Signs", which is a rock song, to where they do a cover here of Joe South's "Games People Play". I feel that Tesla failed to show thier influences here, and was just trying to make a living; which is not a bad thing, but it pretty much kept them at a cult status. I pretty much had this album, but didn't listen to it at the time as I was trying to leave the secular music scene behind, and just move onto Christianity, and I know the album lurked around in my head all this time, so I felt it was time to face it; I feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs, and to me it seems they wanted out of the label, and possibly away from each other.
