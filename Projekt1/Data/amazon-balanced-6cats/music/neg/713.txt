Oh my goodness Rodger, oh my goodness.  Just oh my gosh, I'm just stunned.  This is the crappiest pice of crap that was ever ingested and mushed into chyme.  Yeah, you heard me, this is chyme.  Ok, let's see, let's mix bland country ballads with all kinds of awkward pop/country crossovers.... what do we get, half-baked, half-digested stuff that is for dumb teenage girls who are massively overweight.  Well, they're probably smarter than me........... I'm like as smart as a fungi.  No One Needs To Know and Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under are on the right direction out of the smelly stool sample.  Before I get too many people wanting to massively torture me with horrible utensils I'll say something nice.  Come On Over was an EXCELLENT effort, with all kinds of hooks, great production (errr, I mean it is Robert "I'm actually dead" Lang), and all kinds of fun.  Up! was even better (I'm not going to praise it too much, though, I mean, I AM an 18 year old guy...... so I already feel like I should be staring at a picture of Kevin Sorbo or something... which is not cool, I mean unless it's just hero worship, I could worship Kevin Sorbo)!  But still, we have this horrible, stinking, steaming mass of smelly wet clay-like pudding to shovel into the toilet (it's INTENDED target)...... looks like someone has bad aim
