Being a fan of Jack Johnson, I thought this one would be as good as the others.  I wasn't impressed at all.  It sounds like a few guys pickin' around in the basement.  The recording quality has very little production value.  At best, these are okay live versions of usually great songs.  This is an unnecessary piece for your Jack Johnson collection.
