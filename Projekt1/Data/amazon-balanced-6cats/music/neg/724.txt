I'm a "compleat" Beatlemaniac, and I don't mind the political statements at all, but this is a nearly unlistenable record that I have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album.  I would have loved it if it had been a 7" single, "Woman is the Nigger of the World," with the rest of it just words written in liner notes.  After that opening track, the remainder is a serious chore to get through.  It's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent "Imagine" (1971) and the solid "Mind Games" (1973), but then again, John was not consistent, in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star.  Love John for the genius he was, his commitment to peace, and the great music he made -- it's just that there's barely any of it on this particular record.
