Knuff respect to Public Enemy, they are one of the few groups in Hip-Hop history who've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics.  With that said, this single blows.  It's trash.  The beats are trash, Chuck D and Flavor Flav don't rap, the DVD is just them hanging out in some clubs.  It's a shame, legends such as Public Enemy are far above this remedial single.  If you want to hear their best worx, go and buy Fear of a Black Planet, or It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  You won't be dissapointed..
