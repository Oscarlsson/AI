With the exception of "My heart will go on" by Celine Dion, Horner's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers.  

For a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film.  Overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it.  This was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic, awful event.  

It didn't stop them though; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water.  Overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year
