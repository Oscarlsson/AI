We read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper. We (my husband, three kids 14, 10, and 5) tried it on a warm, spring evening in the car. One or two songs, like the Banana Splits, Speed Racer, and Scooby-Doo were fun. Most however, were harsh, and too fast for the parents and youngest guy.
I would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers
