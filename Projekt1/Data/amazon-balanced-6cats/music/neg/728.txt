This record kind of sucks, but that's okay, because it doesn't suck in the way where you think &quot;oh hell we'll never get a good album out of this guy again&quot; (like, for instance, Rod Stewart's latest garbage), because, I think, it's not really Lou's fault. The problem is Lou's trying to draw his material from somewhere else, in this case a mediocre poet. We've always been willing to overlook his (Poe's) considerable lack of talent (example:  &quot;in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore&quot;) because he's so damn charismatic. Morbidly charismatic, but charismatic nonetheless. The danger is that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art (which I guess makes him a lot like the Rolling Stones). Lou, who's always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink, has now chosen an artist who is basically Bernie Taupin with a better vocabulary to be his kindred spirit, and from someone who, Velvet genius notwithstanding, produced revolutionary and stunning works like Transformer, Metal Machine Music, and Berlin, this self-effacing friendship is the real tragedy
