I bought this cd for one song, &quot;Walk Away&quot; which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
