So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version.
