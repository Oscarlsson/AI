this is NOT,i repeat NOT five stars!in all honesty it's more like 1.5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug & atmosphere.albums like overcast,godlovesugly,the felt project,and the dynospectrum album is much better than this.though the lyrics are thought provoking,but slug has been better,the production doesn't hold up.it's some of the weakest i've heard from rhymesayers.there's only a couple tracks that stand out,but i'd have to say "don't ever f**king question that" is the best.if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album.slug spits classic verse after classic verse
