Do you LOVE "On Eagles Wings"? If the answer is yes, then do you know the words to Panis Angelicus? The answer is probably "no." I don't blame you for liking this CD. The problem is that it isn't Catholic and it isn't Classic. You should ask yourself if you are willing to entertain the songs that Catholics have enjoyed for thousands of years. If you are willing to look beyond the guitars at your local mass, start with Sacred Songs by Bocelli, or Simply Baroque by Yo Yo Ma
