I have been listening to military band music for years, and am rarely disappointed.  However, this compendium of music by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste.  Many of the arrangements are strange, and there is much too much vocal music when what I want to hear is the bands play.  I would not have bought this album hhad I known beforehand what I know now
