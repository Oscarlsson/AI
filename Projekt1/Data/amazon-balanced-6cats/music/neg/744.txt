I like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while I'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax.  This CD just didn't fit.  There are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast/upbeat or there's too much talking/chanting.  I found myself distracted when I put this CD on
