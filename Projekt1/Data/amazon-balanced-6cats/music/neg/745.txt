Certainly this album offers very little to a fan of The Ocean Blue's eariler work.  The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound).  And what about those awesome saxaphone and  keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun?  Just because Steve  Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether.  So,  anyway, what does this album offer instead?  Harder sounding guitar,  angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are  lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after  you've had the CD for a couple weeks.  Exceptions: &quot;Whenever You're  Around&quot;, and &quot;Slide&quot; are good enough songs to standout  inspite of boring production
