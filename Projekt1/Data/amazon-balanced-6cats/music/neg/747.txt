Hmm...  Ok, maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this CD, but I heard one of the songs on it, Hashkiveynu, performed (partially) during an episode of the West Wing, and it sounded AMAZING (it was NOT the same cantor as on this CD).  I am not Jewish and not even very spiritual, but I wanted to have that song in my collection.
I immediately searched the web for the info, got the name of the chant and found this CD.  I almost purchased it without listening, when I found a different site, where they actually have rather long excerpts (2 min.) of most tracks, so I listened to them.  
Boy, was I relieved and disappointed at once!  Relieved that I didn't buy the CD and disappointed that I couldn't get the song I wanted (I was willing to buy a whole CD for just 1 song, that's how much it impressed me).
The song sounds very little like the one from the West Wing, although I do believe that the site where I found the info speficially pointed to this CD as having a recording of the same song used in the show.  And I'm sorry to say it but the voice also doesn't hold a candle to the one used on the show - way too "operatic", as mentioned by many, and harsh and even unpleasant-sounding to me.  It took all the charm and candor right out of the song (in the show, they had a much more natural voice do the song).  I also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist.
If anyone knows where and if I can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer (if it can be the one from the West Wing, I'll be thrilled), please, let me know.  In the meantime, I'm passing on this CD..
