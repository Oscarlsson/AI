I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series
