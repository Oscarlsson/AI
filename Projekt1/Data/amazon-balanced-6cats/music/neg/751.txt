Lou Reed rocks!!! Dude!! But methinks this collection dost not. The tunes are all good, but there aren't very many of them, and the sound is deplorable, in that inimitable RCA-first-CD-edition sort of way (fans of the Jefferson Airplane and Harry Nilsson know what I'm talking about). A much better jumping off point would be &quot;Different Times: Lou Reed in the 70's&quot;, or, even better, check out &quot;Transformer&quot; or &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Animal&quot;
