There are some artists who have been active since the 60's and 70's and who are still producing vibrant, excellent music. Paul Simon, say, or Bob Dylan. Kate Bush, though she started a little later. All of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great. 

Joni Mitchell should have stopped when she was ahead. Maybe I don't rate as a JM fan because I've only heard Blue, but I've listened to that album hundreds of  times times over the years.  

I wanted to find out what she was up to since then, and bought this album. All I have to say is, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I was EXPECTING her to change and grow, but not into some pale ghost of the 60's droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism. The lyrics are old and tired, and the instrumentation is hackneyed and stale, too. The only good lyrics on this album were provided by Yates. 

At least her paintings are good.
