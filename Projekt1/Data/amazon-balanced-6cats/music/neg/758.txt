This disc was simply a waste of my time...very mediocre songs, heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent...Corey's voice is below average....I get the feeling that Corey Clark is IMITATING a good singer with a VIABLE career, and not doing it very well....clearly 'fake it till you make it' isn't working here.  The songs all sound the same, I kept waiting for something to get me grooving, but it just didn't happen.  

I think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential...he either needs voice lessons, a little humility, and some professional grooming (and I don't mean clothing).
