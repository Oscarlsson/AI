now, if we're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts, but maybe just because people are lowering their standards. Besides, the fact that I dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges, this CD is no "Dangerously in Love". Where Beyonce's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album, Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me.
Aside from the obvious car banger  "I Just Want It to Be Over" and the wildly popular "Love"(which Cole butchers when singing live by the way),nothing here surprises me.  Like I said , you can call me a hater, but with women like Beyonce and Fantasia around Cole's fire will probably be put out soon
