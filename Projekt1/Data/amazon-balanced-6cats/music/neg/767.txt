Well, ok, Mehldau's arrangements aren't bad...He does a great version of "Paranoid Android" but otherwise...WHERE'S THE ENERGY?   There's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album, and I do understand this as being a more laid back, mellowed-out album...but it is still possible to be more exciting, energetic, or emotional in this style.   All three of these things are pretty much absent from this CD which ends up making it dull.   :yawn
