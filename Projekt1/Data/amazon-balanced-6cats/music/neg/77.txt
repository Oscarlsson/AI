I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality. 
What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger. 
There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like "Swim": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire." Or the artistic suicide of the last track, "X-Girlfriend", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long. 
That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between "Machinehead" and "Glycerine." The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building.
