These guys are not artists. They are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene. It's like a few monkeys build a house, and all the other monkeys rave about it, but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat... whatever that means.

I am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio. Buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere.
