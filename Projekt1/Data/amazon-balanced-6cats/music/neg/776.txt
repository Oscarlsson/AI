I don't even own this CD, and after seeing the reviews I don't want it.  90% of the "5 star" reviews are people with ONLY ONE review.  Suspicious?? Look for yourself, it's right there to see.  I have some other meditation CDs that are very repetitive, I'm not going to make the same mistake here, especially with such SHAMELESS self-promotion
