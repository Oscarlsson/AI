Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying "look people, I got money, arent I cool" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating.
