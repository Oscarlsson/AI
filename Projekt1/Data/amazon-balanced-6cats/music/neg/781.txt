Golijov's music incorporates Jewish, Arabic, Christian, Afro-Brazilian, and other ethnic influences ad nauseum...

So what?

Listening to this disc is like having dental work done without novocaine.

Only DIVERSITY NAZIS who want to smugly bask in their own "enlightened" weltanschauung will find much to enjoy here.

Golijov cunningly caters to these folks' taste. May he ride it all the way to the bank.
