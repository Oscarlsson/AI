For those who were fortunate enough to aquire one of the first two releases of the THIEF soundtrack (like myself) congratulations - you have the version of the CD that contains the best song on the soundtrack, Beach SCENE. It has been dropped for this US release.

For those who were interested in obtaining the Thief soundtrack being mainly interested in the one song, Beach SCENE (most of the other songs can be found on other Tangerine Dream albums), please realise the following differences between Beach THEME and the now dropped, Beach SCENE.

The song, Beach THEME is a much shorter track (almost by half) and there is a very cheesy, acoustic, "rock n' roll", drum beat that was mixed/dubbed over the original Beach SCENE song which has the much more mellow and less invasive electronic, sequenced drum beat in it. It's Beach SCENE that was both heard in the movie and over the airwaves back in 1981. If that is the song you remember (fell in love with) and are looking for, do NOT buy this latest release. Keep looking for those Out Of Print CDs - they are out there.

On a lighter "note", it's very nice to see they added the ending/end-credits song, CONFRONTATION.

This is a lose/win scenario for THIEF soundtrack fans - it all depends on which song is more important to you. If you already have the earlier releases with Beach SCENE on it then buying this latest version  will now complete a defninitve soundtrack for them as that last song in the movie has now finally been added to the official soundtrack
