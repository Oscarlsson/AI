To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song
