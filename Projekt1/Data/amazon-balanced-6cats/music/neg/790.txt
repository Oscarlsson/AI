If you work in a comic book store, live in your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.
