Informatively, I have Mason's DVD's, which I quite enjoy.
However, this CD, labelled, "BRAND NEW," contains many  repeats and 
situations. In fact, at times I was ahead of Jackie Mason, mouthing word for word the joke and situation he was leading up to me.

Mason spoke as if he was rushing to meet a deadline, to the extent that much of the CD sounded like gibberish.  For most of this CD I sat stone faced and suspected that perhaps the applause and clapping of hands were canned.

Mason, in my opinion, went overboard in his use of obscenities, 
loudly and in his asides,seemingly contrived for shock value.

As for me, I think that this mislabelled, "BRAND NEW," CD was a
flop, and I would not care to have it in my collection for fear
of the impression I would leave after my demise.

So, another item destined for my shredder.

Finally, I would recommend the Mason DVD's, which I would have preferred with a slower delivery and less obscenities that add
little to his performance.
