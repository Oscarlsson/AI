Once again, the geniuses at Universal have failed to give fans a decent collection! Although the single disc Very Best Of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of Robert Palmer's career, it omitted a few "must have" songs in favour of live material (making for a 90% OK collection). Earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from "redo" syndrome: the artist redoing a vocal track here, a drum mix there, re-recording entire songs elsewhere. This collection's no different. In fact, there are many "remixed" and "redone" and "alternate vocal" mixes present (something the Very Best Of album avoided altogether, much to its credit). Here, insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing. Indeed, the classic and sequenced "Sailing Shoes/Hey Julia/Sneaking Sally Through The Alley" trilogy that marked the beginning of Palmer's breakthrough album is present, but the songs have been scattered apart from one another. Thereby pondering the question: What were they thinking? Why was this done in this manner? What do fans really want? A 2 disc set that features the original material (remastered, yes, but not remixed in any way, shape or form) and a proper chronological sequence. Done in this manner, such a set would properly honour one of popdom's most memorable and talented individuals. What Gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia, took the right batch of songs, but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner. This collection does no one any favours. Stick to Very Best Of until another bright light at Universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection. That said, the way the music biz is these days, don't count on it.
