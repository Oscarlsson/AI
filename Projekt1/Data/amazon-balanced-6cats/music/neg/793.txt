I bought Guerolito after hearing "Heaven Hammer," the remixed version of Guero's "Missing."  That remix, by Air, is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of "Missing" and makes it feel at home in a louder, more tempting sonic landscape.  That song became astonishing where the Guero song was simply alright, and the new song, "Clap Hands," is at least a good time.  However, it's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of Guerolito - the beat and the original of, say, "Earthquake Weather," (here as "Terromoto Tempo") are both individually appealing enough, but together sound dismayingly like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other.  "E-Pro" becomes a groaning mess, the lovely "Farewell Ride" an electronic nightmare, and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole
