I loved "Come Away With Me" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better!
So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album "Feels Like Home" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since.
She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat.
But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better
