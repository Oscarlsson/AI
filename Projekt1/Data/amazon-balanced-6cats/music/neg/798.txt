This CD should have been called "The Most Annoyingly Overplayed Songs of the 1990's." With the exception of "Shine," every single track on this CD is juvenile, mindless, fluff that was overplayed on the radio in the radio until you were ready to scream! If you're looking for a CD that represents the greatest music of the 1990's, check out Non Stop 90's Rock or Forever 90's instead. 
However, you might be interested in this CD if you want to host a cheesy 90's dance party. The songs are kind of fun and catchy if you listen to them in moderation
