Mercifully, VH-1 hasn't released the nauseating, moron-targeting 'I Love The 90s' DVD series (yet), so you'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion soundtrack disc.

This is precisely the kind of CD which shouldn't even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the internet, legal or illegal.  There's no rhyme or reason to the collection, and the songs you might actually want to remember...you probably already downloaded them.

The source show is easily one of the most appalling projects MTV/VH-1 has produced in some time.  It's basically a bunch of 'comedians' and third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s (or rather, the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996, say) with such fond memories and gusto, hoping the next generation ingests this poison with the understanding that Mambo No. 5 was a 'good, memorable song' for instance.

Avoid at all costs.  Take pleasure in denying Tag Team their royalties when you find their 'classic' song on online...for free
