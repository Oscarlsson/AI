There are 2 really good songs on here.  The first is "Untitled," which sounds like Gibbard was listening to a lot of Brian Wilson at the time he wrote it.  The percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds.  "Underwater" is a pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is "Send Packing."  It really is a beautiful, well-written song.  The rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments.  Basically, the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly.  All in all, I wouldn't spend 10 bucks on it, but a couple tracks are pretty good
