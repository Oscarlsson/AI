I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.

Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.  It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy.  "Tant pis, vers le bonheur.
