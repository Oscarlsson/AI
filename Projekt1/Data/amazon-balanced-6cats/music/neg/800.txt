This CD shocked me. At first I was listening and enjoying the beats on every track. But then listening to the actual content of each song, B*tch this and h*e that. Come on, as a young female, how am I supposed to bump this in my car? Every single song on the CD is disrespectful. You know what really makes me mad, this is what's supposed to be hot, popular. What kind of message is this sending to our young black men? Our young women? I would not recommend this for any one, especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman.
