The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the "mixing DJs" for the great vocalists:there  is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart "Do ya think i am sexy" single cd instead
