My two parakeets seem to enjoy this CD a bit, but if you want a CD for relaxing listening, be prepared to be irritated.  I tried to go to sleep listening to it one night.  I had to turn it off because it just got on my nerves.....I kept thinking it was stuck....like a record stuck in a grrove.  It sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the &quot;repeat&quot; button on a couple of bird sounds.  I think I could have done that.  I'm just glad it didn't cost a lot, but now I can see why.  Sorry for such a bad review, but I just had to tell anyone planning on buying it.  I now just play it for my birds when I am NOT in the room
