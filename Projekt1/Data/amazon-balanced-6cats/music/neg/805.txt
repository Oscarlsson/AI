Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality
