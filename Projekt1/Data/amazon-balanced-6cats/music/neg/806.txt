Some of the songs here are good, most notably "Never Be Forgotten".....beautiful.  I heard this song on the radio and I thought it was Faith Hill or Martina McBride singing.  Herein lies the problem.  The song is good, the voice is good.  But if she sounds like Faith or Martina, there's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there.  Add to this that this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country....there's really nothing that stands out here.  Why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there?  That's the question.
