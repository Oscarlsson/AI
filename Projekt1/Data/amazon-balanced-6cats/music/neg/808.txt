If the name Pink Floyd wasn't on this cd, who would really rate it higher that one or two stars ?  I am a Pink Floyd fan, but I have to say that I don't like any of their early works.  To me, the band begins to make great stuff with "Meddle" and their first cd were boring, even with the Pink Floyd name on it. The only good track is "Childhood's end", the other tracks are poor
