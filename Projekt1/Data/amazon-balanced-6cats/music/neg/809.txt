Eight years ago today was the day Blondie's reunion album was released, and though it was great to see Blondie back together, No Exit just fell short on many levels. 2004's The Curse of Blondie(see my review also on Amazon)is a much better album and should have been their comeback. No Exit won't exactly take you back to the hooks that made Blondie famous. Harry's lyrics are wonderful in "Double Take," but the deadpan melody literally kills the song. Fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards("Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room") or revamped demo tracks("Out in the Streets"), but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by Coolio. Both the band and Coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about. The music isn't catchy either. All is not lost with songs like "Night Wind Sent," and Harry's own transformation in "Forgive and Forget, plus who would dare argue Blondie's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear "Maria." As the album's best track, "Maria" is a wonderful reminder of how Blondie, and Debbie, can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind
