I saw the movie and liked the songs in it.  I ordered the soundtrack from the movie, but it was not the soundtrack.  They have a dubbed another person in on Ike's part.  All the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of Tina's were included.  I feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack.  I was disappointed.
