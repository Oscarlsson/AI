There is not much I can add to these reviews here. Just like me, a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2Pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters. Why would such an abomination happen? Suge Knight is trying to milk the Pac legacy until it is bone dry. Well at least he has done something right if you ask me. It sucks that this is how we are forced to remember Tupac Shakur, over tracks chopped up into this. Die hard Pac fans won't even like this, if they haven't heard it already. I'm so waiting for a remix album of "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle".

If Suge Knight was smart you would reissue Tha Dogg Pound's "Dogg Food" on dual disc, because that is the only reason why I don't have that album yet.
