While well produced, I was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings.  Frankie Laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same.

I bought the CD to replace a well worn vinyl album, but on listening to the CD I found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very), different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album I've loved for over 30 years!  High Noon in particular is quite different, much slower, with vocal emphasis changed.  I'll probably listen to the CD from time to time, but not with the same relish that I enjoyed my old LP
