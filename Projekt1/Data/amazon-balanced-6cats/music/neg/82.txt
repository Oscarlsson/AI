Chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world, he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy.  Along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop, and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true).  Jackpot went multi platinum, which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat.  In fact the beats aren't all that bad, if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as I would not have to listen to his irritating voice.  If you heard Right Thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like I did), you are wrong, Chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats.  His lyrics are absolute garbage, what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production, and some top lyricists have to work with nothing.

Compared to this album, his follow up Powerballin bombed and with any luck it will be the last we ever hear from this loser.  Find him working at a McDonalds near you soon!!
