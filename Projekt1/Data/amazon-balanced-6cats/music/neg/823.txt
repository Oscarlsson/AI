The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE
