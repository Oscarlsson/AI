I picked this up because a) it's Boz Scaggs, a guy whose records I wore out when they first hit, and b) it's full of great old songs.  BUT:  Boz sounds like he's doing something else, maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window, when he sings.  Hard to imagine that the man who punched out "Lido" can sound so half-asleep performing great material.  A washed-out, almost depressing performance.  There are many much better renditions of these classic songs.  I imagine it's hard to come up with new material, but please, if you're going to do these songs at least sing as if you're awake.  No emotion, no involvement.  And to add annoyance to injury, Boz somehow found the world's worst drummer for this session.  If you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him, incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive.  Pass on this one
