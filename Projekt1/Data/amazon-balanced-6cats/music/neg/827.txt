It's a decent album but she seems to copy riffs a bit on this album. Mother Mother definitly rips of Stairway To Heaven from Stairway's ending vocals riff. (and as we wind on down the road..) Does she give Zep credit on that? Now that Rockstar Supernova has used the song twice it has brought Mother, Mother back to life a bit but that riff rip just annoys me. Good female yell and complain song but I just can't get past that riff rip
