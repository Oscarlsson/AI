I can't, for the life of me, understand the appeal, or better, the necessity for the Black Crowes. To call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they don't possess...There's nothing here that hasn't been done better, with more creativity and feeling, and of course, originality, by the Stones, Faces, et al...And it's not a valid counter-argument that the Stones stole  from the great blues masters, because, of course, they did...but what they also did is add some value, something of their own, that was completely fresh...What these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on..
