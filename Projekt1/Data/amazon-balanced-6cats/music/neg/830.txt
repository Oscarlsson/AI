I was deeply disappointed by the so-called &quot;return of the funk&quot; with the Headhunters reuniting with their original lineup. As compared to Herbie Hancock's original &quot;Headhunters&quot; release, the Return of  the Headhunters is missing one main ingredient, the grease. This recent  release has traded the &quot;grits and gravy&quot; created by the sounds of  overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers, for over-produced  smooth jazz-funk, complete with overused N'Dea Davenport R&amp;B hooks that  left this album flat
