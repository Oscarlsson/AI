usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for &quot;legend&quot;)but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too&quot;forced&quot; for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the  main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(.
