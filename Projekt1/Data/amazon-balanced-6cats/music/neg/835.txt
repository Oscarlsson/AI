this cd is pretty awful,you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd, one of the worst songs ever is Calling,, it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground, na na na na , na na na na, i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer........
