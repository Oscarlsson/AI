All in all, I was really dissapointed; I really enjoyed the King Geedorah album.  I thought the King Geedorah album boasted  stellar, thematic, production, tolerable skits, and street-wise but deep lyrical content.

Doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'Escape...'  All have the stereotypical Doom sound, with the only standout being '1,2...1,2.'  The X-ray produced tracks are minimal, but generally sound stiff, lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines, few sampled melodies.  I did like 'Warning (Kong),' which has a nice, minimal, dark groove.  

The lyrical flows have a classic New York sound, pretty good.  Lyrical content is pretty bad, unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d$&*.
