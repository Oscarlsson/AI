I purchased this CD shortly after finding out that Nickel Creek would be disolving their union as a band.  I hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself (as a strong supporter of Nickel Creek) and my two children.  This CD honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music that Nickel Creek produced over the past 7 years.  Although, I guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this CD.  You have to keep in mind that the members of Nickel Creek were just children themselves when they released this CD.  I don't believe that they had found their true musical identity, and they obviously wouldn't have reached their full musical potential yet.  This CD isn't really the best for a todler either, so I have to say that this purchase was a let down overall
