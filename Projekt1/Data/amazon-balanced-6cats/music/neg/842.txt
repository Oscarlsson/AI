I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead
