I had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50's and 60's Jazz Legends - before they became household names.  It was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again.  I heard brief notes from this CD and I must agree that Mr. Winston did attempt to capture 
Mr. Guaraldi's timeless expressions, but the this production did not have the same "golden flow" as the original.
