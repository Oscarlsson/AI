Look, I dig stand up, and I dig fat jokes, but this guy isn't that great.

I got a friend who loves John Pinette, but I can't see it.

He tells jokes about how fat he is, how he likes to eat, how he doesn't like to move.  Its the same over and over and over again.  Its dull and it's too easy.  They're not even jokes, really, just comments on how fat he is.

Also a fair part of his act consists of "asian people talk with accents and thats funny" which I find cheap.  Stereotypes shouldn't be jokes, and even when they are, they shouldn't be THE joke.  John says something with broken english and the audience laughs really hard.  Why?  Why is that funny, here in the 20th century?

Maybe I just don't "get" his humor, but I don't think this guy is any good.  I perfer comedians who tell jokes.

On the plus side, this guy is clean, which is rare these days.  But there are better clean comedians around.   Try getting a Brian Regan album or an Emo Philips album.  Jerry Seinfelds album is good too.  Try those guys because they're clean and legitimately funny
