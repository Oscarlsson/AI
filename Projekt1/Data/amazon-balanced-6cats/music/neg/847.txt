I have all her other cds I especially love Unsung Heroes there is a vibe to that cd that gets u right in but with this one its like shes just tryin far toooo hard to be good....Sure the technique is spot on but THERE IS NO SOUL the emotion is missing...for me I like my jazz vocals with feeling. I like the singer to take u on a journey deep into to the song. u wont get that here all u will get is technique..
