I have both Volume I & II so couldn't resist buying Volume III.  The music was good, can't complain about good pickin' like that but I did notice that the original intent of the album is being re-thought it appears and it takes away from the entire concept for me.

Will The Circle Be Unbroken II was originally made to showcase the talents of the decendents and family of the original players/singers on Vol I.  It was keeping the "circle" alive by bringing in fresh new sounds from new generations of musicians of those who played on volume I.

TOM PETTY??  Where does that come in to play?  How does he fit in the circle?  I was amazed that "this ones son" and "that ones son" were invited to play on this album, but the Huskey's (whom I loved for their bass playing) were totally ignored this go 'round.

Junior Huskey played Vol. I, Roy Huskey Jr. (Junior's son) played Vol. II.  Why wasn't Roy's son John invited to play on Vol III?  Isn't that the purpose of this album? To keep the circle alive?  Roy Huskey Jr has 2 sons, one of which is a musician (not sure about the other one).  Where was he?  Given the tradition of the albums, I don't see how Tom Petty could possibly be invited over a 3rd generation family musician.  I was very disappointed to find the Huskey's not on this album.  They were the backbone of the first two.

Not just the Huskey's, but there are other noticeable's left out of this album as well.  It's just a shame that such a great concept has gone down the tubes.

It seems to me, that in favor of the elite, the circle has most definitely been broken which really takes away from what the album was intended for
