The fact that this has had no US release was an immediate warning .... however as a longtime fan I figured I would check it out.  Boy is this bad.  There are a few decent tracks, however the truly awful "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "This Magic Moment", "Only You" - among many others - make this unlistenable.  Miss Ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the Billie Holliday material.  She is a producer's singer: Ashford and Simpson, CHIC, Holland Dozier Holland - even Hall & Oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics.  This is a mess.  Diana, your voice still sounds great - STOP executive producing your projects
