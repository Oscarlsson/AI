I used to like good charlotte, enough that i bought this CD, but i really don't like them at all anymore.  They try to look all punk, but they are pop.  They whine a lot.  I think it's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool.  they should at least stop doing songs about it.  They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny
