Like the Backstreet Boys (essentially the same band), and Brittany Spears (their female solo artist - and I use the term loosely- equivalent), NSYNC represented all that went wrong with the music world in the '90's. Sure, there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages, but at least groups like The Eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments. Not NSYNC, who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who couldn't write a decent tune to save their lives - I bet even their voices were digitally altered. 
And then there were the inescapable hits - Bye Bye Bye, Pop, It's Gonna Be Me, Tearin' Up My Heart, et al., that weren't even good the FIRST time around, to say nothing of the nine trillionth. No risks taken. No attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made this group of no-talents famous. Basically, this band was thrown together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six guys who wanted to be famous (and probably had never previously met), sent them through the assembly line, removed any sense of individuallity or creativity they might've had, and dumped them upon the masses, who they must've brainwashed or something. I didn't even like this group when I was 10, to say nothing of now. Makes you wish Zappa was still alive - he'd have a field day with a group like this, and undoubtedly dish out some of the funniest insults ever in the process.
