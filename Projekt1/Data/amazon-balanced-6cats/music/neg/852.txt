Best of Dark Horse is another half-hearted attempt to gather George Harrison's greatest songs together. This time we only get tracks from 1976 to 1989. 

While there are some good songs (Blow Away, Crackerbox Palace, Cheer Down, etc.) the rest don't represent his best songs from this period. Where's Faster, This Is Love, Someplace Else, etc?

The only reasons to purchase this CD are for the rarities Poor Little Girl, Cockamamie Business and Cheer Down.

Until they make a true Best Of, we'll have to make our own single-disc compilation. Here are the tracks needed: Apple Scruffs, My Sweet Lord, All Things Must Pass, What Is Life, Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth), Living In The Material World, Crackerbox Palace, Blow Away, All Those Years Ago, Dream Away, Cloud 9, This Is Love, Someplace Else, Got My Mind Set On You, End Of The Line, Handle With Care, Cheer Down, Devil's Been Busy, Any Road, Rising Sun.
