Chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again. FFTMC and BTS were lush and beautiful productions. NIcks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he's doing these days...no, we're not saying recycle the older productions, but instead it's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey, it doesn't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes, how the mighty have fallen...
oh brother..
