No one questions Lyrics Born's talent, which can be matched by few. His breakneck delivery will make you swear they sped him up in the studio, except then if you go see him do it live (recommended: he is a charismatic performer) you realize they didn't.

The problem with this release is not, therefore, Lyrics Born himself. It's just that there's not enough interesting things happening around him. There are handful of standout songs on this record, but there is no excuse for it running as many tracks as it does. The skits remind me why I sometimes think the whole idea of skits on CDs tired itself out in about 1997, if not earlier. Worse, the fillers sound similar to the hits but less memorable, making the whole album kind of drag, and the grooves, guitar licks and keys, all of which are good in small doses, become sort of flat after a time, especially when Joyo Velarde isn't singing backup vox. Surely a few of the songs could have become B-sides on the single, or something, instead of bloating the album itself.

Do That There, Rise and Shine, and One Session are my favorite tracks, the ones I would say go buy from the iTunes store or something right now. There's nothing wrong with the rest, I just don't find myself listening to them much. I like the concept of Later That Day but it should probably take less time out of the day to listen to
