This product is listed as "Limited Edition Special Packaging" at a cost of $30.99.  It's nothing but an ordinary CD in a plastic jewel case with a "Made In Hong Kong" sticker on the back.  It's the import version.  There's nothing "special" about the packaging.  Save your money and get the domestic version for $14.

The album itself is awesome by the way.  Nick Cave continues to make fantastic albums.  Even though I feel ripped-off by Amazon's inaccurate advertising I must say this album is totally worth having.  This is raw and noisy.  It's removed from the introspective albums that Nick Cave has produced with the Bad Seeds recently but is better conceived than any Birthday Party record ever was.  It's not The Bad Seeds. It's not The Birthday Party.  It's GRINDERMAN!

To be fair, I asked Amazon to refund the price difference between this misleading product and the domestic version, the difference being about $17..  They agreed and I got my refund in no time.  Thanks Amazon, great customer service
