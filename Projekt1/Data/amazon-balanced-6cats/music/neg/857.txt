It is ludicrous to even mention the fact that The Duprees have lasted so  long and can still be seen in Atlantic City considering the fact that there  is not one original member of the Duprees in the group that is seen in  Atlantic City. This is a major problem with many groups purporting to be  from the 50's and 60's. The Duprees appearing today is a perfect example of  caveat emptor ... buyer beware for those readers who don't read Latin! For  those of us who were Duprees fans, this is a not to be missed CD of the  original Duprees with the incomparable sound of Joey Vann and harmony that  is hard to match. They did Joni James proud in their remake of a number of  her hits. It is nostalgia personified hearing the original Duprees
