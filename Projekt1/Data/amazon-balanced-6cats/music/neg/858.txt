Diana Krall's popularity is not hard to understand, she's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice - rich, round, and polished.  But that's where the good news ends.  The selection of material and the narcoleptic Bossa-Nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a CD that is nothing less than a love song to Darvon, in fact, inside industry sources maintain that the entire CD was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man.

The rule with standards is, don't do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair.  Ms. Krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly; cruel and unusual punishment considering it's a wonder they're still standing.  The resuscitation of Popsicle Toes is both the final insult and injury, for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity; how could she do this to us?  Wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who aren't listening to each other, much less the ambient audio wallpaper, there will be a demand for music of this type.  The Diana Kralls of the world can always find work because for many - smooth equals good.  Walk, don't Krall.  Beyond this woozy, soft-focused world there is music that is real, and really matters.
