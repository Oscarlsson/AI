I was prepared to spend the original $26.05 list price for this motion picture soundtrack. At that price it was already the most expensive out of 12 CDs ordered. I was refunded the money to "The Last Starfighter" due to an error listing. When I went to re-order, the new price is $49.95. What a joke! Someone is pocketing an incredibly high profit margin. I would love to have focussed my comments on the actual composition, but until it is sold at a fair price, I will reserve my rating
