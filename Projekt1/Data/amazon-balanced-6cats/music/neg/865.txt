Like the other reviewer of this cd, I am also a fan of Buffalo Tom. Unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to BT, in fact it is a bit dull.  None of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair, since I only played it 3 times, hoping it would grow on me.  I'd recommend "Up Here" instead of this one, it's much more listener friendly
