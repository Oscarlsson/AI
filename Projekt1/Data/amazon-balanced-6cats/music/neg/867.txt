man i don't know what he was thinking when he recorded some of these songs.  the musicianship is, of course, outstanding and his voice is perfect for covering lightning hopkins, furry lewis, son house (shaker lp) but who wants to hear repeated renditions of my old dog blue? i agree with other reviewers who laud "james alley blues" "richland woman" the 2 l.hopkins songs "katie mae" and "darling, do you remember me" muddy waters' "little geneva" and sonny boy williamson's " don't start me to talking." the other songs do not merit a second listening for anything other than historical interest.  the "shaker" cd is even worse.  son house's "death letter" is above average, maybe even great.  the rest is barely listenable.  if you love the blues, particularly folk blues you will be infinitely happier with any l. hopkins cd
