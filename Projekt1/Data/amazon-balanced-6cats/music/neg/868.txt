Stinkish-I totally agree with you 100%!!!! What was mattel thinking when they released this item? Some songs are ok, but "Hit me baby one more time?" That song is soooo old! And so yesterday, by lip singer, Hilary Duff, is sooooo yesterday!!!! You gotta be desperate for music to actually buy this or want it.If you think that i am way wrong then include me in your review
