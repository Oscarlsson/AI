Although a few of the tracks seem inspired, it's mainly Mulligan going through the motions with Getz, with very little chemistry between them.  &quot;Anything Goes&quot; and &quot;Scrapple From the Apple&quot; are nice  enough but beyond that it's weak.  Mulligan himself didn't speak very  highly of the recording session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates  with Desmond, Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that &quot;Granz wanted  that session a lot more than I did.&quot;  Of course, it would be quite out  of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about Stan Getz and  his sparkling personality.   Save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue  of &quot;Meets Ben Webster&quot;.  Or, if you don't have it already, the  seminal Pacific recordings with Chet Baker
