There used to be a time when rap was not synonymous with the likes of Hillary Duff. No longer is that true, if you call this rap. Puff wasn't that good to begin with, and I never owned any of his cds but I knew of him...anyway, by the time I heard he changed his name to PDiddy, I about laughed until I pissed myself.
