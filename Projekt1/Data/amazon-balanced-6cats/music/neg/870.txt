I purchased "Empty" not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable, but eventually forgettable, pop/rock.  This sophomore effort is, simply put, amatuer and sub-par.  Some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as "Empty" B-sides, while the cover of "Electric Avenue" never really distracts most listeners from thinking "What is this and why?"  Over all, this might appeal to most Christian radio listeners, but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is: mold-fitting white noise
