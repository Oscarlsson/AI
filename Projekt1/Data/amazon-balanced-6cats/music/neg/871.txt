Having been a fan of Joan Osborne's take of "Son of a Preacher Man" on her original indie record and "Heat Wave" from the recent 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown' soundtrack, I was looking forward to hearing this record of covers.  I was ultimately disappointed.

First of all, I have to say, there are two real gems on here that really needed to be updated, one for its amazing vocal/instrumental sound (The Spinners' "I'll Be There") and the other for its message (Timmy Thomas' "Why Can't We Live Together").

To be sure, there are some great tunes on here that I am always up for listening to, such as Stevie Wonder's "Love's In Need of Love Today" and Undisputed Truth's "Smiling Faces Somtimes", but Osborne adds little to these.  When she does change things around, the effect is questionable.  I know that Norah Jones has brought back the torch song style, but Osborne's bluesy take on Edwin Starr's "War" is seriously misguided.  The same is true when you rip the melody and add bland vocals to classics like Aretha Franklin's "Think" or The Band's "The Weight" - especially since the former could have really used some punch from such a powerful singer like Osborne.

Overall, this was a missed opportunity.  I hope her upcoming 2005 record is a reinvention
