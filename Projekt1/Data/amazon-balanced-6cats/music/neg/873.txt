Ryuichi Sakamoto's credibility is on the precipice with Chasm, a turgid unlistenable work of crud. Check out Coro and Only Love Can Conquer Hate, both sound like factory machinery at work. Dire, dreadful and diabolical. Stop being the artiste Ryuichi and have a go at entertaining. Your fans deserve better
