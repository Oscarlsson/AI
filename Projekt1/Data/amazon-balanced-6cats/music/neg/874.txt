La Grange is probably at the top of most ZZ Top fans lists, and rightly so as it is superb, but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track, which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording.  It is so awful that I don't know how anybody can listen to it.  Thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for Rancho Texicano.  Clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here, dummies.

Also, Waitin' on the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here
