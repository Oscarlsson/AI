I own all of Bebo Norman's CDs, and I LOVE all of them, except for this one.  I bought it and listened to it once, and I hated it.  It does not sound like Bebo.  This sounds like Steven Curtis Chapman or Michael W. Smith or any of the other mass produced Christian/pop music artists.  On all of his previous albums, even though he changed his sound slightly, it was still generally very acoustic and Bebo-ish.  This album sounds nothing like his previous music.  I was disappointed.
