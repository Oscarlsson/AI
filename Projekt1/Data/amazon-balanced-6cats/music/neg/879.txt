This young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice, albeit a little underpowered, but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture. There is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties. In fact, I suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short-shorts. Once again, sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art
