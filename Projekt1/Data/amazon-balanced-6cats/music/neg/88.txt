This soundtrack was `heart-brokenly' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film.  I bought this soundtrack for one specific song (and it would've been worth every penny if only it was included): the song near the end when Alexander marches through the desert to return home to Babylon after his recovery.  Such a disappointment that wasn't included.  

In the other hand, I'm satisfied with some of the tracks that were included.  I particularly liked "Roxane's Veil" even though I don't recall hearing it in the film.
