I really don't want to be mean, but I find this album very shallow.  Classical Indian music is a very complex, subtle and beautiful thing.  Comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience, but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy "world music" cliches.  I don't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting.  And this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything, I have delved deep into the avante guard, minimalism, "new music", eastern and western music theory, microtonal, etc. I would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing.  However if your mainstay is jungle/drum&bass, then this would be a step up for you, so go for it, it is worth the pruchase in that case
