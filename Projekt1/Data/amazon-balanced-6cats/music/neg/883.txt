this album had two good songs at the most. ralph was good with new edition. it's apparently obvious that he can't stand alone. bobby should have been the lead for new edition. then we may never have seen this terrible album. ralph isn't that good of a singer. this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group doesn't mean you are the best. ralph is miles behind bobby
