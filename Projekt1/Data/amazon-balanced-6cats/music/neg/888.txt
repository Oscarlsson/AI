First show on Broadway I ever left at intermission. I bought the tickets because I didn't think I could go wrong seeing a show directed by Strohman, starring Craig Bierko who was fantastic in Music Man and was flat flat flat in this show, and music by Harry Connick Jr. whom I have loved forever. It taught me that everything has it's place and Harry's place is not a Broadway stage. I hope for his sake, he does not try again. If I could rate something at zero stars, this would get that rating
