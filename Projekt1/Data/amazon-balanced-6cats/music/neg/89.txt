This album made me realize that darn record company produces, for examle, two regular albums; two best albums; two tribute albums; and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums  from a musician. This is an example of the mixture of previously released,  re-released, at last, over-released best tracks with a sounds-like-regular  album title.  Let me tell you one thing. JP is dead and gone since Rob left  the band. I doubt there will be more regular JP albums but you'll have  plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying
