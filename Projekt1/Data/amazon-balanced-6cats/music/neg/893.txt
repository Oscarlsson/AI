It seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them, and the Flower Kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds.  Here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom, strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment.  Though not as crass and offensive as Stolt's "Wall Street Voodoo" or Bodin's "I AM", this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness.  There are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release, but not enough to justify its purchase.

Stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that "...peace & love never go out of fashion..."  Well, neither does informed maturity, and you won't find any of that in this group's recent output.  Just more utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting.

Their liner notes advocate sending money to Greenpeace and Amnesty International, but I would counter that any American would be better investing their extra cash at St. Jude's Children's Hospital.  I'm going to sell my copy of "Paradox Hotel", and probably several more Flower Kings cds, to do just that.

There are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would-be hippies
