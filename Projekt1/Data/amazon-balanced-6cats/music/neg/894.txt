I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70's, and although the Nelson Riddle stage and the Mexican stage were not my style, I still loved her vocal perfection.  This is truly the only album I haven't played more than twice (I didn't like it the first time, which surprised me, so I tried it again). It doesn't showcase her voice or her talents. The songs are very ho hum.  Linda, put out a Christmas album (been waiting for years), and try to get sweetness back for this old fan
