AFI used to be a pretty good band. Then, they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. The lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. What happened to smeely-goth-dude? Some of us actually like the music, not the "emoness". Not only that, but "Miss Murder" was waaaaay overplayed, and now it is encrested into my brain. I mean, come on, it's not even that good of a song.

AFI is looking to appeal to the mainstream. There's nothing wrong with that, if you keep your old sound, which this band has failed to do. This, my friends, is AFI's worst album, if not hte worst album of 2006.

Check out the older AFI stuff. "Sing The Sorrow" is okay, but if you want truley good music, you have to go back into their ninties albums
