   There is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name Dr. Seuss.

    The Fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about, wake up people!) and James Horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that Seussian sound. 'Where are you Christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and I mean both versions. And whose bright idea was it to have Jim Carrey mangle 'You're a Mean One'?


   If you're looking for a more Grinch like score, go find Elfman's Nightmare Before Christmas
