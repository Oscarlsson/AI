I bought this album on the strength of positive reviews and personal charts displayed on amazon.com and amazon.co.uk. These suggested that Eloy's Silent Cries and Mighty Echoes album was redolent of Pink Floyd and Yes. Actually it is, but only both bands at their very worst. The album opens with an inept attempt at Gilmouresque doodlings circa 1973, moves on to some truly rank singing, with the singer's phrasing hardly assisted by a strong German accent and thus the suspicion that he doesn't understand the absurdity of the lyrics. Actually, at times the lyrics do remind one of Jon Anderson at his silliest, although we forgave Mr Anderson and Yes because they were superb musicians and songwriters. With Silent Cries & Mighty Echoes the tunes are pooor and for progressive rock, the song structures are of almost childlike simplicity. That this album was made in the late seventies is extraordinary in itself. It would have been appalling in 1972. To discover it was recorded in December 1978 is gob-smacking. Unforgiveable tosh
