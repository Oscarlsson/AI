I knew this wouldn't be the Sia from Zero 7's album. Little did I know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents Zero 7 have behind the mixing boards. The song production is terrible. I couldn't find one song I really liked on this CD. Sia truly has a unique voice but it's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight. Still, I'm severely disappointed, particularly because I had to pay for this CD as an import
