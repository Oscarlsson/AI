i deeply love the music of joni mitchell. it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you, to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it (as i stupidly did). the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it (a new mature joni! a return to the roots! a brilliant acoustic album! and nonsense like these...) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see (well, hear) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years (except "dog eat dog" which is superb, but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it's an '80s disaster). it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening. ok, some lyrics are quite good, but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s. so, i really do not get the point: it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say (how painful it is to face reality!), so, why should all of you praise her? just because of what she did in the past? ok, let us say that she WAS the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation (according to me, much better than bob dylan) and let us praise her forever because of that; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does, even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art. i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album (and anything else from 1982 up to now - except, as i said, "dog eat dog"). if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell, try anything you want from the 60s and 70s. really, anything. try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins. you have to be prepared, for it could be beautifully dangerous: once you know her, you will never let her go away from your soul
