At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd.

At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.

To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.  

If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.  

I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, "If the South Woulda Won," which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song.
