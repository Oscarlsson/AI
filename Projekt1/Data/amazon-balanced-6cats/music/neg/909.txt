This Album Is not what I call a album First 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats.  Best track on here is &quot;I practice Looking Hard&quot; probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career I love that song but otha than that &quot;Captain save a hoe&quot; and &quot;Mail Man&quot; are a discrace. He shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track
