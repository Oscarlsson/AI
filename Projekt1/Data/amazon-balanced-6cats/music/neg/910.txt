I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better
