I bought Kayslays Pain From the Game about a week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule;).  I read that it featured production by Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Eminem and the Heatmakerz.  And as far as rappers go, most of the Shady/Aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists (fat joe, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Scarface, Memphis Bleek and Prodigy, etc).  So I expected this cd to be a big step up from the Streetsweeper Volume 1 mixtape (which I would give 3 stars at best).  But for all the talent on this cd there's not many good songs.  I thought the production was pretty weak.  Some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west, swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland.  If you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made, grab this disc.  If your looking for good music leave this one alone
