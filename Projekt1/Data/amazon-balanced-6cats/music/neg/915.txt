As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time.  Ultra Chill series 1-4 was outstanding.  While Ultra Chill 05 is not a complete disaster, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating.  Quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs.  Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.  There is a lot of Jazz and Latin chill on these two discs, which I also like, but the Jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great.

I think the person that rated this 5 stars doesn't own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please.  I'm very dissapointed.  Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh well...
I'm off to listen to "Chillout Seesions 8"... Hopefully it will be a lot better.  I highly reccomend Chillout seesions by Ministry of Sound.  Chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding... Time to go listen to the new 8!
