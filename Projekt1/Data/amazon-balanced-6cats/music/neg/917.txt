There is at times, a fine line between noise and music. NIN not only crossed that line in this cd, but stomped on it a few times in the process. Not even close to the calibre of WITH TEETH, this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians. 

Songs that go from semi-music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide, while "playing" the same thing over and over and ...well, you get my drift. 

If great music is your thing, pass this one up. Or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination
