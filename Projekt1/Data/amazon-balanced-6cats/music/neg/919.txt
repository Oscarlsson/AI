Almost 10 years later... and I am still waiting for the punchline.  I think this is the most properly named album of all time... as the easiest summation is:  it lacks ANY punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes!  Its terrible, especially when contrasted with Pornograffitti.  Gone are the great guitar tone, riffing, rhythm, power, and groove that marked most of the prior three albums.  It's what the forth side to "III Sides To Every Story" could have been... "Yours, Mine, The Truth, and THE SUCK".  The songs are lackluster, but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album.  "No Respect", surprisingly, by name, is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album.  "Waiting for the Punchline" still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time... I dont write negative reviews unless a CD is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work.  In this case, it fits both... its bad for Extreme... and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well.  Conversely, in my opinion, III Sides and Pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums, respectively
