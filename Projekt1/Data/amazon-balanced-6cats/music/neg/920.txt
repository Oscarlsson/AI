As others have noted, this was a time of turmoil for the group. Now trimmed back to a fourpiece (they had just lost guitarist/singer Bob Weston and singer Dave Walker), they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with Martin Birch on. This CD also leans really heavily on material from Bob Welch (this would be his last release with the band) and it suffers deeply for that.

Most of the few highlights here are furnished by Christine McVie. The title cut is a nice lament about male prevarication. The understated "Prove Your Love" is also a winner. Of the Welch contributions, the only real standouts are the mystical "Bermuda Triangle" and gentle closer "Safe Harbour".

There are plenty of miscues, filler, and outright bad material here. McVie's "Come a Little Bit Closer" is produced like it WANTS to be a hit, but it's much too slight to stick in the memory. Welch's "She's Changing Me" sounds like Chicago colliding with the Mac...the horns don't work here. The handclap bridge in "Silver Heels" seems too poppy and out of place in the context of the rest of the tune, which is execrable anyway.
 
The silver lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell turned into the band's finest hour just one album later..
