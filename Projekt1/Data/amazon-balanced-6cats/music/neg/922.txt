After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker.  It's coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make.  I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly.
 
What else is here?  Oh, you have the "Karate Kid II" ballad "Glory of Love", a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon, and go straight from the original "Karate Kid" to "III" and "Next" whenever I do my yearly film marathon.  I just pretend the second film never existed.  It also has the semi-smash "Next Time I Fall", where Traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy Grant.
 
In short, if you a) thought Cetera's leaving Chicago was a great decision, or b) like your music pointless and nauseating, by all means get this album.  If you want music with real heart and soul, just go buy some Chicago.  You'll be glad you did
