I cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star.  Luckily I got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour.  I love classic Journey, but this band has gone downhill faster than I ever thought possible.  Most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics.  'Arrival' was pretty mediocre, but this is about 5 steps DOWN from there.  Granted, Steve Augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great, but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting.  The only way this band will ever create quality new music is if Perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band.  Otherwise, the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years
