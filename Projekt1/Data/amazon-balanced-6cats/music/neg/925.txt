Method: Take a monster, genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago, borrow the voicings, polyrhythms and sound effects, rearrange them to slightly (but not *that*) different tunes, crib the album art (cheesy then; cheesier now) and re-release.

The point? Well, to The Man, it's obvious. There's one born every minute. But for genuine, discerning afficionados of electronica? Search me. Like a good souffle, it was better the first time.

Indeed, inventing Oxygene Parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch. And guess what turned out to be Jarre's next project? 

Whoops! Writer's block, perchance?
