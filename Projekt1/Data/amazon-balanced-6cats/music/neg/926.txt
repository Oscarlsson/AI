I never write reviews for anything, but this one was so bad, I couldn't help myself. Everybody has different tastes, but if you like music with any kind of structure or melody at all, you will not like Belladonna. I could not make sense of it at all, it rambled on and on, never getting to the point, never picking a path, never building on a theme. It bored me with it's vague attempts to build a song. I listened to it 2 times just to make sure I wasn't imagining how bad it was, and then I dumped it. It was not my style, and I don't see how it could be anybody's style, but that's just me. I felt obligated to voice my opinion and possible save somebody out there from being bitterly disappointed. Good Luck on your listing adventures
