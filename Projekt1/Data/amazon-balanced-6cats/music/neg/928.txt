I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it
