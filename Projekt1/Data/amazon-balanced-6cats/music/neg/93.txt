I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn...
