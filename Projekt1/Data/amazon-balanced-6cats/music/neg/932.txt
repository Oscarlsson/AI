This will be the third time I have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album, and I suppose I have been too harsh, because neither of my previous efforts have been posted. Lets keep this one simple. This is not music, plain and simple. I purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site, and was terribly disappointed. It basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence, structure, or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument. Call it performance art, experimental noise, whatever. It's simply not music.
