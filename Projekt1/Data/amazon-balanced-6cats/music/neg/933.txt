Dan Fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer. Unfortunately, the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts, songs that seem formulaic and &quot;safe.&quot; His best songs are the lesser known works -- listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them. They'll never make it to the pop airwaves. Serious Fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd. &quot;Greatest hits&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;greatest music.&quot
