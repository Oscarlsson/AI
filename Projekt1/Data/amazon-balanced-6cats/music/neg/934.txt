I love the song &quot;NASCA LINES&quot; which I first heard on a Putamayo world music CD, so I ordered &quot;UNDER ONE SKY&quot; since it has &quot;Nasca Lines.&quot; I figured all the music would be as good, but I was so disappointed. It was very jazzy, which I hate. I'm going back to the Putamayo CDs
