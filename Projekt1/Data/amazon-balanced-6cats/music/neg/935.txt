I am very dissapointed with this DualDisc, because there is no comment (worning) about DVD region protection. What can I do with this disc - region 1, in Europe (region 2)? My message for Sony Corporation is: "This format will not exist for long with DVD region protection! Sorry.".
My first, and last DualDisc. Back to the SACD
