Once "The Very Best of 10cc" was released in 1997, it was the collection to have.  That collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc's career, ending with the Godley and Creme hit "Cry."  So why would this CD be released, especially since the only thing it offers over the prior CD is "Channel Swimmer" and "Don't Hang Up?"  Buy the CD "How Dare You" and "The Very Best of 10cc" and you will have three times the music you have on this CD for only twice the price.  An unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio
