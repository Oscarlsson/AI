This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's &quot;Stronger Than Death&quot; album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of &quot;All For You&quot; and &quot;13 Years Of Grief&quot; sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of &quot;No More Tears&quot; tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. &quot;Like A Bird&quot; is the best song Neil Young never wrote and &quot;Blood In The Well&quot; shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story
