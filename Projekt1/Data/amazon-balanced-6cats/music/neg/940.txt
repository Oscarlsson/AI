I bought this CD for "Hole In The Earth", a very dynamic, driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker, and mostly got what I expected - more of the same along a continuum, sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction, as I expected. 

And then I came upon "Pink Cellphone", a rotten apple if there ever was one. This vile little stinker is as if one of the band's groupies wandered into the control room in a methamphetamine haze, defecated on the mixing board, and then described her experience, in no uncertain terms, into an answering machine. If there was ever a reason to switch from buying an artist's complete CDs to just purchasing individual tracks off of the web, this is it. Congratulations, guys, you have not only lodged a very descriptive and literally filthy image into my head, but convinced me, and I'd wager, many listeners, that our faith is ill placed with the musical choices that pop musicians make when assembling their "B" sides. To say nothing of the bad taste and lack of respect for your audience that this demonstrates. 

Someone should wash the Deftones' mouths out with a bar of soap - maybe a few bars.
