Awful. I mean, really awful...and I liked "Self Portrait" because you knew Dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image. This album is just a disaster. The lyrics are OK on most songs (I've seen worse by Dylan), but the music is unexciting, not very creative, and downright embarrassing on some tracks. Why, oh, why did you have to make an album like this, Bob? Such talented people at your disposal for these sessions, and you threw it away on garbage arrangements. Shameful. Really sad.
