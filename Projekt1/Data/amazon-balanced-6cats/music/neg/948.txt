When will artist realize you can't change the old classics.  The only successfull R&B group to sing the classic "Night and day" to their own beat was the Temptations CD "What women want" the best rendition I have ever heard.  Smokey does have the voice for these kinds of songs.  Another good CD with classics is Willie Nelson's Stardust
