Ignore the unique cover, clever song idea( there is 30) which
represent a comic book. Ignore all that. It simply is not good.
What is this? I dont even know how to describe this music.
It's not even songs, but more a bunch of really short experimental, non-sensequel, inerworkings of annoyance. They
will start off with a riff as if they are going on to a song,
but its only a tease, until they stop and go slow, to say," get
on with it!!!!!!!!" Add a bunch of zany sound effects, not to
mention the recurring anoyance of a high pitched voice ringing
out, sci-fi clips and completly hoarse vocals that are screams,
and sounds,that add up,to one of the most pointless albums ever put out
