Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money
