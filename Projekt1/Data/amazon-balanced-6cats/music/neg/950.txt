I had high hopes for this cd. I love norwegian metal, and I love viking stuff so I thought this would be great. I was at least hoping it would be good. What I heard was a bunch of uninspired, mediocre, a dime a dozen metal songs. I mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste, but not enough to give it even 3 stars. The high points are The fate of Norns, The persuit of Vikings, and Arson. These songs are bad @$$ and fun to listen too.
An Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm 5.5 just mediocre
Where Death Seems To Dwell 5.5 very repetitive
The Fate Of Norns 7 This one is pretty good. It has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it.
The Pursuit Of Vikings 7.5 This is my favorite song from this cd. Pretty Bad A$$.
Valkyries Ride 5.5 Tedious Monotony
The Beheading Of A King 5.5 Same as Valkryies
Arson 7.5 A bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitar
Once Sealed In Blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still a downer.
All in all nothing horrible, and there is some good songs. The music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad. I like a lot of simpler music like Darkthrone and Burzum. The problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff I like it to have some really good aptmosphere. That is precisly what is lacking here. I will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow.
