I am a huge fan of Thomas Newman but really this CD presents nothing new. It comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy, atmospheric, melody-free cues from his other recent scores. It has none of the originality of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Frankly, as much as I like his scores, I don't think this warranted a CD release, it's just got too bland and ordinary, no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds. A pity
