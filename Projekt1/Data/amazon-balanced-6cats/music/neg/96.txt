I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will admitt this is not a good album. The worst being "Home" which uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to. Most notably is "Clevland is the City" which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any "harmony" to it. Other songs worth mentioning are "What About Us", "Not my baby" and "Pump,Pump",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released
