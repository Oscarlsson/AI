  I like Machine Head a lot.  Many people disliked "The Burning Red" and called them sell-outs, but I appreciated the effort to make something different.  Then came "Supercharger".  I have listened to it a dozen times, looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it.  It never came.  This is a bad CD by a great band.
