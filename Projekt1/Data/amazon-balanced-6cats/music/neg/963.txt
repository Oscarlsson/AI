I love Milton Nascimento's early work (&quot;Travessia&quot; and  &quot;Clube Da Esquina&quot;), but this does not reach that level by far.  My main objection is that it does not live up to the promise delivered by  the famous names of the participants like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter,  Pat Metheny a.o. &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; is OK, but the rest is just too  pretentious. Just as a warning to all Brazilian music lovers out there:  this is certainly not a must have, apart from die hard Milton fans. I would  rather recommend to check out the latest releases by fellow Brazilian  Caetano Veloso (&quot;Livro&quot; and &quot;Prenda Minha&quot;), because  they are really indispensable
