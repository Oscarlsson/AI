My wife got this CD for me because I like the music from the movie Cast Away.  She saw the words &quot;Cast Away&quot; in large and prominent print.  She saw the picture of Tom Hanks, very large.  She assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on  the CD.  In hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the CD.  I guess the producers of this CD didn't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people wouldn't waste time returning it.  If you had it listed in the rate column, I would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star
