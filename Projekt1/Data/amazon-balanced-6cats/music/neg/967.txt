Great fan of the man they call 'Sugar' Zucchero, but this outing is really below par. This CD consists of rerecordings of older songs, with the addition of other famous singers. Did he send the original recordings to these people, en did they ad little pieces here and there? It sounds like it! None of the songs have gotten' better compared to the originals.

To me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money (and get more attention for 'Sugar' outside of Italy?). Don't buy it, get 'Oro', 'Shake' or 'Blue Sugar' instead
