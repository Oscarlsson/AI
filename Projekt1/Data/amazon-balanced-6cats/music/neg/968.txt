This cd is, without a doubt amazing.  Stars are lost because prior to recording, you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn NOISE GATE for his guitar rig.  His tone is crushing & sounds perfect, but the second he stops playing, every time SSSSQQQQQQUUUUEEEAAAALLLLL.  It's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once, because it is a chronic problem in every song.
