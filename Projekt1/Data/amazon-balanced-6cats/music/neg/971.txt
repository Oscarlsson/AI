When I first saw this album I thought "Heavy D....WITHOUT The Boyz?!  That can't be a good thing."  Here's the problem with this album: Heavy D took the "jiggy" route.  When I heard "Big Daddy" for the first time, I thought it was pretty tight and that it had that Heavy D feel to it.  So after hearing that, I went and copped the disc.  When I got home and read the liner notes, my jaw hit the floor.  There was Heavy D....smoking cigars, iced out, and playing the big willie role (the popular theme for the "jiggy" crowd in '97).  At that point, I realized that original MCs were quickly becoming extinct.  After years of success with his group, Heavy D had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time.  That might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent.  There are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen.  There's a lot of lazy and predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking).  On "I'll Do Anything" Heavy D and Tony Dofat COMPLETELY jacked Hall & Oates for their tune "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" and it only gets worse throughout the album (I won't even get into how the Gap Band's "Yearnin' For Your Love" was abused on "Keep It Comin'").  There aren't enough good songs on this album to make Heavy's change of heart seem very believable.

Avoid this album y'all.  It's not completely terrible, but it comes dangerously close.  There are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack.  Sadly enough, this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album.  I was very disappointed in Heavy D and lost a little respect for him after hearing this.  I can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $3.00.  Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
