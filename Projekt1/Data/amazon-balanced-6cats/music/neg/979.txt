Rhymefest is an Ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping. Man, I thought I was in for a classic hip hop album , It was like the Lakers were
ahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track. I admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ain't hittin I could care less what you're rapping about. Rhymefest used so many R&B singers I thought I was listening to some old New Edition or After 7 joints not that I don't like those singers but I don't want to hear that on no hip hop album. If you want to hear some real Chicago hip hop check out All Natural the best besides Common to ever come from the city of wind
