I love plenty of Contemporary Country music... everything from "New Bluegrass" (Alison Krauss & Union Station) to "New Country" like Reba McEntire, Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, Martina... even a lot of Faith & Shania.

But I think this CD is crap.

The single star is for the only good song on the album, "Heads Carolina, Tails California" -- but really, 1 star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous.  I'm astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are... elementary-school rhyming, uninspired melody lines, stupid lyrics, below-average accompaniment, etc.

One of the most annoying things to me is her habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song... I'd guess someone told her at some point that she slurs her words, and she was trying to overcompensate.  The result should be titled "Hooked on Phonics, starring JoDee Messina."  Listen to the preview of "On a Wing and a Prayer" for a good example of what I'm talking about.

I thank my lucky stars I borrowed this cotton candy from the library, rather than shelling out $16 for one song.  Do yourself a favor and buy "Heads Carolina, Tails California" online if you must have it
