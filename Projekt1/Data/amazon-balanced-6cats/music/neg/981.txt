This is by far the WORST KMFDM RELEASE... No Esch, No Schulz, just Sascha and Skold messin around with a little Pig..   At first listen this album is not bad but once you get used to it, this album is really boring..  Dirty, Skurk, and Preach/Pervert are really the only songs worth listening to.  I was embarrased to listen to "Risen". It was just lyrically horrible I don't know what's wrong with them.  Now in Skold's defense, he is a badass, his voice is cool and he's a good writer his solo album is good.  But we had him in Symbols, Adios, MDFMK, and Attak it was just a bit much. This album is bland at times good and most times pretty bland.  Not what you think when you think KMFDM, though Urban Monkey Warfare is still cool... whatever I am one guy buty it, if you like awesome, if not sorry..
