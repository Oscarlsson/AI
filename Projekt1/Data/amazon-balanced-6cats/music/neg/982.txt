This whole post crap grunge is crap.  If you want real rock check out GNR, ACDC, and any band pre grunge.  I know this is a review but how does this grab ya. Oh and I won't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom. &quot;Oh how did we wind up like this?&quot;  Exactly what I'm trying to figure out.  Tesla's got more talent then all these bands and they can't get any airplay give me a break
