I'm not exactly sure how to classify this, nor do I think it really deserves the time.  How this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me.  My only guess is that some tired, pretentious teen on MySpace raved over it and voila, the clique was born.  

Now, I really wanted to like this and gave it numerous listens.  But each time, it sounds more and more like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house, started humming some melodies and then recorded them.  Immature and pretty much unoriginal.  And just because an album is labeled "concept" doesn't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece.  If you want a flawless concept album that actually has an interesting story just go and buy "The Wall".  Unless your circle of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this, don't bother with this bloat.
