OK - let me preface my comments by justifying the 2-star rating...It's Rodney Dangerfield - he was a class act.  As for the CD:  If you're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone's cheesy clavinova, then this CD is for you.  I bought this because of the last track, "Rappin' Rodney", and boy was I disappointed. It sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette.  Do yourself a favor - get all of Rodney's DVD's with his standup material and remember him for what he was - a comedy legend
