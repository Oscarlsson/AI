I received this 2CD set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called "mastering".  I have original un-mastered copies of some REO Speedwagon albums that sound BETTER than this set!  I love REO to death and the track listing is good to go, but in all honesty, this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality.  The band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for.  I cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close.  Save your money and wait
