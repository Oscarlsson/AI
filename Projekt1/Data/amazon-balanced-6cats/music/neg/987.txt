Hysteria.

**

I see great polarities in the reviews of this record. I fall in the camp that sees this as a overproduced microtargeted superficial pop record designed for radio and MTV. I consider that shrewd writing & marketing. Brilliance is a term I'll reserve for Led Zeppelin.

I tend to like my rock harder, with two arms and less cheesy. Sadly, this record doesn't fit the bill. For that, Pete Willis era Def Leppard suits me much better.

I don't need to give you a song breakdown by breakdown. The important factor here is what you enjoy. If you enjoy superficial 1980s MTV pop or mindblowing heavy rock - that distinction will determine your opinion here. This album is definetly the former.

I'll beg to differ with the Amazon reviewer - it *DOES* sound dated. Its a record thats signifigant for its hype. When listened for its depth. It is symbolic of the later part of the decade which it was released.

Prepare to be transported back to the spandex era on plopping this disc in
