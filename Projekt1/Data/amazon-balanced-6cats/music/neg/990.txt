 There's always the argument that if Bach had had a modern piano, he would have composed for it. Let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to Bach's doorstep, he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque composers.
For listeners who understand what Bach meant by equal temperament, it's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what Bach was trying to demonstrate in these "pedagogical" compositions. In other words, the point is lost.
