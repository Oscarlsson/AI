To much guitar, drowns out all the other instruments.  Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars.  I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you.  No songs on this albums have that sound.  The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember.  Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along.  I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways.  ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor
