When John Cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist Gary Duncan were in the groove, there was no better sounding group than QMS. Cipollina's talent was awe inspiring. Unfortunately, one of Quicksilver's overbearing and domineering members ways led to Cipollina's departure. Without Cipollina, QMS sounded like just another mediocre rock group, despite the talents of Duncan, Freiberg and Elmore. I saw them at the Hollywood Palladium 33 years ago and can verify this.If you want to hear them at their best, buy the 1st album, Happy Trails, or Lost Gold and Silver
