Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is monotonous, predictable.  She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of  really interpreting the song. In addition to this, the arrangements are  unfortunately very poor. Her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra.  Only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with  candles, but this is not the album I would like to listen to again and  again
