Blues singers shouldn't try to go mainstream. If they do try and succeed, fine. That means they've stayed true to their roots. When they try and fail (as Susan has done with Hope and Desire), one would hope they'd try to get back to where they started. For me that was Just Won't Burn. I guess when one is happily married with children, it's hard to sing the blues since you're not feeling them . . . you're faking them
