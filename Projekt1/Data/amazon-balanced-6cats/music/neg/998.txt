Gonzalo is a fantastic pianist.  This CD however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side.  However, it is languid and the tunes don't stand out.  It is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if driving later in the day.  I have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste.  But it is exciting.  Not here.  There is barely a hint of any Cuban influence in this music as well.  Now some will like the gentleness I suppose, but with weak material and not much diversity, it sits pretty flat with me
