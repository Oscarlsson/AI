I didn't think it was possible for the Delays to top their debut release - but they have. While "Faded Seaside Glamour" is more immediately catchy and refined, "You See Colours" comes at you in a much more intense manner. The songs are more mature, the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies. The high points for me are Valentine and Winters Memory Of Summer, but there's honestly not a bad track on this release. The Delays put it all together - great songwriting, strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody. It's a shame these guys don't get more recognition here in the States. Buy it
