If you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on Enigma Records, hang on to that out of print gem!  Straight To Hell is back on CD as Straight to Hell Returns, and may have a lot more tracks this time, but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track.

Not appearing this time are: "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" by The Pogues, and my personal favorite "Money, Guns And Coffee" by Pray For Rain.  The track "The Killers" by Pray For Rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the original, but on this new release was shortened to only 2 minutes.  This is rather perplexing considering Straight To Hell Returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds, which would have left room for those other tracks to be included (since CDs can run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds).  I'm deducting a point from my rating of this CD because the missing tracks should have been included!

On the plus side, this new release contains a lot of short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the original CD release in 1987, as well as some brief dialogue excerpts.  

The film was a misunderstood classic, and the soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful: The Pogues, Joe Strummer, Pray For Rain, Zander Schloss, Elvis Costello's MacManus Gang, and even dialogue excerpts from Courtney Love before she was, well, I guess the word is "famous."  If you're a fan of any of these artists, you'll love this assortment of songs...those not familiar with the film may not be able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals create, so get the film on DVD and you'll appreciate the works of these artists so much more.

The liner notes claim this CD is to be considered the "official" soundtrack, while the first release of it back in 1987 was basically a "souvenir."  I enjoy both releases immensely, but since I was listening to those other deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now, it's sad to not hear them this time around
