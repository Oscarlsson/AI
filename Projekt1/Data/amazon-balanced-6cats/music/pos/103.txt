I'm just starting to become a true fan of Pigpen.  Earlier, I just didn't get him and I would constantly skip forward to more of the GD extended jams.  Lately, I've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows.  I'm glad I picked up this set.  
It's Pigpen's night and we should all be happy for this nice memory.  Pick it up.

Note: the rest of the band has some fine moments too!!
