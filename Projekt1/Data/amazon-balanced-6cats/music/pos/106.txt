I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I was a teenager.  I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his work and this CD is no exception!  He is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous!  His voice is as good as ever!  Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words!
