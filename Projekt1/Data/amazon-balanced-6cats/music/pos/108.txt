I was already a fan of Mike and the Jacksons, But when Motown 25 came on in 83, this guy set the standard for what music and performance could be and where it could go. Till this day in my lifetime that one performance at Motown 25 is the single most perfect performance I've ever seen. I remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other. The saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the Michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves. Hilarious. As an adult, I refuse to let the media and even Michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music.
