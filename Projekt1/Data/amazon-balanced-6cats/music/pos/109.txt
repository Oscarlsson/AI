Review no.77.A superbly/nicely done reissue of The Zombie's second 'actual' album(isn't it?).Total of 27 tracks,so since the first twelve(12)cuts were the original lp,I guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks,wow!That's a lot,for a one-disc release.A fine CD to repeatedly play,plus keep in your 'current rotation' stack for a long time to come.It's PROBABLY just me,but these tunes SHOULD be in a different playing order.That's why I'll sometimes pre-program this CD before I listen to it.Loads of fabulous/memorable tunes to enlighten your evening with here,like "Care Of Cell 44"(three versions,but welcome),"Time Of The Season"(stereo and mono versions),the beautifully-done melodic "A Rose For Emily"(2 versions),"I Want Her,She Wants Me","Maybe After He's Gone" and a cut that I've certainly never heard before,but was quite impressed with it,"Butchers Tale".Obviously,The Zombies must've had hours of unreleased material that most of the world didn't take great notice of,until now.Simply,a must-have.Timeless top rate British Invasion rock&roll that'll never truly die
