Right, so by putting a review down for this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather" wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved. Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it
