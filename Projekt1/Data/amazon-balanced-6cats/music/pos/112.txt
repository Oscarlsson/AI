With his snarling, gritty guitar tones, swampy grooves, and scratchy vocals, C.C. Adcock makes butt-shakin' music that blends rockabilly, old-school Memphis R&B, New Orleans funk, Cajun dancehall tunes, and juke-joint blues. He's young, but no poseur: Having paid dues with Bo Diddley and Buckwheat Zydeco, Adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand. But despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass, this isn't a retro-sounding record. Adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous. Doyle Bramhall joins Adcock on two songs, and together they raise 6-string hell. Boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude, Adcock's music is soulful, somewhat twisted, and deeply satisfying
