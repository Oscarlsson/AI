REM has had a helluva lot of hits, and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands.  This 18-track album does a good job for its length, but I really do feel a 2-CD hit package is warranted.  The biggest omissions are "Shiny Happy People," "It's the End of the World as We Know It," and "This One Goes Out to the One I Love."  It wouldn't surprise me if the band didn't really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection.  However, there are a few other more minor hits I know from them that are missing, like "Radio Free Europe."  I just can't think of other titles right now, but there are more than a few other omissions too.

Many of the minor hits that are included here, thankfully, are very good and will grow well on you: "The Great Beyond," "Bad Day," "All the Way to Reno," "E-bow the Letter," and "Imitation of Life" are songs I haven't heard enough of and I'm glad they are on this collection.  Still, I hear REM is coming out with another compilation and I imagine it will be more complete; I suggest waiting for that album when it comes out
