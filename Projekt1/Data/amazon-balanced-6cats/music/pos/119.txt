I had been hearing "Always Thinking Of YOU."   But, I never got who it was.   I purchased XM radio and on the smooth jazz channel, I heard the cut again and got the artist name.  Purchased the CD based on that one cut.   Every cut is great on this cd.   I look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future.   He has his own style.  But, not only do you hear hints of Benson and Brown..........I hear a little Doc Powell as well.   I will be introducing friends to this great artist............Keep it coming............
