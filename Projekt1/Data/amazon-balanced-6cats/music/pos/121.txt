I heard the first Beat LP (&quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band's brand of ska/soul/rock.  For some strange reason, I never bought &quot;Wha'ppen&quot; and never got familiar with it.  I confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away.  Of course, I did buy &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; and found it to be par excellent.  So I ordered &quot;Wha'ppen&quot; a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and I've been wearing it out.  Damn!  How did I miss this?  This is a great collection of snaky sweet, politically smart songs.  &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot;... I've loved that song for years... and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot; has always been a favorite.  But every other single song on this CD, including the bonus tracks, is outstanding.  These songs are textural wonders.  Great stinging guitar work and the incredible Saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording.  I regret not discovering it sooner, but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact.  Oh yeah... one more thing... I had the pleasure of meeting Dave Wakeling in Nashville this past summer and he's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him.  If he comes to a venue near you, don't miss the show.  You'll get your money's worth and more.  Wear your dancin' shoes.  He is truly one of the great talents of the 80's and continues to make significant music.  He may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades.  Buy this CD.  You won't regret it. It sounds best in the early evening.  I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go
