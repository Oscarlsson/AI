I saw these guys live in the Twin Cities last week. They opened for Keane and The Zutons. These guys were definitely the best part of the show. They had great energy and actually looked like they were having fun. To top it off, they sounded great and their songs were well written. Give these guys a shot, unless you hate Rock 'n' Roll!!
