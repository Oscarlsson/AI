i'm a spanish fan of soul music of the 90's.
these days is almost impossible to find a good soul/r&b cd to purchase. 
In the 90's i had to buy about 2 or 3 cds per week. Now, with all the rap & hip hop topping the charts,what kind of music could i purchase?  LUTHER, ANITA, LALAH, SMOOTH JAZZ & maybe, some Joe's cd. AND OF COURSE, THIS TERRIFIC CD BY mr.BENSON.

If you're a fan of good r&b music and you hate the hip hop music, buy this cd NOW!!!!  You won't regret!
