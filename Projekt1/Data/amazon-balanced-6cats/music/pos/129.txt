I just bought this on CD as it was on sale through the CD club.  I have the original vinyl, but hadn't listened to it in years.  

This is one of the best works of music ever conceived, written and performed.  It is absolutely timeless and each song impresses you more than the last.  Put this one on repeat and let it play three or four times. It just keeps getting better.

Stevie is an awesome talent and this may be his best.  Don't forget how great music was in the 70's.  This work is one of the major reasons for the resurgence of 70's music today by artists that weren't even born then.  You can see quite clearly the artists that followed Stevie.  Most recently Alicia Keys who would be the first to say his music is pure inspiration
