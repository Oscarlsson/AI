   I can honestly say that when I first heard Scarling's "So Long, Scarecrow", I was less than impressed. I've been into Scarling for a few years now, and when I heard their first record,"Sweet Heart Dealer", I instantly fell in love. I somewhat held it above everything else, I was so impressed by it. So when I heard the progression from SHD to SLS, I was a little bit let down.

   But after three solid listens, from first to last, I was totally amazed by this record. It was like something clicked and I was able to see the beauty each track held. I seriously listen to this CD almost everyday. Although I prefer some tracks to others [(Northbound on) Cauhenga!], I really can't think of one track that I just don't like. It now takes place in my favorites over SHD.

  I feel that this record can really appeal to anyone; it's very versatile. And, as always, Jessicka's beautiful vocals compliment the indescribable amazingness of the music wonderfully. If you're indecisive about purchasing this record, I say bite the bullet, give it a few solid listens, and promptly be blown away
