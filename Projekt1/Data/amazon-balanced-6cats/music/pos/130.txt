I just refreshed my ears listening to "Riot" again! Getting to to hear 1/2 Full, which clocking in at just over 4 minutes, is sheer electric blues magic. The price of this album is worth this one rocker alone. 
It was nice to see it on "Easy Street" (along with Lukin' Excellent!)any way this number totally kicks!   Definitely get this if you don't already own it.
