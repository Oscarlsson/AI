Grew up on this group. Love them then and love them now. Own the &quot;Best of&quot; Collection but you can never compile the best on one CD. For those Winans fans you know what I'm talking about. These brothers are music genuises especially Marvin Winans. Like Stevie Wonder they were ahead of their time. My favorite song on this album shares the message of all times. &quot;Together We Stand&quot; opens up the eyes to all race,religion, and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background. Entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Teddy Riley, and Aaron Hall.  I like the flavor the cameos add to this album. If you're into mid-tempo music this is the album to purchase
