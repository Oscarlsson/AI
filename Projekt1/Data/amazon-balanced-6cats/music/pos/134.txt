For those who have only heard the hits this is a fine addition for your collection.  Bruce and the boys were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long jams you find here.  The title sums up the overall feeling of the songs.  There's a certain joy and a ton of fun to be had.  Put this on one nice warm spring day and see if it doesn't lift your mood.  Caution: must be listened to while drinking a cold domestic beer
