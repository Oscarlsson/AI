John Michael Mongomery is back with a big bang.  This album is one of the best to come out this year. It's better than that of Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson, and Kenny Chesney.  The song I wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since Alan's Where Were you.  He mixes the soulful ballads, with his country rockers, and sweet love songs.  THis is vinatage JMM and should be bought by any true country music fan
