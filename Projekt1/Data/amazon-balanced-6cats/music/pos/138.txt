Ok, i just could not resist coming on here to review this. I've had this CD for about 4 years now and I STILL listen to quite a bit, proof right there that this CD is definetly a classic (in my book at least) Every single song on here is original, the guitar riffs are simply amazing, and the lyrics i can not even describe in words how much they hit home and how breathtaking they are. If your a Goo Goo Doll fan, and you still do not have this CD, i deeply encourge you to go buy it now! This is The is The Goos like you've never heard them before. The CD is pure genius, and in my opinion the best cd i've ever heard
