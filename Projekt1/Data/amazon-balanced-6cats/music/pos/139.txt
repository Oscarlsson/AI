This has been my first cd of Rod Stewart and I am very proud to have this cd,because worth every penny.
 This CD has class. Congratulations to the men behind. The duet with Cher "Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered" is the best song.duet with Queen Latifah "As Time Goes By," I was astonish, She has a nice voice TOO!!. All songs are relaxings. Actually ,I listen  this cd before to go bed
