Actually haven't heard this CD, yet, I can still comment on part of it. I was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the X-Ray Cafe.   Sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking, "I wonder if they ever did anything with those masters?"

So, I was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out (which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour,  but they knew the X-Ray was special and gave it their all)- It was all captured on these recordings.  

The machine was a Tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings. Most all the mics were either Shure SM57/58, but there was also a high quality Shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage.  

The X-Ray was perfect for this type of recording. The tiny PA was only used for the vocals, so, there was no competing with a PA blasting everything.  I would place a SM-57 close to every amp.  Had a nice specialtiy bass mic, too.  Usually, 8 channels was enough to catch everything, but, there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed. Because of the overhead stereo catching the drums, this was rarely needed.

With a full house, such as the night with The Gits, any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd, creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space.  There was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the X-Ray "business office" next door, which is where the Tascam was setup away from any real danger.  All of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show.  Every once in a while, magic happened.
