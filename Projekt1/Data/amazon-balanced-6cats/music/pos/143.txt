I've been a Jim Brickman fan for a few years now.  When I saw this CD came out, I could not resist getting it.  It is absolutely amazing and fully worth it.  When I first put it in my stereo, I had to sit there just to listen to the first few tracks without doing anything.  That was how impressive they were.  The title of the album is incredibly fitting.  While my roommate is venting about the latest drama in her group of friends, I have this CD turned up in my own little corner to "Escape" from it all.  I swear I could not have found anything more fitting to be listening to while trying to get away from real life for a bit.  If you love Jim Brickman, or just like soft jazz, or piano music, this CD is a must have
