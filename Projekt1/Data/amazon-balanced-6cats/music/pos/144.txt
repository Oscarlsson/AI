"I have been a Brickman fan since the very first album. Much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much "electronic enhancement." Escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums. There are three excellent vocals on the CD that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano. 

If you are a Brickman fan, this is a must have album.
