  This is a good compilation of AFI's songs over the 10+ years they've been together. It's easily worthy of 10 stars. This CD allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to Sing The Sorrow, and to get more intimate with the band. I havn't purchased this album YET, because I already have all their albums, but plan on it. 
  The new tracks are from the Answer That, and Very Proud Of Ya era. They've finally been released on CD. This is a cool little feature fo newcomers also. 
  Anyway, buy this album only if you havn't heard any of AFIs music but want to give it a try
