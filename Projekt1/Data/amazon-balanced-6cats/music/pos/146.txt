This guy is a freak of nature! Different but in the same vein as Illinoise. I loved it..No fillers to speak of. If you liked some of the more laid back songs on Illinoise!, you'll LOVE this album. Its great regardless.
Highlights are:
Avalanche
Adlai Stevenson
Saul Bellow
The Mistress Witch From McClure 
Springfiel, Or Bobby Got A Shadfly Caught In His Hair	
No Man's Land	
The Perpetual Self, Or "What Would Saul Alinsky Do?
