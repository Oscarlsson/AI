Having read some of the reviews here I just thought I should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band! While the singer (Conor Oberst) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands, he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout (unlike a band like Taking Back Sunday)

The music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental, the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punk-politics band and don't come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit.

If you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to Bright Eyes, if you want to do something about it listen to Desaparecidos
