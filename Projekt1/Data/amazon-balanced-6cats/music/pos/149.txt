Anyone who had access to a radio in the 80's would know at least two songs by Missing Persons.  Their fun music and amazing flare (Dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great!) make this a good party album.  I also have their album Color In Your Life and most of the songs are great.  Just as an added note, Warren Cuccarullo is now a member of Duran Duran (my personal favorite band) and has been since he appeared on their Notorious album which was released in 1986!!
