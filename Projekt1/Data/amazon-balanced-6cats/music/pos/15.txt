There is a saying in the construction industry "Tripping over dollars to pick up nickels." Or in the regular world "Can't see the Black Forest for the trees."

I doubt if there IS an definitive rendition of all of Beethoven's symphonies. Even the composers own conducted versions changed over time and from performance to performance depending on the players or his intentions. Instruments were constantly changing and you know this guy was never satisfied, always stretching. We can only guess what his EXACT intentions would be today or tomorrow. 

What you want to remember is:

1) The first version of anything you seriously like will color your listenings of subsequent versions. You'll be listening for qualities that aren't there and missing qualities that are there.

2) Different versions bring us different views. Isn't that a good thing? Sound in all it's forms is preferable than a useless search for the best sound. I'd rather have that kind of an attitude than the bickering negative perfectionist snob attitudes of some of the reviewers here.

Having said that... I love these versions. I've had them for some time. I have at least 4 versions of the symphonies. These are clear, well recorded, dynamic and straight forward. Beethoven's passion, mental range and personal warmth are within. You can easily hear the information that Beethoven wanted you to hear. Probably better than he could. No make that clearly better than he could. Ha ha!

These are solid, lovely, beautiful, and astounding. Listen to them
