When I first purchase this album the first time.  It was Exceptional then and it still is .  Exceptional and Gifted Group these Ladies rule the early 90's.  Some of my favorites Free Your Mind, My Lovin, It Ain't Over till the Fat Lady Sings, just to name a few.  Envogues voices all of them work masterfully together they way a head of their time.  As far as female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups as Supremes, Labelle, TLC the had allot orginiality and appeal that drew people to them because of the voices and their orignal material.  They are trendsetters.
Please go buy this CD.  I will buy it again myself.  I have the cassette. I need the CD for my collection.  I know they came out with a new album hopefully this will be a Great album as well.

Go Envogue G
