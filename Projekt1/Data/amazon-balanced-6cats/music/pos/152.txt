This is a Great Classic Rock CD including some timeless songs.  If you like "Summer Breeze" as much as I do and have not heard the remix of it yet, you are in for a pleasent suprise.  A remix album came out in November of 2004 called "What Is Hip" and in my opinion is the best remix album of 70's music that I've ever heard.  Their version of "Summer Breeze" is near perfect.  A modernized, but not over the top version that manages to preserve the true melody of the song with out removing the original rhythm.  The entire album is great too. I have this "Greatest Hits" and the "What Is Hip" CD and simply can't get enough.  Here's a link to the CD.  ENJOY.
