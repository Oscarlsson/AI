Ah, yes, it's Nirvana's "Nevermind" cd, released in 1991. I listen to all 80's pop-metal, or hair metal (Whitesnake, Winger, Van Halen, Y&T, Dokken) I could go on forever on 80's bands. (Of course there is Rick Springfield, and John Cougar Mellencamp). I am a true rocker here, I know all the true bands out there, I know everything about them. I have reasons for this.

But here's the bottom line. Nirvana was a breakthough along with Soundgarden and Pearl Jam back in the early 90's. Millions of people bought those cds. And yes, there were hair bands still alive back then, like Poison, and Firehouse, etc. Firehouse and Poison had alot of success, eventhough it wasn't the 80's anymore.

As I can see, alot of my fellow rockers don't really like Nirvana, or Pearl Jam, or Soundgarden. To be completely honest, I like their music, I just don't prefer the music, because I don't like the hard sound. I really like the glam-hair band style.

People say: "Nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam-metal". Yes, I agree that they killed the 80's hair bands, but it's not necessarly their fault. It's a mix between the bands, and the people listenting to the music. Because of grundge music, today's music is quite horrifying, with EMO and other types of music that would've been a nightmare back in those days.

Nirvana has a great CD here, but I just don't prefer it. If you are a REAL rocker, you'll listen to all the types of music back then. Don't judge unless you have actually heard it, because you may actually like it.

To all rockers- Don't listen to modern music. It's poisoning our people, and no one really understands the true meaning of "the guitar" in today's music. Most of you will understand what I mean, so listen to the classics.

Classic rock, and hair bands forever, and even grunge. Keep the classic alive.
