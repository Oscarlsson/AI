This is a fantastic album. The fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release (and they're not the beatles or u2 or anything) should speak volumes. I have played this CD countless times over the years and I am amazed that I am not sick of it. I am a pretty constant consumer of new music. Get this CD - you won't regret it! (PS I've never done an Amazon review before, but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me). It is melodic, catchy, uplifting and cheeky - in short, a little piece of musical bliss.
