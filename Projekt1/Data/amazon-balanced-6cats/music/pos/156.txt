This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption.
Now don't get me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great, does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same time: Can's "Future Days"(1973); Nue!'s "2"(1973); King Crimson's "Larks' Tongues In Aspic"(1973); Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom"(1974); Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra"(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard 'Piper'.
