This was the first Punk-O-Rama CD I listened to, and boy I was not dissapointed. Most of the songs on this CD are the type of punk I would listen to, Quite fast and energetic. The best song on the CD has to be either NOFX - Bath of Least Resistance (NOFX being the greatest punk band of all time, of course), or Beatsteaks - Let me in. I heard the Beatsteaks for the first time on this CD and there absolutely bloody excellent. Obviously, The Cd is made complete with songs from the Descendents, Pulley, Pennywise, Dropkick Murphy's. The only let down on this CD is Noise Conspiracy, there song on this CD, well plainly sucks i'm sorry to say. But overall this CD is one hell of a good listen if your into punk. That's all, oh yeah, buy it! by
