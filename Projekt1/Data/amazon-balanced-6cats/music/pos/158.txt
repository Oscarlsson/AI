Neil Young's latest release has some very clever and interesting songs.  They are very political so unless you are a completest who likes Neil Young, if you agree with President Bush, this album will be a turn-off.  For the politically neutral or those who agree with Neil Young this is a good album.  Maybe this is not Neil Young's best but it still is a good album
