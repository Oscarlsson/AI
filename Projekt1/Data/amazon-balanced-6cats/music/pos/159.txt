Gun's & Roses came out in the nick of time. Record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands and they all sound the same. G&R made their debut on the music scene in 87 but didn't get big until almost late 88 early 89. Appitite is a true masterpiece. Welcome to the Jungle, It's So Easy, Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle....The list goes on and on. Put it in turn it up to 10 and Rock On! The they made a mistake. they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums. So instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums. Then they vanished. Anyone who is a fan of the music but couldn't care less about Axl should pick up Velvet Revolver with Slash and Scott Wieland from Stone Temple Pilots
