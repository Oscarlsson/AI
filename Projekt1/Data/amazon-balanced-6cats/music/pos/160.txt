Being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals, I must say I rate this as &quot;one of the best&quot;.  The dancers are fantastic!  the music utterly great, The choice of dances  (from classical to rock) is highly deversified.   CAN'T WAIT TILL I GET IT  SO I CAN PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AS WELL AS &quot;ROCK THE HOUSE, SHAKE MY  BOOTIE, ETC&quot
