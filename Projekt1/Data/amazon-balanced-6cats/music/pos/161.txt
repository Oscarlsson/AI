Digressing from their first 2 albums, Transmutation(5 stars)and Sacrifist( 5 stars),  Praxis unleashes Metatron.  Trimmed down to a 3 piece with Laswell, Bucket and Brain covering all bases,  Metatron lacks Bootsy's space bass,  Yamatsuka Eye's agonizing screams or John Zorn's out of tune saxamaphoning, but it still rocks. track 1 is a laid back acoustic # and is absolutly beautiful. The album lacks the speed of some of Sacrifist's songs but makes up in phat grooves.  Half of the Collection cd(again 5 stars) is from this album, but with nothing from Transmutation, hmmm.  Instead of going further Ill' say this.... Get THIs Album at alll costs.  Burn copies for friends and spread the gospel according to Praxis
