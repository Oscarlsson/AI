Okay, take everything that you know about John Squire. Strip away the amazing Stone Roses first album, the not so amazing follow up, the nice brit pop of his work with the Seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and I honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically. They would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful, the vocals might be grating at first (Think Robert Forster (The Go-betweens) circa Before Hollywood) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving. What you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception. People should listen to it for what it is and not for what John Squire was...John Squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do (who hasn't moved on in 13 years? minus Robert Smith of course!) and now writes beautiful pop songs...John Squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that
