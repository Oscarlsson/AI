I'll have to accept that even tough I'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release, the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there.  For me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album, it's very melodic and more mature.  Also the acoustic version of "the diary of jane" is amazing.  I personally recommend the songs "breath", "evil angel" and my favorite "dance with the devil"
