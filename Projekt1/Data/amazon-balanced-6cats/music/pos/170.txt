A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What You Do To Me, and Is This Music?
