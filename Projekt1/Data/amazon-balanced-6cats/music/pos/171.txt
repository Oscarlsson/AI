I recently purchased this cd again. I once owned it on cassette.
Keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music and
sound has sustained very well since it was released in the early
90's. If you are building an old school collection with great
singers this is a good one to have. It's great for romance or
with that special lady.          Jaye Price
