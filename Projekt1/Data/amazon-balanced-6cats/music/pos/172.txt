Recorded 2001 - 2002.

It has become all too common that few are taken to task for saying or doing stupid things.  What's worse is that no one seems to care. 

This is the kind of thing that pisses Lewis Black off. The angrier he gets the funnier he is.

I first came to appreciate Mr. Black on the Comedy Central's "Daily Show."  I always felt that there should have been more time devoted to Lewis Black.

I wanted more - I needed more - I had to have more!

So I went to my "mental health club," Amazon.com and bought every title available.

The End of the Universe, Rules of Engagement and Luther Burbank Preforming Arts Center Blues - ( I had already purchased the White Album)

Which one is the best?  ALL OF THEM!

As I write this review - I realize that I still want more - so I am buying the DVD's.

There is nothing dated about this material. In 2006 it is just as - if not funnier than when first released.

Please Lewis keep recording it still is not enough!
