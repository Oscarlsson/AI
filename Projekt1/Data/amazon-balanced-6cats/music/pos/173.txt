This is my favorite Bob Dylan album. The album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever, Like a Rolling Stone and my favorite Desolation Row. Sandwiched in between are some fantastic songs. The album is filled with incredible lyrics,wonderful music, and a mean harmonica. If you want to know why Bob Dylan is a legend buy this album
