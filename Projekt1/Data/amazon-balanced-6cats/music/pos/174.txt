It's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now. I think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. But it didn't. It came out in the summer of 1979. It was the summer before my sophomore year in college, my first summer away from home. For at least a week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select side 1 of "Rust Never Sleeps." It took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over. And then, when I did, for the next week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select Side 2 of "Rust Never Sleeps." My flatmates never complained.

Oddly, the songs I see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves. You don't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar, contagious handclaps, and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of "Welfare Mothers," now, do you really? As for "Sedan Delivery," I have only the vaguest clue of what it's about, but it's sure a scorcher (and it's still hard to find a job). Allright, maybe we don't need two versions of "Hey Hey, My My," but which one would you delete? 

As far as I'm concerned, there's only one song here that hasn't withstood the test of time: "Sail Away," which is innocuously pretty, but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff. "Trasher" and "Pocahontas" are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places. Poor Marlon, poor CSN.

Do I wax nostalgiac? Perhaps, but not overly so. This remains essential Neil, which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets. It still sounds fresh and relevant. And fun. Did I mention fun? In fact, I'm gonna go plunk it on right now, maybe take a breather between "Sail Away" and "Powderfinger" to relive the LP experience. You should too.
