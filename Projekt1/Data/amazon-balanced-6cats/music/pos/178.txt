I purchased this CD during the lowest time of my life emotionally. Every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief, especially the title track, Deep Peace. I would listen to it over and over, bathing in the lush healing sounds. Each element, from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs, is seemingly structured at a spiritual level. This is more than ambient music, it's true music therapy.
