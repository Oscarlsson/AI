The Edward Scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores.  I truly believe this is Danny Elfman's best score and believe me, he's done some great scores!  The music is so moving.  The childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet, beautiful film.  Even people who haven't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials.  A must-have for any Danny Elfman and/or Tim Burton fan
