Jodeci's Forever My Lady has a problem that most nineties R&B releases had at that time, if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa. Jodeci's first CD had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one CD in 1991. Stay, Forever My Lady, Come & Talk To Me, U&I,and I'm Still Waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash
