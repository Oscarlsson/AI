This book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom, and the natural things all animals do. It teaches them to be comfortable with - without shame - the move from being a diaper-clad baby to a big kid. The drawings are charming! I bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction
