Goth meets Cabaret, or rather Gothic music influenced by Cabaret. Thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by Projekt. The eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the "dark cabaret" scene, and do so quite well. The first song, Coin-Operated Boy by the Dresden Dolls, is a great start, and the CD continues onward to devious Evil Night Together by Jill Tracy (which sets up a wonderful film noir mood) and on to the darker, electronic dance number Cabaret Fortune Teller by Audra, to a remix of Knock Three Times on My Coffin by Projekt veterans Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Along the way numerous other bands are covered.

Sam Rosenthal's side project Revue Noir makes their debut on this CD, with husky feminine vocals provided by Nicki Jaine, who also has a solo song (Pretty Faces) on the CD as well. Personally, I LOVED Revue Noir and find Nicki Jaine's voice to be quite alluring, but I also know some BTfaBG fans who dislike her vocals so you've been warned. But all in all, I think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this CD. At the very least, its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style, and thats always a good thing
