This is an amazing, beautiful album.  Probably a little more difficult to get into than Streethawk, but after about the 4th or 5th listen, I found it more rewarding.  The music is very dense, and the lyrics are beautifully poetic (it helps that Dan Bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time).  A great album for any fan of intelligent independent music
