(In reference to another review) - The symbol on the cover of Still is the Factory Records logo, Joy Division's record label.  

Since I'm in the area....  I've owned this album for about 15 years and it still sounds, in parts, as solid as anything Joy Division ever did.  Some of the live stuff is so-so but studio tracks like The Kill, Dead Souls, Exercise One, They Walked In Line and Something Must Break are damn near worth the price of admission alone.  If you already like Joy Division, thereby showing good taste, this is a great album.  If you find yourself slowly descending beneath the black cloud of depression, Unknown Pleasures should fit.  If you have been there and find yourself wanting out, Closer is the soundtrack.  This album is more varied in mood, for established fans and safer for household pets
