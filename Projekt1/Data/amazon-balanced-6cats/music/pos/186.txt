I love this soundtrack! It stands alone as beautiful, haunting, alluring, and innocent--just as Griet herself was in the film. Desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story, enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar.

Scarlett Johanssen's acting is superb, as well as Essie Davis and Colin Firth. The story, though, was a bit tired--pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. Its portrayal of Vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people, even though it is a fictionalized account.

The two best tracks on this album are 'Griet's Theme' and 'Colours in the Clouds'. While I'm not keen on seeing the film again, this soundtrack is a treasure. It's a real work of art, second only to Vermeer's work
