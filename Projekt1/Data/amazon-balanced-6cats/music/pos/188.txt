Hayley Westenra, at only 18 years old, is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come. This is an uplifting and at times, spiritual album that shows shades of greatness. Throughout, Westenra's voice is captivating, though the musical scores are at times, sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent. 

There was an advertising tag on this CD that stated "The female Josh Grobin", but I think a more accurate sentiment would be "a young Sarah Brightman". ODYSSEY is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes, all of which match up well with Westenra's abilities. Bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet, Dell Amore Non Si Sa. They pair up for that one song, but the rest is all Westenra. 

This is smooth, soothing and easy listening. If you like Brightman, you will truly appreciate the voice of Westenra.
