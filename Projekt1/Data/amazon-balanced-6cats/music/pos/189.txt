In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and founder Michael Bivins.  This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on "Thank You" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both "All Around The World" and "U Know" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, "Vibin'" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.  "I Sit Away" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid and Tony Rich.  Stepping into a more modern jazz feel "Jezzebel" strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal.  Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men harmonize on "Khilil (Interlude)" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with "Trying Times" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson.  Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights "I'll Make Love To You" and "Water Runs Dry".  Heavyweights Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on "On Bended Knee".  "50 Candles" drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content "...feels like one of those nights..."  They show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on "Yesterday" they perform accapella.  If real talent that you seek, members Shawn, Michael, Nathan and Wanya has uncompromising talent for any age, era, or time that you can enjoy for long time.
