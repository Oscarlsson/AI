to set the record straight, rodney 'darkchild' jerkins produced ONE song on this album, and that is 'he said'.

that said, producer waryn 'baby dubb' campbell [also husband of erika, younger of the duo] did a great job on this album.  not at all to say that the ladies' singing hasn't always been phenomenal.

the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song, a guest apperance by fred hammond on 'this love' [their appearance on his album, speak those things' is duly noted], an impressively done cover of stevie wonder's 'you will know', and a cover of walter hawkins' 'thank you'.  yes, that is the original sampled at the end of the song.

every album that mary mary has released to this day [yes, all two of them] has proven that gospel music can be musically current-- impressive-- and still within taste.  that's what happens when you have the best on your team...

baby dubb, while being mary mary's resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard's 'let go', 'sweetest thing', 'all i am', fred hammond's albums 'speak those things' and 'somethin' 'bout love' and countless other records.

the downside:  the last two songs.  they're of forgettable quality.  while happy, forgettable.  overall, this album is an essential
