If you think yer gonna puke everytime you have to suffer through a "country" song from Nashville these days, and you happen to like classic rock, you would probably appreciate what Shooter's trying to do here. Folks, this is the Real Deal. I don't mean real country or real rock - this is a hybrid - I mean he's making music that is honest and down to earth. A flash in the pan, he's not. He's going to be around for awhile
