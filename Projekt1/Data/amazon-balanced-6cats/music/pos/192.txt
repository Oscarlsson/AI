Tom DeLonge is at it again with a new band and a new album.  Even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from Boxcar Racer, Angels and Airwaves managed to have a completely different sound.  They dropped the more punk rock tone of Boxcar Racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of rock.  The first released single "The Adventure" is quite enjoyable and even though I haven't checked too deeply into it, I think it's the theme song for NBC's Studio 60.

Besides, how can you go wrong with an album that's gone double platinum in the UK and gold in Canada
