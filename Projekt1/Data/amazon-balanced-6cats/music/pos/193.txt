After watching the movie walk the line, I wanted to hear more of Johnny Cash. All these years(35 of them) I always thought he was just a slow folk singer. His music is non-stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff. He toured with Elvis Presely and Jerry Lee Lewis. He inspired musicians like Bob Dylan. I am so glad I bought this CD. It's the best purchase I made all year.
