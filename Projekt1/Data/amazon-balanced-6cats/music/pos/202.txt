What can I say that most of the people reviewing this cd haven't already said.
Arthur is OUTRAGEOUSLY talented. It's almost shocking.
The depth of songwriting and production values are so intense. 
It's extremely well recorded and mixed music. 
Anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now.
"Stumble and Pain" is probably my favourite track. The sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb.
As with all Arthur albums the vocals are dense, layered, and its something he's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album!
Anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption's  son straight after that.
