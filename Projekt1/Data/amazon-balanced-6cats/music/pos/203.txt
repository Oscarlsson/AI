First up I give this album a 4.5/5 for the fac that it has REAL hiphop beats and good lyrics. Real hiphop, they stayed true to the sound. I just didnt give it a 5 since im not the biggest TCQ fan and of that style. But all these emcees spit hott lyrics in this album. Tracks like "Keep It Movin", "Hot Sex" have ill beats. This album does have a real jazzy sound to it, which im not the biggest fan of, but its more of a unique style, and they deserve props for trying new styles. So overall this is a really good album, and worth getting.
