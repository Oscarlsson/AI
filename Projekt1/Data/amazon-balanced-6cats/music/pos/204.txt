Try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums.  Let me give you one ground rule though:  It has to be from a band that put out at least five albums (so no Stone Roses, Sugar, Verve or Jane's Addiction, e.g.).  Here are some of mine, off the top of my head: Led Zeppelin I, In the Court of the Crimson King, Days of Future Passed, The Doors, Boy (U2), C.S.N., Can't Buy a Thrill (Steely Dan), Ten (Pearl Jam), Murmur (REM).  I'm sure there are a number of others that I'm forgetting.  Oh yeah, one more: the incredible "Ferment," by Catherine Wheel.

The harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by Rob Dickinson and Brian Futter, the compelling rhythms generated by Dave Hawes (Bass) and Neil Sims (Percussion), it just all works, and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary "Nowhere" by Ride (not quite as great as "Loveless" by My Bloody Valentine).  Unfortunately, C.W. never quite matched the power of "Ferment" with their subsequent releases.

The best song on the album is "Black Metallic" ("it's the color of her skin/ her skin is black metallic") which soars up to the sky, floats in the wind, lands, and soars again.  Clearly, "Black Metallic" clocks in as the band's "Stairway to Heaven."  The second best song on "Ferment" is . . . well that's where it gets tricky, and demostrates how great this album is.  There are no weak or even average songs, and I could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a runner up to "Black Metallic."  Put a gun to my head and I would have to go with "Shallow" or maybe "Tumbledown" or perhaps, if I'm in a more pop oriented mood, the danceable "I Want to Touch You."  Although, last night, as I was listening to the album in preparation for this review, I thought of how strongly it closes with the trio ""Bill and Ben," "Salt" and the uplifting "Balloon" ("ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon").

A wonderful album.  Perhaps not in my top ten, but definitely in my top twenty (tied with the aforementioned "Nowhere")
