I bought a copy for a friend recently and she said "His music sounds so fresh and it's so singable.  The lyrics are meaty, too, not just fluffy pop. I'm kind of obsessing over this music right now--which is fun!  Thanks so much... I'd like to see him in concert sometime." I had this album for a year before I really got into it, since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate.  At first listen I really liked We'll Do It All Again, and put it onto my MP3.  A year later I finally got the album out again and it bleu me away.  I realize that there is something slightly Barry Mannilowish about We'll Do It All Again, because he has some lungs, not because of style or anything.  He reminds me more of Jellyfish, or They Might Be Giants.  Some songs are so pathetic, vulnerable, and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go, but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery.  Anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album.  The songwriting is superb and precisely produced. The second hidden track is a real gem, that you don't need to relate to in order to appreciate.  The lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness.
