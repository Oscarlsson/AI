I've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite.  It's a cd that I can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy.  This would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island.  It never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good Schon is.  Unbelievable. If you like this, you'll like Eric Johnson's Venus Isle album too.  Two of my all time favorites
