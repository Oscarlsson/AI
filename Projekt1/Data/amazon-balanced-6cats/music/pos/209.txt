This might be the best CD that has come out this year.  It may be Will Oldham's best CD since "Viva Last Blues." It may be better than "Viva Last Blues" although these are two different styled CDs.  "The letting go" has a mostly very mellow sound.  Almost every song is beautiful.  The string and guitar melodies are uplifting.  Will Oldham's voice is grounding, it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or so.  Dawn McCarthy's voice will then again lift you up.  McCarthy's voice is a fantastic companion to Oldham's.  Other singers/bands have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead vocal and it has often become irritating.  This is not the case with "the letting go," McCarthy's accompaniment adds so much to the album but without taking away from Oldham.  I haven't listened to a Will Oldham album since "Ease down the Road." This makes me want to go back and listen to those albums I have missed.  One song in particular, "The Seedling" (I believe) has a different sound than the rest of the album.  It has a harsher sound, but is still a good song.  
This is a great introduction if you are new to Oldham or if you are returning listener.
