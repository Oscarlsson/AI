This is a wonderful effort by the Del Castillo brothers and their band. Mark and Rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that I have ever heard. I hate that anyone would compare them to the Gypsy Kings or Strunz and Farrah, because I believe they (Del Castillo) are far superior. Even though I am a huge fan of Santana, I think Brothers of the Castle and Vida are more entertaining and satisfying than Santana's last CD. If you are a fan of this genre, you should possess both Del Castillo CD's.....Brothers of the Castle and Vida. Their live show is among the best that I have ever seen
