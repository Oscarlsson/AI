As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge", Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best albums of the 90's.

"New Power Generation" serves as the title track to Prince's new band, and it's a powerful, funky manifesto. "The Question of U" is exotic and intoxicating. "Elephants and Flowers" is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption, whereas "Tick Tick Bang" is Prince at his most joyously raunchy. Although most of Prince's material is exceptionally strong here, the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag. "We Can Funk" is a simmering duet between Prince and funkmaster George Clinton, and Tevin Campbell provides some youthful exuberance to "Round and Round". But the tracks by The Time mostly fall flat. I've personally always found Morris Day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine, and his one trick gets boring quickly.

It's obvious that with "Graffiti Bridge" Prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party. But I can't help but wonder, without the tracks featuring other artists, if "Graffiti Bridge" wouldn't be more highly regarded as one of Prince's better albums
