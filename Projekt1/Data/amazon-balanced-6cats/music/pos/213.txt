At first, I thought the only reason why I wanted this CD was because Idina Menzel was on it. But now, after listening to the whole CD, I was right, Idina Menzel was AMAZING, and all of the other cast members are incredibly talented too.

I would HIGHLY recommend this because it is a very interesting story, it's incredibly complex music (theoretically), but at the same time it is VERY enjoyable!!!! I would give it more stars if I could... but I am only allowed 5... :(
