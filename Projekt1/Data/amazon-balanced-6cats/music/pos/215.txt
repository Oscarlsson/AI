It realy has been a long wait after Jellyfish. This Roger Joseph Manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get, giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way. If you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel. 
And don't wait for the US release: it lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the Japanese has. I sure wouldn't want to miss any of these tracks. Very higly recommended!
