I have loved the Swans since my Danceteria days in early 80s New York. But its a fitful, frustrating love. You get the sense from 'Incandesent' that the Swans forgot to stop partying.  That they never took the time to put together more than a handful of songs.  Oh, but what songs they were.  This collection is for completists and aging post-punker (like myself) who wished they'd shared a pint with the boys back when simply getting stoned was a subversive act. Its a nice collection of beautiful, quirky oddities here. But a few gems are missing "Holy Holy", "1982", "World of Milk and Blood" come to mind. Maybe on an 'Ashes' reissue.  In the meantime, scoop this up.  Simpson & Company deserve the attention. If you really care about the band, buy it directly from their label, Renascent. That way the company (and the band) can make a few pennies. Maybe enough to mine the crates for a second hits collection.
