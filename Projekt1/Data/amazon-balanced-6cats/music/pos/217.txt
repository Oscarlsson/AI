Buy it. Now. Stop reading. 


Are you still reading???? Okay, so I'll tell you my reason why. Reason(s) why. 5.1 sound. DTS. Different (some versions better to my ears/psyche) than the CD. Flavor. Beautiful production. Did I mention DTS - you gotta hear this in DTS. And she and her band deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her (gratuitously inciting flaming). 

I am just hoping that she will give us the opportunity to have DVD's covering her 'Girl in the Other Room' and her 'From This Moment On'.
