I love this album, the best of Phil Collins.  I believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut.  I know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife.  He did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well.  He is a great composer.  Too bad most of his new songs...2006, times are different and so is his life, I do not enjoy them as much.  Once an artist becomes more Self-Actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory.
