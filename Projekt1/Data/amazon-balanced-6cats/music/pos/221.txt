I wore out my tape of Cypress.  Afoot is great, but Cypress is amazing.  I bought this while stationed in the Army.  There weren't too many "new wave" tapes available at the PX, and I wasn't going to listen to Def Leppard or Bon Jovi.  So I bought Cypress.

One of those rare tapes that I bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months (The Jam's Snap and Setting Sons, and The Smith's Hatful of Hollow are 3 other tapes I never tired of). 

Get this CD.  Get it now!   It is great.   Thanks for reissuing it.
