And you will to. This music conveys the happy feeling of Latin music produced for the American ear from 1946 to 1949. I picked up the album from Amazon after listening to selected cuts offered by the Yahoo Music radio service -- "El Cumbanchero" and "Cuban Pete". The cuts are almost all strong and all are well recorded, especially when you compare the sound quality to those on some other big band recordings that have been reissued.
   "Babalu" which became Desi Arnez signature piece on the I Love Lucy TV show is probably one of the least appealing, and that may be why it was used comedically in the TV show through the years. The highlight cuts include -- "Peanut Vender", "Holiday in Havana", "You Can in Yucatan" and "Brazil". While brass, strings, drums and guitars tend to dominate much of today's music, this album gives the spotlight to a variety of percussion instruments, flute, clarinet and bass clarinet. It is refreshing to hear them in solo.
   The liner notes by Will Friedwald are extensive and give you a glimpse into this period of Desi's life between his movie career and the defining work he and Lucille Ball did on television in the 50's.
   I could not recommend this album more and hope you enjoy it as much as I did
