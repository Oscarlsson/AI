I purchased this CD with the intent of finding fine players playing fine music. What I found, however, was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest. The ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble music playing recorded. Each player displays exceptional technique, both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their playing. Most impressive is listening to Istomen who, playing a very technically and lyrically demanding part, voices his playing with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings; a feat very difficult to do as a pianist. This is an excellent recording for the professional to study a score from or for the avid listener to play over and over
