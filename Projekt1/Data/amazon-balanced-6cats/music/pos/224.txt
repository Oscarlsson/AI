THIS ALBUM MARKED A RETURN OF SORTS TO THE OLD TRADEMARK ISLEY BROTHERS SOUND,AND IT'S OFF THE HOOK.JAM AND TERRY,STEVE HUFF,RAFEAL SADDIQ,KELLY AND ANGELA WINBUSH ALL TOOK THEIR TURNS PUTTIN' IT DOWN,AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.FROM THE TIME MOVE YOUR BODY KICKS IN UNTIL THE VERY END THIS ALBUM IS ABSOLUTELY SLAMMIN'.HIGHLIGHTS IN MY OPINION ARE YOU DESREVE BETTER,JUST LIKE THIS,WARM SUMMER NIGHT AND MOVE YOUR BODY.BUT THE ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT AND(in my opinion)ONE OF THE MOST SLEPT ON SONGS OF ALL TIMES IS THE TITLE CUT ETERNAL.THAT IS ONE OF MY TOP TEN ISLEY BROTHERS FAVORITES OF ALL TIMES.THE SONG KIND OF REMINDS ME OF MAKE ME SAY IT AGAIN,AND EARNIE SHOWED ALL THE WAY OUT ON THE GUITAR SOLO ON THAT SONG.CONTAGIOUS EVEN HAD A BIT OF THE ISLEYS SOUND AND PROBABLY INTRODUCED THEM TO A WHOLE NEW AUDIENCE.AS A WHOLE,I AM EXTREMELY FOND OF THIS ALBUM
