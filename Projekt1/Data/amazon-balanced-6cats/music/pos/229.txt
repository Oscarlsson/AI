Gene Watson was one of the finest voices in country music, and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice.  Considered by some to be "hard country", I find Gene Watson to have a more "pop" oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs;  and in the '70's, that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts.  While many of the songs on this album are pure country, others are the typical, drab, 70's pop that filled the void between the Nashville Sound and the New Traditional era of the 80's.  In any case, there is no doubt that Gene Watson earned his spot in Country Music, and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today;  including his signature songs "Farewell Party" and "Love in the Hot Afternoon".  If you prefer the more traditional country sound, his "You Could Know as Much About a Stranger" and "Should I Come Home" are also included
