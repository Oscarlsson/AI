Wonderful instrumentals and lyrics.  A Shenandoah Lullaby is simply beautiful.  I love the way the ending segues into Brahm's lullaby.   His version of Arkansas traveller is refreshing.  Teddy Bears' Picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard.  There Ain't No Bugs On Me is my two-year-old daughter's favorite, judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time.  I like all the songs on the CD.  A breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop.
