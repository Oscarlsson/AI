Gene Watson's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for Sonny James, Ernest Tubb, and Dottie West.  I had never heard of him but then when I heard his voice on the CD I knew the songs.  It's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should.  Every song is great but the one which I really like is &quot;The Old Man and His Horn&quot;.  This was a song I had never heard.  It also shows the versatility of Gene's song selections.  He has the best voice of any country singer I have ever heard
