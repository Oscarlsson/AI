Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not ONE bad song.  When you listen to one of their albums in your car, there's no, "Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over."  Now it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are the first five, and "Houses of the Holy" is the fifth one.  This is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never fall from.

"The Song Remains the Same" is Pagey at his best with his Gibson double-neck.  The song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy, but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune.  Page's initial (and INCREDIBLE) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album.
"The Rain Song" is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood.  The lyrics are deep, and while the song to me is melancholy, it is also refreshing.
"Over the Hills and Far Away" is a 5-trillion star song, with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics.
"The Crunge" is groovy and funny.  The bass is really felt in this song, and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh.
"Dancing Days" is very far out, but a summer-y song with an addictive riff.
"D'yer Mak'er" is one to definitely highlight Bonzo's masterful rhythm skills, or in other words, GREAT DRUMS!  Equal to that is Pagey on guitar and Robert's singing, "I still love you so...but I can't let you go..."
"No Quarter" is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to John Paul for an exquisite keyboard solo.
"The Ocean" is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff.  An overall energizing song.

This is the best deal for this album--do not pass it up!  I hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song
