Trace Adkins has set them up and knocked them down once more! Can Trace ever produce any music that sounds bad? His low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from his dog to his woman to his God! 

I strongly recommend that everyone has Trace's latest CD in their collection! A big ten-four in my CD player
