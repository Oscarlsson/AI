What else can be said about this great CD?  It's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs. "Child of Vision" is the best (the piano solo is killer) of the best, but this is one of those rare CD's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end (no skipping over songs you don't like). A true classic
