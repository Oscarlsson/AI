A lot of music fans have mused over why Matthew Sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs. "Sick of Myself" single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities. But in retrospect Sweet simply wasn't a very marketable commodity for the music industry, and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow didn't grab people. Its not that he doesn't sing with passion or feeling, but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix. Perhaps its a production thing; regardless, the vocals on a MS album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter. There are some truly impressive (albeit derivative) stuff here: "What Matters" is in my opinion the greatest Byrds song never written, "Hide" is a beautiful piano ballad that wouldn't seem out of place on Badfinger compilation, "If Time Permits" has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by Brian Wilson, etc. etc. "I've Been Waiting" works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire, and "Girlfriend" is for the most part a great rocker. However, after the relatively simple production of Girlfriend, his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a "wall of sound" feeling, which quite frankly doesn't really work unless you're Phil Spector. Not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well (although I probably would have included "Evangeline" at the expense of "Ready"). Despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing. Still heartily recommended for fans of catchy, melodic pop-rock
