After Trouble and his Austin City Limits appearance, I thought he was just another very good singer songwriter.  This follow up has made me reconsider, because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist.  He waited and it was worth the wait.

This reminded me immediately of John Lennon (please don't punish me for blasphemy) and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way.

I didn't expect something this deep for a sophomore recording.  Enjoy
