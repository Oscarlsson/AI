I rarely write reviews of music but feel that I must share my impressions of this CD.  I have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of Townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records.  I finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers--Lyle Lovett-"Lungs" (among others) and Steve Earle-"Tecumseh Valley".  I was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording.  Other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other Townes' records.  I come from a different angle.  As someone who has long heard Townes sopken of with the highest praise, I can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings.  I will also say that I am deeply frustrated that I never took advantage of the chance to see Townes perform while he was alive.
