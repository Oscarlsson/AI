I've been a Robben Ford fan since 1979. Each time he offers a new recording, I try to purchase it as quickly as possible. Robben can ROCK and play slow blues. Every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again. I can't say enough! Robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation! If you like Robben Ford, don't miss Chris Cain. This man is also a guitar genius
