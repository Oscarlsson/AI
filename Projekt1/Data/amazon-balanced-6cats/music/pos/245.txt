The one song I know is a remake is "Goodnight My Love."  I know this because I have it on the original 45 issue and the CD version is an inferior remake.  But the others with which I'm familiar - but don't have original vinyl to compare, only memories - seem authentic.

The audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the CDs you find these days which are only re-recordings of old vinyl or cassettes.
