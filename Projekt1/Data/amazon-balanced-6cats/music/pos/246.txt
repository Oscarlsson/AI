I bought this CD after I'd watched the movie the first three times. The music is wonderful.  I bought it specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - "I Don't Care to Stay Here Long" and I want it played at my own funeral way out there in "someday".  You can't hear it without smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the CD than in the movie.  But just in case, here's the first foot-stompin' verse:

Fare -- well, vain world! I'm going home.
My Savior smiles and bids me come and 
I don't care to stay here long. Bright
Angels beckon me away to sing God's praise in endless day and
I don't care to stay here long.
Right up Yonder! Christians, away up Yon-der.  
Oh, yes my Lord, for I don't care to stay here long
