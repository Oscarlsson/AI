I can't even begin to say how much I love these albums (i just picked UYI 1 to write my review for both).  Everyone always says that Appetite is Guns best album...no way in hell.  The Illusion albums are so much richer.  

Now don't get me wrong, I love appetite but it is more of a party album with cool guitar work and catchy tunes.  The illusion twins are just so much deeper lyrically and have many more styles woven in and out of a hard rock framework.  

I can identify with so many of axls lyrics, and the music just makes them stand out so much more.  Slash is basically the best hard rock guitar player ever, and he has more awesome solos and leads on these albums than most guitar players have in a career.  

And the best part about these albums is that the lesser known songs are usually the best, such as: Locomotive, Bad Apples, Dont Damn Me, The Garden, Pretty Tied Up, Coma, Civil War, Get in the Ring, Breakdown, Estranged (kind of popular but still fairly unknown) 14 Years, Bad Obscession, Dust n Bones, Dead Horse, and more.  Then of course there are the hits, Dont Cry, November Rain, Knockin on Heavens Door, Live and Let Die, You Could Be Mine etc.  

The only songs i dont really like that much are My World (wtf?) and shotgun blues, but everything else is just so gdamn good.  Do yourself a favor and go buy these albums if u consider yourself a hard rock fan.  The illusion albums are art, plain and simple
