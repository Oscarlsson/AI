We started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town. As babies sometimes do, she began screaming and was unconsolable... UNTIL we turned on Rocket Ship Beach. Polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so. We played that song at least 6 times in a row that day! now that she's a little older, she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing, requesting her cd be played. 

I've always enjoyed a wide range of music, and was afraid that after having a child, we'd be reduced to listening to watered down "kid music" like that purple dinosaur and those australian guys. There is a mixture of classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all of the time. There is a good variety of instrumentation and styles. Our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often waves her arms about. 

Got kids? Buy this cd!
