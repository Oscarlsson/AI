...else if Michigan was on vinyl I would have worn it out by now.

Illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of Sufjan Stevens, and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date. However the subtle spendour of the earlier Michigan has ousted it as my favourite. Perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than Illinois, but more soulful and beautiful. Ultimately it's the one I'd take to the proverbial Desert Island.

There's not a single track in this 74 minute CD that I'd want to skip or drop from my MP3 playlist, but highlights for me are Romulus (gentle and heartbreaking), Sleeping Bear (musically gorgeous), and Vito's Ordination Song (like being gently hugged).

p.s. So often the 'bonus tracks' on a CD can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my CD (Marching Band and Pickerel Lake) are both excellent.
