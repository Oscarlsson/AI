His singing style is very unique as are his lyrics.  He has an eclectic mix of love songs, "we are the world" type songs and a few others on this album.  He has the staying power for long the long term and I would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes.  I loved Streetcorner Symphony!  It is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me.  Lonely No More is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say I am replaying grooves in that one!  Enjoy this album - I sure do
