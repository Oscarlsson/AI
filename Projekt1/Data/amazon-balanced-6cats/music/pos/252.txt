Like many Amazon reviewers, I play a teensy bit of guitar.  I know just enough to know how incredible these guys are.  This is the best, most exciting acoustic playing I've heard since Al DiMeola cut "Race With Devil on Spanish Highway" on his Elegant Gypsy Suite LP.  Watching the Del Castillo brothers shred on the DVD part of this set will assure that I don't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time.  Since Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Spy Kids, etc) filmed the performances, we get appallingly good, tight shots of the fretwork.  People, it can't be done.  I will henceforth concentrate on harmonica, and try to forget that Sugar Blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument.

The songs and playing come from a somewhat traditional Latin, Mexicano perspective, but the overall sound is more like Santana when Carlos goes acoustic.  The "hidden track" on the CD most overtly shows that the Del Castillo brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the Latin roots music.

This is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys Latin music or great guitar work of any style, but it is more accurate to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should check it out.  The quality of music here really transcends the genre
