This was one of my first albums I got. I got it because of 'Paradise City' but got adapted quickly to 'Welcome to the Jungle' and rest. 

There were only few more metal/rock albums that made such impact on my taste during teens: 
Maiden's 'Powerslave',  Megadeth 'Rust in Peace'  and Suicidal Tendencies 'Lights...Camera...revolution'
