I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time.  Right from the first track, I was hooked.  "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album.  "Breathe" has a subdued yet powerful message.  "Home" is just plain fun.  "Song For You" is sweet, somber, and hopeful.

However, I must say that the Four Songs version of "Orange Sky" is what I consider to be the greatest song ever written.  However, the Time Without Consequence version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the original).  The new version is too fast, has an inexplicably irritating percussion, and just doesn't dig into the soul the way the Four Songs version does.  I will always be baffled by this remake.  It is truly awful.  Its only saving grace is that the original is still available.

But that is by no means any reason to avoid this CD.  In fact, those who do not know the original "Orange Sky" may fall in love with this one.  But it is my duty to warn those looking for an "Orange Sky" that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed.  Outside of this single-song complaint, this CD has vaulted to one of the best I own
