EDITED:
It took me a while to enjoy listening to this whole album since I am used to listening to her recent work - Afterglow & Surfacing.  This is truly an outstanding album and definitely overlooked. In my opinion, this ranks as the 3rd best Sarah McLachlan album with #1 Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and #2 Afterglow -- even though Surfacing outsold these 2 albums.

I can't say much about the album, because some of the reviews here say what I would say for this album as well.

Drawn to the Rhythm: 5/5

Into The Fire: 5/5

The Path of Thorns (Terms): 5/5 - first song from Solace I heard. Truly unique than the rest since she sings at a lower range.

I Will Not Forget You: 5+/5 - LOVE IT, My #1 favorite of all her songs on this album.

Lost: 4.5/5 (this is a first for Sarah McLachlan to have male background singers singing - Edited:  actually this would be the third as her 1st album "Touch" had male bg singers for the tracks Trust and Strange World)

Back Door Man: 5/5 - I truly enjoy this song, this song sort of reminds me of Stupid from Afterglow. I love her intense voice and wish she could do more songs like this.

Shelter: 5/5 - really sad and it's actually the second Solace song I heard after 'Path'

Black: 5+/5 - this is my second favorite song.  All in all, deep lyrics dedicated to corporate pigs as Sarah says.  One of her first experimental songs after "Touch".

Home: 5/5 - this is also another good song, probably the 3rd I love.  I just love how the song ends.  It actually sounds better live since the instruments overlap her singing.

Mercy: 5/5 - I consider this the last song from the album. WYLLH doesn't do it for me and I'm disappointed Sarah let Arista have it their way.  Oh well.  Sarah should do more acapella-like songs!  This truly displayed her skills and got even better in the next album ;)

Overall rating: 9.5/10

Outstanding album I wish it had more praise
