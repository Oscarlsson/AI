 This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.
