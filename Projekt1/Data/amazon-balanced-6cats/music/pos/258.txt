Hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like Lady Sovereign. She is not only lyrically impressive, but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving, which is basically what she sets out to do. I dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the UK, but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now. And i will patiently await for S.O.V. debut US album.

Favorite Track, though all of it is really good, will have to be "The Battle" feature other grime scene artists like Shystie, Zuz Rock, and Frost P spitting the wildest (barely understandable lol) rhymes ive heard. No men and women have battled against each other like this, especially for the listening public.

How ever, no one should compare SOV to anyone (Missy or M.I.A.) All emcees, particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such. SOV has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date. It's refreashing to see a new spin on HipHop.
