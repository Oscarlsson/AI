Yes, there may be some small issues with the sound quality, but you get used to it, and Wilhelm Kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th Century, so it is worth it. These are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive. Kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity, whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes. Highly recommended
