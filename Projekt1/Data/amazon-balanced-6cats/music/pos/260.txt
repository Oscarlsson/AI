Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like Sat in Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The Swallow, Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point. There's lots of anger on this album, as Kate put it herself many years ago, and it is her "darkest" effort to date, but it's pure brilliance! Buy it and be convinced.....
