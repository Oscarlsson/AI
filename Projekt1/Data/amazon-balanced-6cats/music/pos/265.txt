I am a big Ambrosia fan and I love "Biggest Part of Me", "You're the Only Woman", "How Much I Feel" and the newer track "I Just Can't Let Go".  However, I wish this CD contained all of their Billboard Hot 100 hits.  The CD is missing their cover of "Magical Mystery Tour" (#39) and "How Can You Love Me" (#86).  For the casual listener, this CD is perfect.  For the chart hit completionists out there, it misses a couple songs.  I bought this CD used for $1.99, which was a HUGE bargain for the songs included.  For that price, I can certainly try to download the missing tracks
