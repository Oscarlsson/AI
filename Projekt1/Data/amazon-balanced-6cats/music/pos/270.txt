If you do not yet own Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here AND The Wall, do not even consider purchasing A Momentary Lapse of Reason. AMLOR is junk by comparison.

That said, very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three, and AMLOR certainly has its bright spots. "Learning to Fly" and "On the Turning Away" are as good as anything Pink Floyd has ever produced. Some of the other songs are adequate, but this album does not contain the front-to-back brillance of the earlier Floyd releases. It's definitely worth having, but make sure that you have the others first.
