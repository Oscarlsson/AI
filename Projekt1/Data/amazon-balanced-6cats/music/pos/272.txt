Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across.  Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good.  I'd recommend it to just about anyone.  My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche.  But I like this disc too
