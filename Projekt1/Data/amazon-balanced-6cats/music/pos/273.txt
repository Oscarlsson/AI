It's impossible to like all of country music, but Randy Travis is liked by even those who don't like country music. From 1986 and through the 90's he was always on top or near the top of the country charts.  His calm, nasal drawl reminds me a bit of Lefty Frizell, but there's no mistaking his unique style. These are some of the best recordings in the history of country music including Digging Up Bones, Forever and Ever, Amen, Too Gone Too Long, Is It Still Over?, Hard Rock Bottom Of Your Heart etc. Randy had 16 No. 1's on the country charts. There are 20 cuts here.  If you only want one CD with all his greatest hits this is your logical choice. By the way, the sound from Rhino is bright and punchy and the booklet features dates, neat pixs, and peak positions. You've got a winner for life with this one!
