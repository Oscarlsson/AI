"Horizon" was a turning point in the recording career of the Carpenters--a more sophisticated sound more suited to Karen's rich and warm voice. But the album was rather short, and some of the songs just weren't up to the standards expected by their fans, which was reflected in the sales of the album, which was their slowest selling album up to that point.

The opening "Aurora" and the closing "Eventide" (The same melody with different lyrics) nicely bookend the album, and Aurora provides the first hint that this was not the average Carpenters album. "Only Yesterday" follows; this beautiful and uptempo song begins as a dolorous, downbeat ballad before segueing into the cheerful refrain. The cover of "Desperado" is well done, but ultimately it is lost between the flashy tracks before and after it. "Please Mr. Postman" is infectuously happy fluff; it has absolutely no depth, but is irresistable while it's playing and will have you singing along with Karen.  The big-band era "I Can Dream, Can't I?" reveals the new depths of Karen's voice, and the small jazz combo  ensures that she is the focus of the listener. The third and final single from this album, "Solitaire" begins the second half of the album on a (metaphorical) high note. The remaining full tracks ("Happy","I'm Caught Between Goodbye and I Love You", and "Love Me for What I Am") are all less-than-captivating songs that greatly benefit from Karen's reading and Richard's arrangements
