I received "Aerial" last December, and it still amazes me.  The music soars and sweeps, carrying the listener along on its wings.  It is a work of genius, and those who are long-time Kate Bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive!  

This two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences, in my opinion.  The first disc, "A Sea of Honey" is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces, first of which is "King of the Mountain," probably the most "commercially appealing" song on the album.  "King of the Mountain" sucks the listener in with deep, murky tones and Kate's voice easing into the song softly, building in intensity as the song progresses.  "King of the Mountain" is followed by songs like "Pi" (who else but Kate Bush could make the derivation of Pi sound so sexy?) and "Bertie," a lovely Elizabethan paean to her young son.  Then there are emotionally raw songs like "Mrs. Bartolozzi" and "A Coral Room," the latter of which is about Kate's late Mother.  The reclusive Ms. Bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in "How to Be Invisible," and sings in reference to Joan of Arc in "Joanni."

After being captivated by songs about famous people, and more down-to-earth personal struggles/triumphs, the listener comes to the second disc, titled "A Sky of Honey."  This is, in my opinion, the pi�ce de r�sistance of "Aerial."  This disc is a continuous journey of sound, taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by--among other things--the sounds of birds, the sound of her child's voice, and Kate Bush's silky voice singing in Italian.  The disc is almost indescribably beautiful, in my opinion.  I love the way "A Sky of Honey" takes me out of myself when I hear it.  I feel like I am flying at points; becoming one with the soaring birds.  My personal favorite on "A Sky of Honey" is "Nocturn," a surreal nighttime romp on the beach, accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of Kate Bush's voice.  The disc's final (and title) track "Aerial" is a forceful climax to the sonic journey, and ends with Bush singing:

"I want to be up on the roof
I've gotta be up on the roof
Up, up high on the roof
Up, up on the roof
In the sun"

It is as though Kate Bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip.  What an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is!

To Kate Bush fans, I cannot recommend this album highly enough.  True, it was a very long wait for this new CD, but, Ms. Bush has rewarded her fans duly; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph!  If you are a Kate Bush devotee, you will not be disappointed!  And, if you are new to Kate Bush, "Aerial" will be a great introduction to her genius.  Kate Bush is like no other artist I can name.  Her voice is incredibly versatile; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee, a temptress or a child.  And, so far in her career, it Kate Bush's voice gets better with the passing of time.  Like a fine wine, one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly.  "Aerial" is well, well worth listening to, and words alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is.
