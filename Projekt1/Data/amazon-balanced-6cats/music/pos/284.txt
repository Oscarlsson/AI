This is where AFI began their sound change from their first 2 cd's (answer that & stay fashionable, Very Proud of Ya). It is much more serious than the first 2, alot angrier, heavier, Darker, and more screaming/yelling as well. Some people say this is their best, I disagree, I prefer their "punkier" 1st 2 BUT i still enjoy this alot, it's all down to personal taste, it gets a 5/5 for me
