I have just about all of Robben's albums and I believe that this is his best work. The interpretations and musicianship are outstanding. Robben's improvisational playing actually comes across more like  composition. His  technique is extremely melodic. He is, in my opinion, one the best blues  guitar players around and his profound knowledge of jazz gives his music a  very refreshing &quot;twist&quot;. Check out his prowess on &quot;You cut  me to the bone&quot;, &quot;Prison of love&quot; or &quot;My love will  never die&quot;
