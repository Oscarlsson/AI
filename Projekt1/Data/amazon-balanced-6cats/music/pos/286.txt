Although I like this album, there's nothing that especially stands out about it. It's typical Bright Eyes, and if you already love the band you won't be disappointed. However, it's not one of their best albums. It's not as good as Lifted, not as addicting as Fevers and Mirrors, and not as raw and endearing as Letting off the Happiness. But yet again, Conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a Dashboard Confessional sort of way
