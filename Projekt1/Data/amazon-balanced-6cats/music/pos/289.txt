This album is great but I'm looking for a song that I think they sung. It goes: Pressing on we're pressing on (repeat). Waiting on Jesus to answer our call we're holding on (repeat) Pressing, pressing, pressing. If anyone knows the name of the song, or has any suggestions on who sings this song, please email me at udeebear1984@yahoo.com. Thank you and have a blessed day! :
