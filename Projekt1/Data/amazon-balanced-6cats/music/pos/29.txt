This CD is a confusing mix of punk bands, from pop-punk's Sum 41 &amp; Good Charlotte to punk favorites Alkaline Trio, Vandetta Red, &amp; The Casualties to bands that I've never even heard of such as Unsung Zeros, Ozma, &amp; Destruction Made Simple.  I reccomend this CD if you're looking for new bands to like &amp; listen to.  Although it's a confusing CD, it gives you new ideas of just how deep you're going to go in the punk underground
