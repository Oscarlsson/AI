I'm a fan of Three 6 Mafia, and I can say maybe they kinda got a little of Three 6's rap style in this album, but I dunno.

DJ Paul and Juicy J, the superproducers, they can never be beaten. I got all the Hypnotize Minds albums and they did invent crunk music. Many people haven't heard of them cuz besides Ridin' Spinners and Chickenhead they haven't been played on the radio very much except for their new track "Poppin' My Collar."

Crime Mob's alright. The beats are alright, but nothing compared to Three 6 Mafia. Some of them are some krunk songs, I can get hyped to a few of them. But other than that I dunno. The lyrics are rather simple, I'm an 18 year old white dude and I think I can put together some better bars than these dudes can.

But they do get some major play up here in Virginia. Stilletos and Knuck if you Buck haven't gotten some airtime. But there's only like 4 songs total that are worth hearing. I guess we'll see if they put out another album or not. I think if they had some other fellas from Georgia like T.I. or Jeezy or something they might get some more hype. Who knows, since Paul Wall's on every song now maybe he'll make a cameo. I guess we'll see.

Three 6 Mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist Chrome, who really is garbage, they are still the kings of crunk, not Lil' John
