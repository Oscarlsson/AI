if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly mayby. Tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;V.I.C.E&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have
