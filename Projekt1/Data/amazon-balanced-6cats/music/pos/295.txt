The earlier reviews pretty much said it all; this is pretty much one of THE best and most overlooked bands from the 90s.  Swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often, however, if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band, because they aren't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock.  Yes, rock.  Who knew it could still be done, and believe me, they do it well, and uniquely.  If you've listened to Swervedriver before, then tehre isn't too much more to say - buy this album.  It's not as hi-fi as 99th Dream or Mezcal Head (in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade), but not as fast or dirty as Raise.  Now, if you have never listened to Swervedriver, this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes.  Personally, I would suggest starting with 99th Dream or Mezcal Head; either way, this has all the qualities of every Swervedriver album - great lyrics, superb and unique songs, and that urge for more when it's over.  Sadly, this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together (however, some vestiges exist in the form of Toshack Highway).  But if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so, if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - Swervedriver is a must
