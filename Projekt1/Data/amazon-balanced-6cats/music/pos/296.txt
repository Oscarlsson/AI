Every thing he sings is perfect, I've yet to find one song that doesn't move me.  This CD has some beauties.  &quot;Daughter of Mine&quot; is priceless.  &quot;Steal Away&quot; is very nice.  &quot;One Small  Star&quot; brings tears.  This arrangement of &quot;Voyage&quot; is  probably the best I've heard.  His traditional songs (&quot;When you and I  were young Maggie&quot; and &quot;Mary of Argyle&quot;) are beautiful.  I  can't find anything on this CD I couldn't listen to for hours.  I truly  love music and listen to it constantly.  I find myself reaching for the  McDermott CD's almost exclusively.  I have them all, more please
