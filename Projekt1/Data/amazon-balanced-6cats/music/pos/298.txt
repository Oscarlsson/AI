I'm only giving this 5 stars because the actual recordings are priceless. However I'm telling you now. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM

This is stolen goods and the recordings that are on this cd are not even of the finest quality.

This is purely a commercial album released by the record company without the permission of Jack Off Jill's members. And thus they recieve no royalties for the selling of this album.


Fear not though. you can get the tracks off this album completely free and in better quality. 

Agent Moulder of Jack Off Jill has remastered and released them on her website for your downloading pleasure. 

you can find them here:

t-c-r.net/jojmusic 

while you are there check out and support her new band TCR, and their new album 'The Chrome Recordings'.

Singer Jessicka also has an amazing new band if you didn't already know. check her and Scarling. out at scarling.com 


God Bless Jack Off Jill.
