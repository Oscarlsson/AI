this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an Atreyu Album. It dies today rip off the former bands style, but they are still a very good band.  In the over-crowded metalcore market of today, that is a rarity.  My only complaint, is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice (as heard on "The Radiance), but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music. still 5/5 material though.
Favorite songs: "The Radiance," "Freak Gasoline Fight," "Our Disintigration," and :THe Caitliff Choir:Defeatism
