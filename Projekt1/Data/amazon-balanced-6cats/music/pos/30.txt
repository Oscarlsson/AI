 I would say that this is the closest that Cheap Trick ever got to making a perfect album. There are only two songs on here that I'm not one hundred percent crazy about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' On the Radio ', which I think kisses up to radio D.J.'s too much. I love the rest of this.

This album was my introduction to Cheap Trick and I would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to them. ' Surrender ' is an out and out classic and possibly my favorite Cheap Trick song of all time. Like most of the rest of the album, it's heavy, it's catchy, has great singing and interesting lyrics, and it says all it has to say in three to five minutes. ' Auf Weidersehen ' is another favorite tune of mine...it may be one of the heaviest tunes C.T. has ever done. I particularly love Bun E.'s energetic drumming on it. Zander really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune! Another great hard rocker is 'Stiff Competition'.

Of the more pop oriented songs, I would say ' Taking Me Back ' is another personal favorite of mine. Probably should have been a hit, dang it! ' How Are You ' shows off the band's terrific sense of humor...I particularly like the reference to one of their earlier songs! The other tunes from the first half that I didn't mention are also terrific, particularly ' On Top Of The World '.

My only complaint about this newly remastered version is that it doesn't include the lyrics, which WERE included on the original LP version. That is but a minor complaint. I don't think Cheap Trick ever made another album quite as great as this one.
