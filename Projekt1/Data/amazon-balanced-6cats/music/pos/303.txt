This guy is going to become big someday.    I agree with this reviewer: 

"The songs on "Seven Swans", with a folksy bucholic feeling that runs through most of them, tell of spiritual tales. They tell of love that transcends the body and age. Sufjan can appeal equally to the Christian person as to the one who practices Zen Buddhism. And that is something few songwriters can accomplish. Keep an eye on Sufjan for years to come."  I have fun tooling around with "To Be Alone with You" on the guitar, such a simple but infectious melody.  

"SEVEN SWANS" is not over orchestrated like "Michigan" and "Illinois" seem to be.  Good song to OK song ratio is about 85 percent on this one and about 45-50 percent on the the aforementioned CD's.    "SEVEN SWANS" is a great way to get introduced to the subtle musical power and overall genius of Sufjan.  

Sufjan has all his own style and is not afraid to tell us who he is.  VERY CREATIVE...HE TRULY FORGES HIS OWN MUSICAL PATH.  CANNOT WAIT FOR HIS CD CALLED "WISCONSIN."
