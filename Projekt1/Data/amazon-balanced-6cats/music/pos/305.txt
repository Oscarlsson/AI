I INHALED this CD.  After all the hype and hyper blowin' up about this dance/punk/rock genius, I finally broke down and bought it.  Not that I was old enough to get into the discos in the mid 70's-early/mid 80's(I was still in elementary school, then middle school), but I remember(and still love) the groups that influenced this disc...The Buzzcocks, Heaven 17, PiL, Blondie...hell even the Rolling Stones "Some Girls" album.  And yes, I have to say(after finding "Death Disco-Songs Under the Dance Floor 1978-1984" CD and I'm ordering it)the old stuff is more fun.  But for the hipsters who don't know this is not original genre,it's pretty great.  No, it's very great.  The first song "Daft Punk is Playing at my House" was fun, and both discs made it worth driving through  snowy/sleety/frozen rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple weeks
