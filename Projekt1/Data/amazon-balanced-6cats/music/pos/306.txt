With a compelling story, great music, great lyrics, and two outstanding female leads, Aida certainly delievers. Right from the start with the goregous "Every Story Is A Love Story", the listener is captured by the wonderful spirit of the show. The seamless tranisition between ballads and showtunes is flawless.

The three stars of the show each being something different to this recording. While Adam Pascal is always great, he's the weak point on this recording. I much more prefer him in Rent, and I don't think his voice suits this show very well. Sherie Renee Scott is teriffic as Amneris, and her powerful voice fills this recording with the powerful opener and "I Know the Truth". The star, however, is Heather Headley as Aida. Her Tony-winning performance will be forever immortalized on this recording with big, raw, emotional, and powerful voice. She's is perfect in every way
