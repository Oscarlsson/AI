This was one of those rare performances where Dylan's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and great. The sound is rough, the intonation is off, the recording is filled with horrible buzzes, whistles, and clicks. None of which matters. Once youe listened to some of the tracks on this disk, you'll prefer them to the original album cuts. I know I do. Absolutely essential to any collection of Dylan's work, "Hard Rain" is not to be missed.
