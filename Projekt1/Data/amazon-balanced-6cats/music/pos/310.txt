I purchased this album from Rasputina's website as soon as it was released there, and it stayed in my cd player (or technically, it stayed on repeat on my iPod) for a full fortnight after. It's full of the rock, groove, beauty, and madness that typefies the live Raspy experience.

I HIGHLY recommend this cd to any fans who love to see the band live in recital, or who have not yet had the pleasure. If you don't have this recording, buy it now! Wait a minute... why don't you have it yet?

The only reason I've given a rating of 4, rather than 5, is that I feel the sound quality could be a tad better in some spots; it can get a little murky. But for the most part, it sounds pretty good.

I'll also mention, for anyone who doesn't know, that Zoe's latest solo cd is now available on her website, zoekeating.com. She's a wonderful artist in her own right - check it out!
