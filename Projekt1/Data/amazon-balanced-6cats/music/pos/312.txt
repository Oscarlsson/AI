For any seasoned fans of The Waifs (or anyone out there with a predilection for folksy girl duets sporting brilliant guitar skills and voices to boot), 'Shelter Me' will be no departure --and no disapointment -- from what you've heard before. The album weighs heavily on The Waifs accoustical appeal. The majority of the songs carry themselves without backbeat or excessive instrumentation -- mostly it's just the girls, their guitars, and the usual, typically wonderful songwriting that comes from Josh Cunningham, the third member of this stellar folk ensemble. The title track 'Shelter Me' is a gorgeous, magnificently charged piece that will leave you reeling, "Take me now where shelter be/ before there's nothing left of me." Vikki's final track 'Spotlight' is a pure gem, emotional and raw but utterly beautiful. 'Attention' finishes the album well with that familliar Waify energy and pulse, almost blue grass, almost country, but totally wonderful.
