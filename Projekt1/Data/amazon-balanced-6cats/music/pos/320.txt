This album was so good to hear when it came out. I like every song on here but my favorites are "Still Dre","The Watcher","Xxplosive","What's The Difference" and "Forget About Dre. Those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like. Recommend this album highly to rap fans. Buy this album you have nothing to loose because its Dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic
