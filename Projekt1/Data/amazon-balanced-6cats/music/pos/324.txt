O.G. Ron C did a good job Screwin' & Choopin'. He really gave the rest of tha U.S. a taste of Texas (Tha Lone Star State). Tha best time to listen to any screwed & chopped music [SwishaHouse, Chamillitary, D.S.R.(Dirty South Rydaz)] is you are throwed (drunk) off that syrup. This was a good thing that O.G. Ron C did, Choppin' Boyz Up & Not Sloppin' Boyz Up. CHAMILLITARY MAN!!
