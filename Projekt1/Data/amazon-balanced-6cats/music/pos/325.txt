Oh! Boy! how things have change..years ago i invested thousands of dollars in a killer Dvd-audio/Super-audio multichannel surround System.This was done to capture the glory of the state of the art music mastered in the wide frequency response of 24/192kHz.Example ..Donald Fagen "Morph The Cat" dvd-audio disc..this dics captures the dedicated genuine glory of dvd-audio multichannel done superbly.Today we have the so call Bonus Dvd Audio disc packaged together for one low rediculous price only to be disappointed  with the amature quality of the 5.1 mix.If you are an audiophile like me and know the difference between the dedicated Dvd-audio disc sold between $14.99-$29.99 and the so call Bonus Dvd Disc...you will understand why iam so irritated at this new phenomenon.Today most good recievers can play back stereo recorded music in "all channel Stereo/multichannel stereo surround which sounds superior to the so call DVD 5.1 disc.The stereo version of the Beatles LOVE album is worthy of my expensive system and is highly recommended
