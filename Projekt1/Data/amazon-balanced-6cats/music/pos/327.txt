I love this Pretenders album and Chrissie always rocks but I love the songwriting skill of Billy Steinberg & Tom Kelley.  They wrote "Love Colours", "Night in my Veins" and the hit "Stand by You".  Her follow-up to this, "VIVA! EL AMOR!" also contains three tracks written by them.  I purchased this long after its release and was glad I did.  Steinberg Kelley write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord changes.  Something not all big names can do on their own and Chrissie wisely is aware of this.
