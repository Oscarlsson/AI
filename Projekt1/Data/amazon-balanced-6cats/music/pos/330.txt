Feinstein is in love with the Gershwins and that passion is never made clearer than in Pure Gershwin.  Michael's love affair with Ira's lyrics, his reckless abandon to the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and  lesser known --phrases, more than makes up for the less polished vocal  production in this early album.  In fact, it is that very element that  sells these songs as I've never heard them elsewhere.  Michael pulls out  all stops, embracing the less-than-lily-white additional verses of  &quot;Embraceable You&quot;, with the unbridled passion of a first time  lover.  His duet with Rosie Clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie  in which this unknown number made its debut.  What a delightful approach  Michael demonstrates throughout....  Oh, to be that young and exuberant  about life, love and music again
