If you would have told me last year that I would own an album of piano solos I probably would have laughed in your face. While I enjoy several kinds of music, most of my favorites are in the classic rock and alternative genres. The reason I bought this is my wife and I are having a baby in December and our birthing class instructor played and reccomended Brickman as a popular choice for relaxation music and her personal favorite. I bought &quot;No Words&quot; and &quot;Simple Things&quot; mainly for their absence of singing and something to play while she is in labor. I have been listening to them nearly every night since we received them while browsing the internet or doing chores around the house. It really is amazing music that is very calming and relaxing. He definitely pours everything he has into his piano and the accompanying instruments and background is fabulous. Everything everyone else has stated in their reviews is right on as well. I would definitely reccomend not only this CD but Jim Brickman in general if you are looking for a nice relaxing getaway
