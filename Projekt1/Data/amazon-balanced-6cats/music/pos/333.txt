this is without doubt the most beautiful, moving song i have ever heard.  i cry every time i listen to it.  i will ask my family to have it played at my funeral.  the lyrics and symbolism are born of emotional genius.  the solo vocalist and the instrumentation are flawless.  this selection is the hope diamond of contemporary music
