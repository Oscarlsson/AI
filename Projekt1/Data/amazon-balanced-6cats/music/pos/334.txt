this album is a great representation of what spoon is about. great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one's ears. spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well. they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting. some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind, the two sides of monsieur valentine, sister jack and i turn my camera on. i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock. definately money well spent
