The sounds were very convincing, I actually felt like I was there even my daughter thought it was really storming outside since I have a Subwoofer and was able to control the thunder intensity (all this was at night) the only thing missing was the strobe light to add to the lightnig effect. It does relax you and allows you to destress. There are other types of stress management cd's out there but if you like the outdoors and your'e not able to get away then this is what may work for you.
