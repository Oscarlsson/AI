This album is absolutely fantastic! Paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together. Paul sounds very loose and like he's having a lot of fun - not as serious as some live shows I've heard.

The songs focus mostly on his solo records, with some Jam and Style Council mixed in (all on disc two). Wisely, only five of the twenty three tracks are from "As Is Now" and they're the uptempo ones - it's not a hard sell by Yep Roc to make you buy that album if you don't already have it.

The extended jams for "Porcelain Gods/Broken Stones," "In The Crowd" and "Foot Of The Mountain" (one of my favorite solo tracks) all are focused and don't wander so they keep your attention. The crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the Jam and Style Council classics get into the mix (although the sing-along to the album closing "Town Called Malice" is pretty lame).

I haven't listened to the somewhat difficult to find "Live Wood" concert disc for a while to give a good comparison. However, since "Catch-Flame" covers all his solo discs instead of only "Paul Weller" and "Wild Wood," this is a more balanced collection. Highly recommended!
