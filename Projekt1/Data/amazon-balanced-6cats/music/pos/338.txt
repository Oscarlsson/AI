But a good debut album. This is when I felt proud knowin Ja was from ny. No radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part. But i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you can't keep talkin about it, which is why i guess he changed his style. Now the subject i wanna hit. Has anyone noticed that guy named progressive? Why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture? And everytime I turn around its some damn rocker/junkie hippie. Last time i checked Rhythm and melody was part of music. I dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock. I'm tired of our music bein trashed. You know what im a go trash one of they "artist" right now
