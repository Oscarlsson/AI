This album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings.  Sheryl Crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history.  Sheryl shines on her own, singing some of her great hits, but it's the duets that really make the album.  My least favorite has to be the Dixie Chicks just because I can't appreciate the country flare they bring to "Strong Enough" but it's still a great version.  Chrissie Hynde, one of the album's highlights, brings intense attitude to "If It Makes You Happy", still one of my favorite Sheryl songs.  Stevie Nicks remains Stevie Nicks, giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own "Gold Dust Woman."  Sarah McLachlan's usually soft voice comes out strong on "The Difficult Kind" and compliments Sheryl's quite nicely.  My favorite rendition has to be Eric Clapton and Sheryl together on Cream's "White Room", the rock-out moment on the album.  The show is complete when all the guests return to belt out Bob Dylan's "Tombstone Blues" and close the show with a definite BANG
