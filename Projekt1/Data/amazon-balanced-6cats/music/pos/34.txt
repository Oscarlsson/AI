 I picked this up in a bootleg store in Korea a few years back, since it was cheap, and I had loved the movie (perhaps more so than any other of Mallicks's others, even - speaking of which, if you get a chance to see Badlands on the big screen, do yourself a huge favour and do so).

 As I recall, I didn't really enjoy it on first listen. But then, somehow, I got sucked in. Almost as much as the film itself, this is a hypnotic, haunting slice of poetry. Nothing happens for about a minute, and then it builds and builds. 

Unforgettable, otherwordly and quite beguiling. 

 The structure of the soundtrack (especially the songs toward the end featuring Polynesian gospel-style singing) is strongly reminiscent of the Mike Oldfield cd, 'Songs of Distant Earth'. Highly recommended, but do give it a couple of listens, because it might take a while to make its charms felt
