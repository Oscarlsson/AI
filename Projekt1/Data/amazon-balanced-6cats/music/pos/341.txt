First of all Bob Dylan is certainly not for everyone. However, if his style is up your alley this is a classic. You can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like "lay lady lay" or "like a rolling stone" to name a couple. Planet Waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully. This is probably my favorite Dylan album and I have all the "classics" like Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 revisited. ect. I'd recommend this to any Dylan fan
