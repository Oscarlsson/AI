It is good for old Eric Gale fans to be able to purchase this
cd. It will bring back many memories. It will also remind you 
of how great a guitar player he was. I am grateful that I've 
had a chance to own many recordings that he has played on. Pay
close attention to She is my lady and morning glory. This is a 
must have cd.        jaye price
