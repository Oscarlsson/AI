I have seen Phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording.  It is a different approach to the classic Leroux novel; one that is gentler and more romantic, but still intense and passionate.  The lyrics and music are excellent.
Even if you are an ALW/PTO fan, don't miss this production if it plays nearby.
