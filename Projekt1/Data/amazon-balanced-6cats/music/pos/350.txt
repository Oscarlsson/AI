There is a reason why Styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row!  Find out why. They are a unique band, with their own uncatagorizable style and sound.  Not hard rock, but can rock. Not pop, but catchy melodies and great three part harmony.  Not art rock, but themed concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and crescendos in their music.  It is probably true that Lady was the first power ballad, though Styx was not credited for it.  Lady paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer sides.   Perhaps Styx was not always successful in their attempts, but they took chances artistically and musically and should be given props for doing so.  Every song on this CD is great; however the two that stand out for me are Too Much Time On My Hands and Suite Madame Blue.  Most people who have spent time in neighborhood bar will would likely agree that Too Much Time On My Hands is witty, funny, and true.   Suite Madame Blue a song which is a metaphor for the United States is simply One of the Greatest Rock Songs Ever!! The lyrics of Suite Madame Blue are as powerful as the music, and this song contains all the elements which made Styx great
