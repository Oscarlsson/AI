this is quite a sharp turn from francine's previous album (40 on a fall day)... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble's work in poundcake, this time around it's quieter, subtler, sweeter and sadder. make no mistake, this is a break-up album. even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold, lonely, hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can.

the mood will draw you in and keep you listening, but after a few listens it's the songs you'll fall in love with. ahh, the songs. they're densely packed with chord changes, odd but appealing lyrics, and unexpected instrumentation. they're hooky without being obvious (a francine specialty). this was my favourite album of 2003, and i still listen to it pretty often these days.

best tracks: this sunday's revival, silver plated 606, novelty, 13 years.
best lyric: "read a year old mail / now you should've told me / i've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly
