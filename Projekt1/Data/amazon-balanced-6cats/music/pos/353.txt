I'm biased, because I loved the movie and adore the book.  

Gregson-Williams does an outstanding job here (before this, I was most familiar with his score work on Metal Gear Solid videogames).  

The music is extremely touching and magical.  The "Evacuating London Score" (from the scene in the train station) tugs at the heartstrings.  And the "Battle Score" brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie's climax.  One song that's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek.  Other than that absence (probably due to copyright restrictions), this is an excellent CD.  

As for the "Bonus" DVD - I probably wouldn't purchase it if I had a second chance.  It's got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art.  There is only one trailer, and it is not the very first one released, which opens with the kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin' with its intro of the wardrobe.  There are also behind-the-scenes interviews I haven't watched yet, but I wonder if they'll appear again when the movie DVD is released.
