I saw Midlake at festival recently and had never heard of them. The live set was strong enough to convince me to order some albums and I'm now a solid fan. The opening track, Roscoe, reminds me a bit of Adrian Belew, a bit of XTC and a whole lot of Midlake themselves. It's like suddenly realizing how Coldplay should sound. The music is layered and atmospheric with a bit of an eels feel. Midlake is definitely their own band, for all the influences I'm throwing out. They make the sort of music that feels old, like your favorite album you lost long ago. Try 'Roscoe' or 'Young Bride' for an indication of their style. If you like either of those, you need to buy the album.
