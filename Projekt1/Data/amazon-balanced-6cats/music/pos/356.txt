Everyone has their favorite Beatle. Some people love to complain about Paul's solo music, comparing it to John's. The fact is that each of the Beatles had their own style, and together they had a magical symbiosis. Separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew. 

So Paul's music is light hearted? Maybe even silly? Sure, but if you are like me and enjoy each Beatle for what they brought to the group, then this is a wonderful album. No you won't find deep soul searching here, just fun! And fun is what this album has in abundance. 

So if you want to curse Paul for his naivet, don't buy this album. If you loved the Beatles, and enjoyed each one for their individual talent, this is a fun solo album. 

In my humble opinion it is Paul's best solo album, as he really spreads his "Wings" and you can hear the sense of freedom coming through loud and clear. Later albums seem to become too engineered, and never seem to have the same energy that this album has.
