I rarely write reviews, but I need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is.  I have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old, and this CD is in heavy rotation at our house.  My husband and I love the music at least as much as they do -- it's stylish and sets a great mood as we're making dinner and doing dishes.  The kids love it too, needless to say.  My four-year-old's favorites are Three Blind Mice (she loves when the farmer's wife squeaks that she'll give back the tails) and the final track by Peggy Lee (where she says the word *poop*, as in "party poop" -- endless laughter ensues).  Ella Fitzgerald's A-Tisket, A-Tasket and Chew, Chew Your Bubblegum are priceless.  All in all, I highly recommend this CD -- everyone will be happy to hear it again and again
