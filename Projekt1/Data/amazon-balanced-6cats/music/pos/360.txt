Pinback BLOWS me away.  I consider my taste in music to be very diverse, with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop, from the last three decades (talk talk, split enz to elliot smith and death cab).  Pinback delivers some of the best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS.  I started with Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen Life has about knocked the breath right out of me.  I haven't gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop listening to the three albums I have in my hands.  Words cannot express how fascinating this band is - intricate & complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery.  Their transitions are SICK.  They put their contemporaries (death cab, the shins, the killers) to SHAME.  I love all of the aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back, over & over.  How many albums can you say that about?  They are heavenly.  The standouts are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw it - every song is GREAT!
