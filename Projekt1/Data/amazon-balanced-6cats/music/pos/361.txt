Sam Moore's new CD is a welcome return to the roots of soul.  This CD has got IT!  Sam's voice is superb and the duets he does with his guests are wonderful.  I'm not a fan of country music so I was a bit fearful of what Wynona and Travis Tritt would do with Sam.  Wow!  Are they ever good!  Wynona's got it.  I'm going to listen to more of her now.  
The musicians are the best!  I thought I could hear that wonderful touch of Earth Wind and Fire on some of the numbers so I went searching the notes.  Sure enough--there is Reggie Young--the wonderful Earth Wind and Fire trombonist!  Go Reggie!  
Billy Preston is wonderful on "You are So Beautiful" as is the accompanying guitar by Eric Clapton.  This is a musician's CD--quality all the way.
I have had the great pleasure of seeing Sam Moore and Billy Preston  in person (with Bowzer's Doo Wop Party--thank god for Bowzer, bringing back all these wonderful artists) and they were wonderful.  I'd love to see even more of Sam Moore.  Thanks to Randy Jackson for putting this together.  This is a class-act.
