I have a few hundred surf CDs and I would have to say thet this CD is my favorite! My next favorite is their new CD called "Headin' Out". They have the reverb and the composition that just makes all of the songs fantastic. If you like instrumental surf you will love this CD! Buy it you won't be sorry
