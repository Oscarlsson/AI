NWA was an original rap group and with that being said, this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers. Along with Public Enemy, NWA christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. Although I don't agree with some of their lyrics, one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life. Anyways, buy this album, I recommend it. Keep it away from the kiddies though
