Of course, no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that Dizzy could.  His trumpet can only be described as HOT, and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air.   This man's music has LIFE in it. Unfortunately, the REAL energy to Dizzy is in his Latin Jazz work, and a more complete compilation of that style would be the Compact Jazz series. Ken Burns' collection here is more versatile, but just not as lively as Dizzy's music can be.  Proceed with caution
