While not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as Coldplay, Keane, and Pete Yorn, Travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound. This, their 2nd album, is the best of their music: melodic throughout, with catchy tunes, solid lyrics, and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'Sing' to the fade-out from 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song'.

If you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent, then I confidently recommend The Invisible Band to you. 

Rating each song individually for one's ipod: 
1. Sing, Side, The Cage, Afterglow and the Humpty Dumpty Love Song are each worthy of four to five stars
2. Pipe Dreams, Flowers in the Window, Safe, Follow the Light, and Indefinitely are three to four star songs
3. The balance are two to three stars each. The only poor effort is probably "Last Train", which is too plodding relative to its counterparts

The Invisible Band is basically a healthy mix of folksy, hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy. Nowhere is this better reflected than in 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song', which defines this mix perfectly. While this is the best of the album, the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly.  Highly recommended
