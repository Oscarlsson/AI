Comparing Gogol Bordello and JUF is like comparing apples and oranges. I have seen Gogol live more times than I have fingers and toes to count on. When I bought JUF I did not expect to hear anything remotely resembling a Gogol album. This is a dancehall album. You like it or you don't, but just remember it is a side project. It does not make any sense to compare it to other Gogol albums.
