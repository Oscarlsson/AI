Great compilation of songs from Massive Attack, all of their singles plus new never release songs. The videos are great and their new single 'live with me' is a great song (very sad video though). Includes new version/remix of 'I want you' with madonna. The combo is great you can own ALL of the videos, is a lot of fun to see the videos from blue lines until 100th window from the 90s all the way to the new single, the changes in the way they used to make music videos. There's even the first video with Tricky). 

A must have for any massive attach fan, and if you never heard from this band, you get the best of the best with this cds/dvd. Massive Attack is a band that had influenced a lot of artist from Bjork, Tricky, Madonna, Morcheeba, Portishead, UNKLE, etc.
