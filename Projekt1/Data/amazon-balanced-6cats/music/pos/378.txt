I supposed I should not have been watching this movie when I was nine years old, but I remember seeing it several times via HBO. More importantly, my father bought the soundtrack and we used to listen to it over & over in the car. The songs stuck with me for years, and every know and then I'll hear something out of context and I'll be taken back to roadtrips with my family.  It's something that I won't think about for ages, but when I'm reminded of it, I can't believe I don't still have a copy of the soundtrack. 

I remember it had quiet and comforting songs mixed in with songs you could sing along too. It's perfect for driving and just having on in the background
