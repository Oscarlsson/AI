This soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film--Cater Burwells score is a pitch-perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display,with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly.Also an added bonus of the above-mentioned dream combination--Bartok's &quot;Allegro&quot;(I know diddly about classical music,but Bartok rocks!!),and a typically great Bjork song&quot;Amphibian&quot;(in two versions),that book-ends the album with an etherial,dream-like haze
