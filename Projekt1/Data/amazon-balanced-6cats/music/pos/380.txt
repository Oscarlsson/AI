I would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. This album plain rocks,  It should be known as these guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and annihilator went on tour.  I have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same!
