The progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from Poland. These guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years. So what do we get for our money you ask, a band comprising of well-schooled musicians, incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song. There are a few scatterings of influences that aren't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album, namely Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Genesis and Anathema.

The vocals are clean without a trace of an accent,however they get getting slightly gruff in places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music.  The guitar work is outstanding and David Gilmour from Pink Floyd is a strong reference point here. The rhythm section is outstanding; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering. If you want to start 2007 on a good note then Riverside is a worthy investment for sure.
