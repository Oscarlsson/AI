There are plenty of reasons to get this Dead Album.  One is the fact that this is probably the best recorded Psychedelic CD of all time.  It was the first Rock album recorded on a 16 track.  In fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology.  The remaster is splendid.   Another good reason is the great bonus tracks.  Almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your SUV to the record store.  Can you dig it
