This remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's prepared backrounds on "What's Become Of The Baby", the extra drums and barbershop vocal on "Doin That Rag". St Stephen lost something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great
