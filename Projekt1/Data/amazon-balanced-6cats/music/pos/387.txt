This album is simply one of the coolest things around, and when I listened to it, it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place' kind of method. What this basically is, are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly Indian/Middle Eastern/Oriental festivals; they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice. You get Indian gamelan, mussette accordion, vocal choruses, foreign tongue talking, and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track, and then some. It's very trippy, and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason. Get this for your own good
