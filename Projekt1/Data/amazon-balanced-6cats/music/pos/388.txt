Back in the 70's and 80's, I listened to a really great radio station, WSGS in Hazard, Kentucky. From my home in Flat Gap, Virginia, and anywhere in the region, it was well known that if you wanted real country music, you simply had to turn on WSGS. 100,000 watts of pure, monophonic country music. I'm not talking about the big hats of Nashville, or the gussied up ladies who pose as country singers these days. No, it was the real thing, including local and regional bluegrass, gospel, hiccup preachers, Loretta Lynn, Lefty Frizzel, Merle Haggard, Bill Monroe, Grandpa Jones, and countless others.
    When I listen to this Pattly Loveless release, I think she must have been listening too. It sounds just like the typical afternoon group of selections on old WSGS. Only better, because Patty is from our time, and seems to have that old time, mountain shout-it-out style much like many of those who came before. She reminds me a bit of Wilma Lee Cooper. What a voice!
    If you have never heard of these early country artists, and you like the way Patty does it up here, it would be good to go back and see where she learned all this great music from. This is the real thing
