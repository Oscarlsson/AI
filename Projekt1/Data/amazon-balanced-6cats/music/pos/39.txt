It's been a while since someone has sang the praises of this album.  This is a timeless work.  It never gets old no matter how many times it is played.  I've had this album for 5-6 years and I pull it out every summer.  Great music for boating or BBQ's on the deck.  I promise you will love it.  Something everyone should have in their collection
