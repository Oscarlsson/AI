For anyone who loves trumpet music as I do, this album is a must.  Wynton Marsalis has mastered twenty all-time favorite pieces with such brilliance, that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison.  Opening with J. Clarke's, The King's March, Wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as Purcell's Entrada from "The Indian Queen," J. Clark's The Prince of Denmark's March and J. Stanley's Trumpet Voluntary.  Fantastic selections from Bach, Mozart, and Haydn follow, with the album also including such delightful listening as The Last Rose of Summer, Carnival of Venisee, and Flight of the Bumblebee.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase
