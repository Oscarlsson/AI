This album gives me goosebumps.  I got it because of Eric Dolphy, but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than Eric Dolphy alone (though he's excellent as usual).  The inclusion of Booker Ervin gives the album the perfect texture, as his style in many ways contradicts that of Dolphy. Although the styles are different, they complement each other perfectly.  Mal Waldron is a great composer, and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album.  The song "Thirteen" is a fine example...you'll just have to listen to it.  Everyone on this album smokes.  Get this...you wont regret it
