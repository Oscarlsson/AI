If you liked the original Clerks soundtrack, then you're sure to love this.  Thirteen years after we heard Randall and Dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first Clerks soundtrack, now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is, in fact, the REAL trilogy.  And we, the Clerks fans, get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track.

Oh, and did I mention the music?  Terrific!  Kevin Smith's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie.  It's not too difficult to imagine that Kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time.  In typical Kevin Smith fashion, the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises.  You've got your typical Soul Asylum and Alanis Morrisette as well as King Diamond and an unexpected Jackson 5 dance number.  

If you have not seen the movie, please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack.  Doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them.  Overall, a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any Clerks fan.
