I recently discovered Joyce Cooling. Yeah, I've been in the dark ages. She is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else. I especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations. She's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot. You can hear it all in her music. Buy Revolving Door! You'll love it
