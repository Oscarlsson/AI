Good old silly, irreverent Slade never really caught on in the US, but their melodic early-70s glam rock sounds as energetic and fun today as it did back then, and this is the best collection of their works, including all of the Slade's hit singles from the early '70s, from 1971's &quot;Get Down And Get With It&quot; to 1975's &quot;Thanks For The Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam)&quot;.
 
 Slade scored a whopping 11 Top Five hits between 1971 and 1974 (five of which topped the charts), and they're all here. So are their latter-day chart entries, like 1983's #2 hit &quot;My Oh My&quot;, but Slade never got better than they did at their stomping glitter-rock peak, and &quot;Feel The Noize&quot; captures them in all their glory, filled with Noddy Holder and Jim Lea's big, dumb, misspelled shout-along hits (&quot;Look Wot You Dun&quot;, &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;, &quot;Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me&quot; and &quot;Gudbuy T'Jane&quot;)
