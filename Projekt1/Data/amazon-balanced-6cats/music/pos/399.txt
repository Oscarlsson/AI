I have only recently become a country music fan.  I wasn't sure I would like Faith Hill, but this was the first CD of hers I purchased.  From the very first song "This Kiss," I was instantly drawn into her music.  What I love about her songs is that they are so real.  "You Give Me Love" is so real and so strong.  It's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change.  "The Secret of Life" has taken some getting used to.  It is not my absolute favorite on the CD.  "Me" is the song that means the most to me since I have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship.  And "I Love You" is a heart-jerker for those who have loved someone from afar.  She has a big voice, and she nails each song on this CD.  Give it a try
