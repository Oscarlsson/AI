This cd has alot of tight hits including: Nann by Trick Daddy and Who Dat' by J.T. Money. There are too many good songs to name for this cd, those are the biggest I like and I like all the others too. I can practically just  listen to the whole cd without stopping it, which usually never happens  with other cd's b/c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs  are junk. But this cd has all the Hip Hop Hits that it proclaims. I suggest  anyone looking at this review or cd, to buy the cd. It's worth it,  definetely!  One last word is that you will have no regrets buying this cd  at all I think in my own opinion.I am from St. Louie and I am telling ya'll  to look out for a new group called NELLY also, there hit single is already  out &quot;Country Grammar&quot; and cd soon to be out. Get that when it  comes out to. Peace out ya'll
