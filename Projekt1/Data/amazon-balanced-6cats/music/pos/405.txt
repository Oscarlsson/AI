this is a very well done record by 3 of Raps most elite personalities.  Cube, Dub, & Mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record.  The beats are amazing on all the tracks.  This is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button.  For me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them.  If you're a fan of the whole West Coast gangsta rap thing, You GOTTA HAVE THIS!  My Fav tracks are "All the Critics in New York", "Do you like Criminals", "Gangsta's make the World go Round", "Westward Ho!", & "Hoo Bangin'"...although like i said, all the tracks are badass.  peac
