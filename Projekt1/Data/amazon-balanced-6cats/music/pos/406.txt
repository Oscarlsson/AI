Tosca's Suzuki is not breaking any ground, but by God they have mastered the art. This album is just so professional sounding, very nicely produced. This is how I envision trance to sound like, so much garbage out there it taked a while to sift through and find a golden little record like this. Funky bassbeats and killer sounds. It's what they call ethereal....I think. It flows so well from track to track, quite the odyessy in under an hour
