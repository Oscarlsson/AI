Right, so, you're reading this either because you are a big Oasis fan and realize that this album is wonderful, or because you've heard some Oasis songs on the ever-disappointingly-dull radio and it's sparked yer interest.  
"The Masterplan" is a compilation of Oasis B-Sides that have been released over the years.  What has always made Oasis the best band in the world is the fact that the songs that they include on their "albums proper" are not necessarily their best songs.  As such, songs like "Acquiesce", "Talk Tonight" and "Stay Young" are vacant on their albums, yet they represent the best of this lovely band and are included  here in stunning fashion.  
So in summary, I absolutely do not recommend you buy this album until you at least own and fall in love with "Definitely Maybe" and "Morning Glory".  
To those who own and love this album, it is a part of rock history and is not to be overlooked.
