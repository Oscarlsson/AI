There are some amazing moments on this record.  I find myself freaking out to three songs in a row, and waiting for the fourth song to end.  The De La collaboration is weak; it's got the great Wild-Style instrumental but the chorus is obnoxious.  Some of the more R&B-toned tracks fall flat in my opinion.
