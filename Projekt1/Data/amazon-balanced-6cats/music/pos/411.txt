Fournier plays exquisitely, imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise.  Although his interpretation is Romantic, the spirit is all Bach with no egoism on the part of Fournier.  There is both serenity and tension in these recordings, and Fournier's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available
