Can't really add much to the reviews. This is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older. I'll admit that when this came out in '94, I only bumped the singles. It didn't grab me at the time. Sometime around '97 I gave it a spin and I've been loving it ever since. There are plenty of bangers on the album, but classics like "Pour Out A Little Liquor", "Str8 Ballin' ", "How Long Will They Mourn Me", Cradle To The Grave", and "Under Pressure" make this album worth owning all by themselves. The rest of the songs are on point too -- there isn't much filler on this album. The production is handled by Warren G. & Nate Dogg (1), the awesone yet underrated Easy Mo B (1), Johnny J (1), Jay & Mopreme (1), Jay & Syke (1), Stretch (1), and Thug Music (4). I'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks.

The only tracks that I would call skip material are "Sh** Don't Stop" and "Don't Get It Twisted". "Sh** Don't Stop" is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive. The production is on "Don't Get It Twisted" cool, but it's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it (in my opinion).

Volume 1 is a passionate, if at times misdirected, release from the Thug Life camp. The production is nothing short of vintage mid 90's Cali vibes. It holds up very well 13 years after its release. Of course, if you're a Tupac completist, you probably have this album already. But even if you're not a Pac fan, this should be a part of your collection.
