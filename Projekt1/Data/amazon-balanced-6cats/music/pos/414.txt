MariaS and Srayle, if you like the Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston,  Personally, I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on Guaraldi's works.  The piano is brillaint sounding and at volume, thru a good system sounds like there's a piano in the room.  It should be emphatically understood, you are buying Winston in this case, and not Guaraldi.  I have both versions
