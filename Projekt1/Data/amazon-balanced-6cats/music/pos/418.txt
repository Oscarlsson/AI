Wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album. Its just that darn good of a song. But hey, the whole album is good. the title track is brutally awesome, especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd (iron maiden box set). and murders in the rue morgue is another classic. then there is drifter, and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan (who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort). Maybe not as good as their debut album, but still a masterpeice of an album
