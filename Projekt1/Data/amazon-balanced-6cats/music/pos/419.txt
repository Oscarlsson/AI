Sony / Legacy does a fine job with this compilation, BUT it could've been much better IMO!! Here's what I did to improve this CD (fans can do the same thing!! There's enough CD space available!)...
Include the FULL LENGTH VESRION of 'Encore' (the single mix has to GO!), and add the following RARE BONUS TRACKS...

16. 'At Last You're Mine' (fr.'Heavenly Bodies' SDTK 1985)  
17. 'Steppin' Into The Night' (fr.'Armed & Dangerous' SDTK 1986). 

The single version of 'Got To Be Real' is fine because it includes Cheryl's trademark "Soo-Hoo, Soo-Hoo" vocal break that's absent on the longer album version. 
All in All, I'd recommend this CD to anybody that wants the best Cheryl Lynn compilation, but serious fans WILL want more!!
'The Best Of Cheryl Lynn, Vol.2' has been LONG OVERDUE for years, but you may have to make that one yourself until Rhino does the job!
Peace, SD
