This movie was a favorite in our household and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the DVD, so we searched for the soundtrack.  I actually chose this volume over volume 1 for two reasons...it contains the favorite from the movie, "I want to grow old with you" actually sung by Adam Sandler and secondly, because Volume 1 contains the song that Adam Sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend, which contains quite a bit of profanity, so I didn't want to get it for my kids.  I would have given it five stars, but we find the introduction by Billy Idol at the start of the last track, "I want to grow old with you," which is dialog from the movie, to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song, which I mentioned was the absolute favorite
