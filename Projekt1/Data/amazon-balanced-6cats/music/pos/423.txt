I am 62 years old, and seen them all.  I have NEVER seen anyone as visually and emotionally stunning as Beth Hart at the Paradiso!  Simply the most powerful stage performance I have ever witnessed!  She takes every single song to an epic level of entertainment, and just plain never coasts through a song. Some of the spectators in attendance looked almost scared by what they were seeing, and most were mesmerized by her on-stage and off stage sexually potent antics!  She has been compared to Janis.  I saw Janis twice, and Beth Hart would bury Janis in any category!  I can't imagine how she can possibly maintain a level like that captured at the Paradiso for very long--it just doesn't seem humanly possible!  I am so glad someone was there with so highly skilled a video crew to capture one of the most shattering evenings of music ever.  Magnificent in its fury!
