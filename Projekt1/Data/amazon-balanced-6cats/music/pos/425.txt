Like Louis Jordan, his less well-known contemporary jump/jive artist, Cab Calloway fits into an area much beloved by Americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre-rock and roll music. Though in truth I do love Jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of R&amp;B, Calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive/jump music can't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart
