I have followed the Enigma project for a long time, and haven't found myself disappointed with a single release thus far. (That is, considering I am reviewing an older album.) 'The Cross of Changes,' the second chapter in the Enigma project, offers philosophical insight into Micheal Crétu's personal beliefs, in the form of an 'enigmatic' symphony of soft composition and chanson. While each album seems to hold it's own unique interpretation of life, I believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love, peace and wholeness within its listeners.

The lyrical value of 'The Cross of Changes' seems to surpass that of its instrumental quality, which is, at times, rather poor in comparison to some of Micheal's other works. However, the lyrics are reassuring and inspiring, none-the-less, and make the entire experience worthwhile.

Buyers who are curious about Enigma probably shouldn't start with this album, as it seems to be one of those things you appreciate only after hearing some of the latter releases. (In my case, at least.) The first album I purchased was 'Love, Sensuality, Devotion' (the greatest hits album) -- a good start, considering you will get a fair idea of what Enigma is all about.

By the way, I am curious about track number 2 -- everytime I listen to it, I faintly hear Sandra chanting "open your heart, and push the limits..." in the background, though it could just be my imagination. It's strange that I mention that, because 'Push the Limits' was released after this album
