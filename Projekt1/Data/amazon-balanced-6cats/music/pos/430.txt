Brubeck and Desmond work their special magic here and produce their finest live recording.  This is sophisticated improv to tame the beast.  I have listened to these tracks uncountable times and I never get tired of them.   This is truely a wistful soundtrack to transport one to a higher realm.   Try this the next time you are caught in heavy traffic on a rainy  afternoon.  You won't mind the delay.  It never fails
