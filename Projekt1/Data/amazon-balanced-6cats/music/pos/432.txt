What can you say about MFL that hasn't already been said. Sublime, perfect, classic. This is still the definitive recording of the show, and no one has ever come close to the original cast. Sadly, while the movie is wonderful, had Warner Bros. used Andrew's it might have been one of the greatest film musicals of all time. And while Audrey Hepburn gamely gives it her all, Andrew's had clearly made Eliza Doolittle her own, and she would have been uncomparable on film, and raised the level of the entire movie. Well, the rest is history, Andrews went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60's.
Still, probably the best example of a play being adapted into a musical. As George Bernard Shaw said (when he finally gave in and saw it during it's London run) " I don't know where Shaw ends and Lerner and Lowe begins.
