I just love this CD. Over 8 years ago my much older coworker turned me onto this album. It is definetly not just for St Paddy's day. This is an album you can listen to over and over. The Sinead songs are a bit whiney, but she does have an excellent voice. You can not get better that Mic and Sting. Sting's song is just incredible.
