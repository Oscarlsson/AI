I'm not sure what to call this CD other than genius. This was the first CD I've heard from Sonata Arctica and it's still my favorite.

I'm not really really big on power metal/epic metal, but I defintely enjoy SA and Kamelot. With that said, I think this CD can even entertain those not interested in power metal. My friend enjors radio rock and rap, but after hearing me play this CD where we work, he begged me to make him a copy.

Towards the actual CD, i'm not quite sure I can put what's in it into words. Songs like Silver Tongue and Broken have a very distinct, unique sound. The ballads, Draw Me and The Misery are both superb efforts, each making the listener feel Tony Kakko's pain. My favorite song would have to be a dead heat between The Misery and Gravenimage.

The keyboardist in this band works in overdrive in each song. He plays fast, and keeps the melody in each beautiful and interesting (and lighthearted at times). The guitarist plays very fast when he needs to, and the right power chords other times. He's quite good. Overall, the sound they eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking. They do a great job.

The lyrics seem much better than older releases (english lessons?) but still can be a bit odd. "...with long haired drummer in band" springs to mind. Still at least they write about mundane things... I love Kamelot, but the Knight in Shining armor routine will get old eventually. Anyway, the vocals are very well done, he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite well, too. (They'd make Queen jealous!)

Overall, I can't praise this CD enough. Every song is an adventure, none of them a tedious or unnecessary one at that. I would say that anyone could enjoy this CD, but I'd first recommend it to those who are tired of the American screamfest metal that's going on today. Then I'd recommend it to power metal fans, and so on. 

Simply put, this is one of the best CDs I own. Give it a chance
