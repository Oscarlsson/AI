The Best of Taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums consisted of two studio albums &quot;Taste&quot;, &quot;On The Boards, and the two live albums &quot;Live Taste&quot;, and &quot;Live At The Isle Of Wight&quot;.  This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic, &amp; slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like &quot;Sugar Mama&quot; and &quot;I Feel Good&quot; included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of &quot;Catfish&quot; to the more acoustic cover of &quot;Leavin' Blues&quot;.  The cuts from &quot;On The Boards&quot; become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like &quot;On The Boards&quot; and &quot;It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again&quot; highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like &quot;Eat My Words&quot; spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are &quot;Dual Carriageway Pain&quot; from &quot;Taste, and &quot;Morning Sun&quot; from &quot;On The Boards&quot;.  The live concert favorite &quot;Sinner Boy&quot; provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album &quot;Rory Gallagher&quot;.  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports
