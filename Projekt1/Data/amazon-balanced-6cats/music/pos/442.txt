Originally released in 1972,this was Can's fourth record as well as their follow-up to 'Tago Mago'(see my review).Some really superbly written and played cuts here to fully take in(might take several spins)are "Pinch",liked Michael Karoli's(R.I.P.)stellar guitar solos,the somewhat stunning "Vitamin C" and this reissue's lengthiest track,the ten-minute "Soup".First rate German progressive kraut.After I listened to this CD a second time,I realized that 'Ege Bamyasi' may have very well been a heavy influence on later bands like Gary Numan,Pere Ubu,Public Image Ltd. and Stereolab.Silly cover,don't you agree
