This was 2Pac's last good album before he joined Deathrow.He was a good rapper but never the best,he started too much beef with other rappers for no reason.He had alot of beef with east coast rappers like Biggie,Nas,Jay-Z and Mobb Deep,but he never opened his mouth about Wu-Tang because they would lyrically destroy him.This is one of the best albums from 95 right behind Gza's Liquid Swords and Mobb Deep's The Infamous
