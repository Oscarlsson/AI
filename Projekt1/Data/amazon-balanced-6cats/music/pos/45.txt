Growing up with Classical Rock and having enjoyed rock music by Rod Stewart, I didn't think I'd like this CD. One evening I was having dinner at a friend's home and they had this one playing. It was beautiful. Being a little older now (in my early 40's), I enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now. This CD of Rod's was nostalgic, romantic and extremely easy to listen to.
