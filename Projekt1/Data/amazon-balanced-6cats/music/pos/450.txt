On this album,Ice switches to a thrashcore style lovers of the style will go mad about.The songs are mega fast,with furious social lyrics and full of hatred.If you're into thashcoreand dig bands like Ratos De Porao,get this one at once.It suffers from some degree of dynamic compression   though,but if you can correct that,it'll blow your brains againt the nearest wall
