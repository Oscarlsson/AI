its quite difficult to sum up the impact of this cd with few mere words. suffice to say, level 1 is a timeless classic, in fact, it was my entry pass into the realm of d-n-b. logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b heads &amp; music lovers in general. demon's theme, western, danny's song &amp; horizons remain some of my favorite songs in any genre. bukem's level 1 displays his flawless production &amp; track mastery which cascades the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor adrenaline &amp; ambient bliss
