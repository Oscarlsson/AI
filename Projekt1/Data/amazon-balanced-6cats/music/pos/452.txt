I'll begin by saying this isn't the only "Ministry Of Sound Chillout Sessions" I've heard, in fact I love the MoS brand, so I can honestly say that EVERY single compilation has it's on flavour, from the "Clubber's Guide To" to "The Annual (Spring/ Summer/ Annual)" Which means, the previous and next instalments don't necesarily match this review. With that being said: This particular Compilation has a very elegant/ european/ underground feel to it. It's indie electronica and some rock-gone-acid-jazz, and of course, it wouldn't be European without some House music. It's fascinating that in the middle of an elephant-driven craze a song talking about taking a holiday so someone can love someone better starts to blend seamlessly. Yes, it's THAT type of record. It's not Pop, it's not a 'greatest hits' mash-up and it's definately not boring. I remember the first time I heard it (I was working graveyard shifts at that time) I'd listen to the first cd and it'd make me fall sound asleep after the first half. It's not a bad thing, it's just very relaxing, very soothing to the soul (Specially the Lior song "This Old Love", which helped me get through a rather painful breakup) Overall, it's THAT kind of session. It makes you think, it makes you apreciate it, it's a 'life soundtrack' from track 1 of the second disc ("we all live and die" from Kinda New) giving you a morning starter to the soothing track "Run (Jacknife Lee Remix)" on the first disc which invites you to THE promised dreamland. Nothing you'd expect from a regular MoS compilation, everything you'd expect from a really good chillout compilation. A MUST for any true Chillout Junkie
