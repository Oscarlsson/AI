 The debut release entitled "Breathe" by artist called Blue Stone is one of the best New Age albums that I've heard in years! I would even go as to say that it is even better than any of Amethystiums albums. "I Am" is heavenly and "Contact" is an eerie number that is destined to be a future classic!
