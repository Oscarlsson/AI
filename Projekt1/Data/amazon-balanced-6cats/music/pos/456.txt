The only problem with Betty Buckley is that she isn't nearly as well known as she deserves to be, considering the length and quality of her career.  This album of somgs from her 1996 AIDS benefit concert at Carnegie Hall is simply flawless.  Naturally, it's heavy on music from Broadway, the London stage, and film scores, but she sings one Mary Chapin Carpenter song, &quot;Come On, Come On,&quot; that comes from none of those sources and is guaranteed to give you chills every time you hear it.  If you're tired of recordings by singers of little talent and less style, listen to Betty Buckley for fifteen minutes and you'll feel as if you'd never heard real singing before.  She is an original, and she has the best voice in theater of this or almost any decade
