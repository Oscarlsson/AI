All-instrumental collections of bluegrass are hard to find, and if you like it when a band takes a break from singing and just plays their instruments, here's your chance for total immersion. All the songs on this compilation are from Rounder Records albums released 1976-1998, by artists with familiar names like Alison Krauss and Tony Rice, and others you may never have heard of.  All are first rate, foot stompin' renditions of bluegrass traditionals, with a few great originals -- Bill Monroe's &quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&quot; and Earl Scruggs' &quot;Foggy Mountain Chimes.&quot; Best known for most listeners is a rousing version of &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; by the Johnson Mountain Boys. If you like bluegrass with plenty of pickin' at breakneck speed, this CD will keep you smilin' through many, many replays
