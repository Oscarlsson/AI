Have loved this album since it first came out years ago (bought on vinyl - lost to the mists of time). The CD was out of print but I kept looking and found it on Amazon (it was re-released), Yeah!!!!
Last Steam Engine, From the Cradle to the Grave, Louise, Owls, You Don't have to Need Me - some of my favorites.

This, to me, is Kottke in his prime
