I don't know where this guy gets off saying that the drummer, Jorge Rossy, and the bassist, Larry Grenadier, &quot;are competent but do nothing overtly interesting&quot;.  Jorge incredible groove, use of space, and musicality is as good as one could ask for, and Grenadier's huge warm tone, amazing time, and great thematic development is unparalleled by other bassists of his generation
