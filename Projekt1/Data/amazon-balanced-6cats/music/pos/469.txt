Along with Son Volt's &quot;Trace&quot; and Nadine's &quot;Downtown Saturday,&quot; this is one of the best rock albums of the 1990s and certainly one of the best alt.country albums ever released.  Standout  tracks include &quot;Blue Canoe,&quot; &quot;Soul Sister,&quot; &quot;Eyes  of a Child,&quot; &quot;Wink&quot; and &quot;Let's Go Runnin'&quot; all  examples of first class rock songwriting.  The rest ain't too shabby  either.  Fans of the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd in particular  should give this Mississippi band a listen.  But so should any mainstream  rock fan
