This is Beck's coming of age album.  "Loser" was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and "Mellow Gold" landed Beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation.  His earlier recordings, featured in an album entitled "One Foot In The Grave," were evidence enough of his musical genius.  

"Mellow Gold" might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for Beck.  If that's the case, then "Mutations" was his rite of passage, a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album.  "Mutations" has dark, brooding moments with haunting melodies.  

His lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness.   In one song, he sings, "Looking back on some dead world, that looks so new."  We can't always be sure of his references or implications, but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful.  His ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful.  

With "Mutations," Beck has secured an important place in music history.  This is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play.  The arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft.
