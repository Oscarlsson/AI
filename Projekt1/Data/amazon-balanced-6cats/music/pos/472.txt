I bought this because I thought this cd would be nice to listen to in the car while on out and about. I love that our 2 1/2 year old daughter who is from China loves this cd and will request it "Chinese Flute" please. This is just one way to keep her heritage alive and expose her to different kinds of music beyond the Wiggles & Lilo & Stitch CD.

I would have liked to have had more information on the songs like what province of China. But not having this information really does not lessen the rating of 5 stars! Our family thinks this is an excellent cd
