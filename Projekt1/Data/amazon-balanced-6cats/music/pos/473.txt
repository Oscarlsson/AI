With Freddie backed by Herbie,Ron Carter,and Tony Williams.This is high-flight crisp and inspiring music.Worthy of repeated listenings. Listen and enjoy.Williams is over the top,very creative and will continue to suprise you with his unceasing inventiveness.I've  always noticed how Carter and Williams really spur Hancock on as you will notice in this set.Hancock,one the the truly great pianist of post-bop era,sounds like he is his having the time of his life.It doesn't get much better than this.
