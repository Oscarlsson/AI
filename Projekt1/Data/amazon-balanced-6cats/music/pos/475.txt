this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass. one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long, winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know, this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this, they made some great albums and some good ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it
