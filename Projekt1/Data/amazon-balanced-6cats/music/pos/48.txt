The series of "Golden Age of American Rock & Roll" released by
ACE couldn't have a better end. During the past 15 years they
have delighted us with a series of 10 CD's with 30 songs each
remembering the Rock & Roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. One reason for their tremendous success
is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from
what year the original song was. Now besides these series of 10
CD's from the R&R era they have launched another 2 special
editions with the same title: one with the special novelty
edition and another with the special country edition. Both
deserve more than 5 stars. 
The song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight!
Most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time
ago since these weren't available after the time they were
top hits. I never found them back on what compilation so ever
until ACE put them all together 45 years later. And with a
sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm.
Therefore don't hesitate. Buy it together with the country
edition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure; 60
songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them.
