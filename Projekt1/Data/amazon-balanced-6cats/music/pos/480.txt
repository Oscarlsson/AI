If you're a fan of Latin music and especially Spanish guitar, you will LOVE Cafe Tropical. Every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar, to piano, violin, trumpet, and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments. Every time I put this CD on I hear new things, which I find makes for an even more enjoyable listen.

As usual, Johannes Linstead delivers some of the most catchy and memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre, and of course his guitar playing speaks for itself. Highly recommended
