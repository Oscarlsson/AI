This guy is amazing. I keep playing this for people and they love it and tell me they have never heard anything like it. I even got a huge discount at the auto shop for just having this CD. After the mechanic took my car from the parking lot and listened to one minute of this, he came in and said
"that sounds crazy! you have to let me copy this"
After getting a nice chunk of cash taken off my bill, this cd already paid for itself and never collects dust.

I know everyone compares Clark to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, and Autechre, but for good intentions. He is already that good, after just a few releases
