No doubt about it, from start to finish, this is a classic for anybody's collection. I can remember back in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today. This was rap music at it's best from Spice 1 to DJ Quik. There will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods. So add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap, west coast fan(like myself), or just want to hear a great soundtrack
