Eddie's first all-studio recording, and the album that got me hooked.  I must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live, this album demonstrates the range and diversity of Eddie from Ohio.  &quot;Oh My  Brother&quot; is a particular favorite with Julie Murphy Wells displaying  her amazing range and beautiful voice, and Robbie Schaffer's talent for  emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation.  If this song  doesn't touch your heart, you have no appreciation for music.  A particular  plus on this album is a beautiful violin solo of &quot;Yerushalyim Shel  Zahav&quot; by guest musician Pete Wilson on &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; another  song by Robbie, this time also performed by him.  As always, the amazing  prowess of this group is displayed magnificently
