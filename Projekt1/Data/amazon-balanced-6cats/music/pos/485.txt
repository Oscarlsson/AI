This is a really great CD. The Candian and American Idol winners are not usually that great, but Melissa is an exception. She just belts out her soul whenever she's at the microphone. My absolute favourite is definitely "Alive". It's just a beautiful song. Really, I recommend this CD who likes songs with great messages and a good beat. She's a great Pop/rock singer. You can't go wrong with this CD
