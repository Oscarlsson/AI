I've been listening to Satoshi Tomiie for a long time and this is definetly one of his best CD's yet. Its one of those cd's that is a must have before a road trip. Just play it and let it ride. From beginning to end it keeps your ears on high alert just waiting for that next track to hit. Before you know it your at the end, but who says you cant just hit repeat and start the ride all over again.
