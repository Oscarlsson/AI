"Burnin'" was the last album by the Wailers as a collective group, afterwhich Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and Marley reformed his group, calling it "Bob Marley & the Wailers" in 1974.  The album shows the original three at their best, balancing lead vocals on several songs between Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh.  The album not only serves to further reveal Bob's soon-to-be legendary work, but also to show the talent of Bunny Wailer with his lead vocals on songs like "Hallelujah Time" and "Pass It On".

The album also shows Tosh taking lead with Marley on "One Foundation" and alongside Marley on "Get Up, Stand Up".  The album's biggest gem, however, was "I Shot the Sheriff," soon to be made a favorite in the U.S. and the U.K. by rock artist Eric Clapton on his 1974 "451 Ocean Boulevard" album.

The deluxe edition also features a concert from the tour in Leeds, U.K. just one week before the Wailers broke up.  (Bunny, however, was already absent, having refused to tour outside of Jamaica once and for all earlier that year.  His temporary replacement,the Wailers' old vocal coach, Joe Higgs was also absent, quitting the tour after they completed their shows in the U.S.)  1973's "Burnin'" shows the original Wailers at their very best before their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans everywhere, I can guarentee it
