The first time ever I saw this group "Amici forever" as they were singing "Unchained melody", I have confused that song like classical music. Because, it was very familiar. Actually, I didn't know exactly what's that song that moment. Finally, I knew that song is popular music I used to sing. So, laughed myself.
It was brilliant and great performance I ever heared before.
I bought DVD, too. And I recommended my friend and he also felt their singing like me. He said great and thanks to me
