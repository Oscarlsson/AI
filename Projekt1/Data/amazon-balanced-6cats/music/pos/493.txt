This is the first of Alison's album's that I bought, many years ago.....I've watched her career blossom.....she was an unknown when she recorded this album but in my opinon, it's her best!  True bluegrass, beautiful voice, wonderful music!  I've had the opportunity to see her and the band in concert several times and their music never leaves me disappointed
