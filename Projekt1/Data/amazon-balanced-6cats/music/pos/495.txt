I went through a painful final separation from the love of my life when this CD was released in 1997, and I identified with every song.  I listened to this CD over and over for several months.  I saw Kim at the &quot;House of Blues&quot; in Hollywood during that time and sang along to every song.  This CD is my favorite &quot;bitter sweet&quot; CD of all time.  I love you, Kim
