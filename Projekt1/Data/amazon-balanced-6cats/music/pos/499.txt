I absolutely loved the string music on Track 3.  I remembered it from an old PC RPG called Quest for Glory IV.  I was disappointed to find out that Track 4 was only a minute and a half long, because I grew up loving that song from the various places I heard it (Fantasia and a kid Detective PC game from the late 80's).  
Overall, though, Grieg's greatest hits is a must-have for collectors of classical music.  Grieg is revered as Norway's greatest composer of all time and he certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines.
