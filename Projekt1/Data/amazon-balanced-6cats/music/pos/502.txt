King Elvis.
Queen Madiona.
Prince Justin.
And now Princess Hillary!
Duff is slowly making her way up to the queen of pop.
It was espicially nice to here my teen idol singing all Christmas classics with some other pop stars too.
If you LOVE Hillary Duff and you REALLY NEED some new CD's by her and it's Crhistmas time then this is CD for you!
Let me tell ya somethin', that girl can sing.
So go to the CD store.
Buy it!
Play it!
Plop down on the couch and have a glass of egg nog.
