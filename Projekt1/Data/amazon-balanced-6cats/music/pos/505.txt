Not only do you get some great music with this cd, you get the beginnings of Climax as well. (The last 2 cuts are essentially Sonny Geraci solo songs done by 1/2 of the band that would play on Climax records)

Includes their 4 hits (Time Wont let me, Girl In Love, Respectable & Help Me Girl) and a slew of other VERY like-minded material. If you like any of their 4 hits, you will LOVE the rest. If you like Climax, you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially Climax tunes
