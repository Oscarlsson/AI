I saw this band open for Placebo in Tampa, Fl. I had never heard of them before that night. I bought the CD immediately. Though it's a bit plain, It's a GREAT CD. It's a comforting kind of plain & It rocks. I played it in my cd player for about a month straight. The lead singers voice is unique. This band definitely has much potential to become a well known group. A great debut album. 
If you ever get to see them live DO IT! Their live show definitely makes the cd come alive.
