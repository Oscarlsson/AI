I caught Sonny in a live performance this past November, so I got to hear at least 3 tracks off of his most current album...Sonny Please.  He opened the set with a fiery "Sonny Please" which smoked for a good 15 minutes (I believe that Victor Lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section helped do the driving).  For a man approaching 77 years of age, I was impressed with not only Sonny's playing and gracious presence, but his stamina in performing two 40 - 50 minute sets...trust me, the man can still play!   This album may not be another "Saxophone Colossus" or "The Bridge", but it is a solid recording and should satisfy a majority of Sonny's fans.  If you have no recorded music by this jazz legend, this CD is a respectable starting point
