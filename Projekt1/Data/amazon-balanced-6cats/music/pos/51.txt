This album is absolutely beautiful. The full musical sound and talent of Calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of Iron & Wine make the perfect match. 

It's almost unheard of that I love EVERY song on an album, but this one makes the cut. Each song wraps you in a warm trance, a coccoon of well-being. It has a really positive emotional effect on me. It creates an ambiance of gentle strength.

Wonderful. I really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums
