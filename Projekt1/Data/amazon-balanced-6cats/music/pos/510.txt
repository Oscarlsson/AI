The first cd from Baby Anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare. I wouldn't claim that's a bad thing, but don't expect to be surprised if you're familiar with the genre. Overall it's a solid offering from Baby Anne and delivers the bass.

The second cd is a surprising mix from Jen Lasher, who has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more electro feel. To those who have labeled this "industrial" I will say first and foremost that you are wrong. There is not one remotely industrial track on the cd. What she does provide is an extremely varied mix of synthpop, house, and a couple breaks tracks, all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare, sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound. From someone quite familiar with electropop artists I can't recommend highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and electro afficianados alike.

My only complaint is the strikingly misplaced Wolfsheim track, which I can only assume fueled the misguided and completely false Depeche Mode comparison from another reviewer.
