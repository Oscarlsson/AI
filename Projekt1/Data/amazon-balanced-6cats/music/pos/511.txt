Darren Aronofsky's movies are beautiful masterpieces. From "Pi" to "The Fountain", going through "Requiem For a Dream", they will forever stand as timeless jewels. So they are hard to top in any way, but Clint Mansell has been able to do it every single time, scoring each of them.

For "The Fountain", he teamed up once more with Kronos Quartet and had Scottish post-rock band Mogwai join in too, to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove, in a very organic way. The central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses.

The combination of the talents of Mansell, the Quartet and Mogwai yields a relatively dark, yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score
