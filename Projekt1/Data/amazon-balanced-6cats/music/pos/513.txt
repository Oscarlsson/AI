This album has some of the best country songs in the business.  Mark sings songs straight from his heart.  There are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like &quot;Too cold at home&quot;, &quot;I'll think of  something else&quot;, and &quot;Almost goodbye&quot; to the fast, heels  kicking &quot;Bubba shot the jukebox&quot;, and &quot;Going through the big  'd'&quot;.  These songs are about real life realtionships  and how they  affect the heart. So if you're in the mood to cry about that lost love or  smile now that they're gone this is the album for you
