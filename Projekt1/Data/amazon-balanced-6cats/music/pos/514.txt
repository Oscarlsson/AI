Another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of Lou Donaldson. The album released on Blues Notes features Lou's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones. Lou even opts to 'chill' out on a  number called 'Over The Rainbow' but on other numbers like 'Donkey Walk'  Lou's style and also his unique band really shine. The unmistakable hammond  adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and  swinging drums this brings together another great album.Keep on funkin Mr  Lou Donaldson!!!!
