The Best R&B Band Ever!!! I know some will disagree with me, but this is the band that really rock my boat. I mean, they were awesome and it wasn't forced or fake. The rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down. I am in the process of getting ALL their cds, but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music
