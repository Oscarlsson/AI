Like it says in the ("33 1/3") liner notes: "...world class chops and originality".  If jazz is your bag and guitar licks get your attention, these tracks will set off fireworks!  My music collection started circa 1960, but these guys made it to the top of my list in a heartbeat!  If I could, I'd give it 10 stars
