Hermann Baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd. I don't think that there is recording of the Haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance, even better than Tuckwell's. The cadenzas are absolutely awesome. I haven't listened to the Rosetti before but Baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well. Clevenger plays ok on the Haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. I'm a saxophone player but I can recognize  true musicianship when I hear it and Baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. Highly recommended
