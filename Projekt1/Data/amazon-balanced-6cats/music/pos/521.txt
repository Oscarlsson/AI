Although a couple of reviews said this was a great product, I was wary as I have never found anything that actually worked.  I have a job where my mind is always on the go, and often have a week or two a month where I just can't get to sleep.

The CD arrived during one of these times, I put it on my portable CD player not expecting too much, and almost imediately felt a bit queazy, nothing too bad, and on later research this basically proves the Delta wave theory Dr. Thompson is working.

The only time in the past when I have gone to sleep so easily when I have been out partying all night when I was younger.  I play the CD on a stereo I have in my room, and I rarely wake up at all.

I am certainly going to buy more of his CD's
