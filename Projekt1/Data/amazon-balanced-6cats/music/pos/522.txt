While Photek was (and still is) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound, his approach changes significantly on &quot;Solaris.&quot; Starting off with the first three tracks, his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work (especially on &quot;Modus Operandi&quot;), but sound more full, more resonant. The tracks where he wanders into the realm of House were quite repeditive, and despite Robert Owen's wonderful efforts (first time I've heard him), they were lacking. The best track on the album, and one of the best Photek works is definitely &quot;Infinity.&quot; The rumbling bass really cuts right to the core, and reminds me a little of Source Direct. The trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music, but the more ethereal &quot;Halogen&quot; left an impression. A wash of sound that previously Parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll, it comes off much better for the lack of any true form. Not a great album, but solid and indicative of where Photek would like to go in terms of his future works
