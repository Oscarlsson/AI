Link this CD of great melodies with  "The Best of The Browns (1954-1967).  You'll not regreat the quality.  Such easy listening.  This group is simply the best.  I also suggest reading Maxine Brown's book "Looking Back to See, A country Music Memoir."  It's a well written (and interesting) cover of the the history of The Browns
