As a kid, Out Of The Blue was one of the first albums (actually, 8-track) I paid for.  That decision was made after hearing "Sweet Talking Woman" as a single, and after I bought it, the album grew and grew with me.  Every few weeks, a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable.  The first few weeks, it was "Sweet Talking Woman," "Turn To Stone," and "Mr. Blue Sky" (all pop perfection); the next few weeks, it was "Wild West Hero," "Across The Border," and "Jungle."  After three months, there wasn't a corner or edge of the album I didn't know and like.  
     Thirty years later, the remastered CD finally comes around and, through the fan club at [...](Which I heartily recommend because of their labors of love) I bought this and Balance Of Power (review coming).  I have to say I was a little scared to put this on again after all this time as my tastes of music have evolved and the label of "pretentious" has been placed on them by my 16 year old son ( a prog rocker, nonetheless).  
    A big sigh of relief--the CD holds the same joys it did before.  The Moog synthesizer riff by Jeff Lynne in "Turn To Stone" still pumps the heart, while "Sweet Talking Woman" and songs like "Wild West Hero" and "Jungle" still delight.  But I'm amazed at how things like the "Concerto For A Rainy Day" (four songs including "Mr. Blue Sky"--still the brightest jewel on this album) still hold together, and songs like "Stepping Out" and "Sweet Is the Night" step up to dig their hooks into you even today. 
   While the remastering is very good and makes some tunes step up ("Across The Border"'s horns beg you to crank them up), there are a few drop outs ("Night In The City" has a couple), and of course, my tastes probably don't translate to everyone.  But, my 16 years old has given the album a careful listen, and he hasn't returned it to me yet--I imagine for the next few weeks I'll still enjoy listening to "Out Of The Blue" from downstairs for a few more weeks..
