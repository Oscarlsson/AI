The title track is one of the best country songs ever performed proving the talents of Hank as a true caftsman when it comes to song writing. Fitting that category as well are Outlaw Women, and Women I've Never Had. Hank also lends his southern rockin' style to White Lightnin' written by J.P. Richardson a.k.a. the big bopper.  What Bocephus album would be complete without at least one tribute to his father? Hank serves up a whopper here along with Waylon Jennings in a classic called The Conversation.  In a time, much like today, when country was straying from it's roots Hank finds a way to keep the southern bluesy traditions alive on all ten cuts of this must have country album
