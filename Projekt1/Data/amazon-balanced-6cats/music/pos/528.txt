people, what a killer release this is. i bought it in '92 when it was released, not knowing what to expect, as i had never heard a single cut from it. i knew Schonn was the axeman on this baby, and that was all i needed to know. i popped this cd in the player, and was instantly floored. what great melodic, poweful tunes filled my ears. i'm not much of a ballad fan, but even those are great. Dean Castronova on drums was the perfect choice for this type of release, as he adds the power to Schonn's precision. this is how Neal would have played with journey, had the suits let him do so. the Gioeli brothers, unknown to me at the time, do a masterful job as well. it's such a shame that great bands make an album or two, and just fade away, ie. Lynch Mob, Badlands and these guys, to name a few. this release is far superior to their second offering, but that one is pretty tasty as well. i suggest paying the coin for this cd, as it's worth every penny. Hardline 2 will run you about twice as much, but imports often do. get 'em both if ya' can, but this one is the best of the 2. peace.
