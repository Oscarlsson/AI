Tunisian Anouar Brahem's "Le Voyage de Sahar" finds him in the same company- pianist Francis Courturier and accordionist Jean-Louis Martinier- as 2002's highly acclaimed "Le pas du chat noir."
Having toured in support of that CD, the trio developed into a true group, something that Brahem accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble.
With "Voyage" Brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not as overtly "jazzy" as some of his earlier outings.
Nonetheless, he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid, richly evocative compositions that distill Arabic music and European jazz sensibilities with a warm, sonorous chamber music vibe.
Among the ports of call on this "Voyage" are "Zarabanda," whose elegant lope recalls the French Riviera.
Elsewhere the title track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue, while "Cordoba" and "Ete Andalous" are meditative pieces with a decidedly cinematic scope.  The gentle bounce of "Nuba" and introspection of "Les Jardins de Ziryab" both include uncredited but effective passages of voice.
Rarely do you hear music this gorgeous
