This truly is a masterpiece of pop music. There is not a wasted moment. The songs all blend together majestically one after the other. You really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect. 

I agree with the reviewer that stated that 'Don't Look Back' is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays. 

I don't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart. I had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive.
