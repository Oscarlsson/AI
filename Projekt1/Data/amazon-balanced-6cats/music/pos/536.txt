Gerry Beckley is "timeless". His new CD is awesome and seems to go back to his roots. His songs over the years last lifetimes and bring back amazing memories.This new CD just proves he hasnt lost his touch. Anyone who does not agree, doesnt know the real Gerry. I have had the privilege to meet him and talk with him many times, including being able to celebrate New Years eve with them after a concert with the rest of America and their families.He is one of the nicest people i have ever met, and his songs have always been a part of my life. I hope there are still many more CD's still to come and look forward to seeing him again in the near future in concert and afterwards
