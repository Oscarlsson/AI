I assume you already know what's on this recording or you wouldn't be here, right?  Don't you probably have a thirty-year-or-so old vinyl copy of this that you haven't listened to for years because it's dusty and has scratches and pops and who listens to that stuff anymore anyway?  

Well, I won't review the music here because others have done better than I would, but I will say that listening to this remaster through a high quality set of headphones (Sennheiser) has enabled me to hear this as if it were the first time.   It's totally worth the money to get this new version, and the bonus tracks just make it even more fun.
