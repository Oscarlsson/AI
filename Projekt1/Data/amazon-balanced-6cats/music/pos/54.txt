...because it felt like it predicted that I'd be listening to the cd someday.  I'm referring to the line "The kids of AD 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today."  Now I admit that I was 18 in 2000 so I guess I technically missed the literal kid description by a year, but the more general prediction of the inter-generational, timeless appeal of the Beatles was right on.  I didn't see them on the Ed Sullivan show.  I was born almost twelve years after they broke up, and about a year after the tragic shooting of John Lennon.  But I, like many, many other people born too late to have experienced Beatlemania as it was occuring, have since become a huge fan of all their work.

This album has my favorite of all the Beatle's songs:  I'll Follow The Sun.  That song alone is worth the five stars, but thankfully the rest of the album is great too.  This album gets a little bit too much grief, and it may not be quite as amazing as something like Abbey Road, but it's still better than just about anything else out there.
