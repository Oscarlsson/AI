Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter Trout weighing in first place.  As you can easily see from all of the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are: `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'. Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in the future. Highly recommended
