First off, to the above comments, while I thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons, and would be interested to read other history lessons from you, you have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the 300 Spartans at Thermopolye, but of the Graphic Novel. Now this is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense, but the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell itself.

**** Caution SPOILER ALERT *****

Besides that the Soundtrack is amazing and it is always a Joy to listen to a soundtrack that really captivates the real emotion of that particular scene, I especially enjoyed the music when they fight the "beasts" and it is really hard rock, and I especially LOVED the ending music when the entire Spartan Army is gathered and the one spartan is telling them to remember Leonidas (It is called Remember Us on the Soundtrack).

May we all find our own "Glorius Death
