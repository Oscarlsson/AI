I have to tell you Lionel Hampton has yet to be matched in talent, and drive on the "phones." Funny Story, it was Tito Puente the late and legendary " King of the Mambo" was the one who showed Lionel (by carefull persuation) the light of the "phones" and shuned him away from the piano. Unfortunatly not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but I believe they meet in the service or right after Tito was discharged for WW II. I can tell you Lionel, to me, is best know for His BIG version of "Flying Home". A bigger, badder version of the small groups version he did with Benny Goodman, and teddy wilson. Lionels closest match would have to be Red Narrvo form the 1930's, but still Mr. Hampton 's drive and moves on the stage has yet to be matched
