Ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl-led group sounds.  This time, there are six tunes that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire, this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there.  With enough (ten) top-10 songs to keep the music familiar, there are lots of seldom-found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp.  Between such monster hits as Lesley Gore's pre-womens' rights anthem &quot;You Don't Own Me&quot;, the Exciters go-and-get-him &quot;Tell Him&quot; and Kathy Young's barely pubescent &quot;A Thousand Stars&quot; are cradled such rarities as the Secrets' &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot; (a Madara-White, of &quot;You Don't Own Me&quot; and other Gore tunes fame, composition ), April Stevens' &quot;Teach Me Tiger&quot; (later with brother Nino Tempo striking it big with &quot;Deep Purple&quot;) and Timi Yuro's (of &quot;Hurt&quot; fame) &quot;What's A Matter Baby&quot;.  In this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is of substandard sound quality even so.  Many of the tracks (2,3,6,8,12-15,17,23,25,28) appear in stereo, the remainder in mono.  The 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented.  Ace again hits the mark with this new compilation
