Undoubtedly, Marnie belongs to the top list of Bernard Herrmann's best film scores, a wonderful musical image of Alfred Hitchcock's underrated movie. Written for small ensemble (strings, woods, harp and horns) Herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood, tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that Herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for Hitch. Joel McNeely's reading is simply stunning as ever, so is the performance, but I just don't like the overall acoustics on these Varèse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details. They simply are overheard in this muffled sound. This is far from ideal for recording a film score and I bet Herrmann would not have liked this! But, it's a great, great score
