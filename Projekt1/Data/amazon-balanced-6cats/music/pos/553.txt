I am new to Ron Sexsmith. Where have I been? This Cd is outstanding and so soothing.... The instrumentals are soul syrup, the melodies are whipped cream and the lyrics are full of cherries, nuts and fudge sauce.....It is putting something so sweet and so nurturing into the hearts and minds of the hungry and starving. I am still in the stage where his songs resonate in my mind just before I fall asleep at night and that waking up means I get to hear his "comfort food" again.... This honeymoon will last forever....  Fall in love folks, it's worth the risk....Calorie free, I promise...Thanks Ron, God Speed !
