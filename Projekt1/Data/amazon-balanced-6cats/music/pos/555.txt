This will be short.  It is worth the price of this album just to hear the Branford and Harry Connick Jr. duet Carolina Shout.  That being said, all of the other tracks on this album are excellent. From Jungle Blues to Doug Wamble's solo guitar on Autumn Lamp, with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for Romare Breaden's art.  A must have.  Branford keeps outdoing himself
