Ice Cube is back for his 6th solo with the Peace Disc.  This may be my favorite album from Cube (close with "Lethal Injection").  His lyrics are much different then his first few albums and the beats changed with tthe times but it's still nice to hear from Cube.  With 13 songs, none ar ebad, 5 are ok, 1 is almost a classic and the rest are good.  Guests are on 4 songs so you still get enough Cube to satisfy you.  Production is decent as well, Chuckey Thompson & One Eye each do 3 songs, Puff Daddy, Younglord, Bud'da, Battlecat, Dr. Dre, T-Bone and Charley Bear all do 1 song.  A must have album for fans of Ice Cube.
