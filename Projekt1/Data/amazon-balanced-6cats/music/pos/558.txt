I hesitated for so long to get this.  Having followed Moby's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years.  I like his early techno/rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns.  But I wondered: has Moby gone soft?  has he sold out?  I was pleasantly surprised.

Look at the cover and add rain.  That's the overall mood of this album.  I find rain to be cleansing on many levels, often building a mood of pensiveness, reflection and a fragile peacefulness.  There is a glorious melancholy in the music, the lyrics and the singing on the album.  Take the chilled out moments from Moby's other albums and build on it.  That's what he's done here.

Almost every song has singing - primarily Moby's longing, almost cyring, voice - and almost every song is for those rainy nights, when the world doesn't make sense, when longing for companionship and understanding burdens the heart, yet with a subtle hope underneath it all.  

It's downtempo, mellow, moody and sometimes sad.  But it is beautiful.  Don't expect "old" Moby, don't look for the commercial jingles of Play.  Just put it on and listen
