"Animal Farm" is a personal favorite of mine. And I dont understand why this song does't get more recognition - in my opinion, the most underrated song ever written (yes i know, its a bold statement). Theres something about Davies' voice in "Animal Farm" that makes this song unforgettable - particularly in this part:

'While I lay my head upon my pillow
Little girl, come play beneath my window
Though she's far from home
She is free from harm
And she need not fear
She is by my side
And the sky is wide
So let the sun shine bright' 

The build up to Davies screaming "She is by my side" is really breathtaking. The title track and "Starstruck" are just as excellent. This album is a real treat and should be in everybody's collection
