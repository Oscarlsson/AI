...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.
