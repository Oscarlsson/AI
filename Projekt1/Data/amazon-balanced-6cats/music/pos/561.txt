When I bought this cd I did not know that much about supergrass.  The only songs I had even heard were "pumping on the stereo" and "sun hits the sky" and I liked both of these songs a lot.  So while I was cruising the aisles in the record shop, my eyes caught a glimpse of Supergrass is 10, so I decided to buy it because it was at a great price, and I am glad I did.  The CD has not left my car since I bought it two months ago.

Every single one of the songs can get stuck in your head, and you won'tbe upset.  From the opening track "caught by the fuzz" to the finale "Wait for the sun" the album just rock throughout, and everytime I listen to it I want more.  The album clocks in at 71 minutes, but everytime I am done listenintg to it I feel unfulfilled.  That is a sign of a band making great music
