To start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd's that cover many years of there carrer.  This release is very good and worth buying.  it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with Branford Marsalis on the sax alone.  All and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd.  But i would also get something from the 77 era too
