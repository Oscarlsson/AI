Buy this CD now if you don't have it, it is an instant classic. The beats are banging, and fit Cougnut and C-Fresh's lyrics perfectly. The lyrics are tight, and touch on many different things. &quot;The Last Breath&quot; is real life song about death and injustice, and decisions we all have to make in life. &quot;Protect What You Hustle Fo&quot; is gangsta, about the individual struggle/hustle. &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; (remix) is even better than the West Coast Bad Boyz version with Master P. Its about real life in the ghetto
