Plain and simple...Cage is one of the best Underground rappers around.....And soon after Hell's Winter drops I think he will be accepted into mainstream......This CD is Cage at his craziest, the beats are hott, the rhymes are hot...BUY THIS CD....and if you like this CD buy some of his other CDs, Weatherproof, Night Hawks, Smut Peddler's : porn Again, The Leak Brothers: Water World, and Hell's Winter
