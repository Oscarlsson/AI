The Clean kick-started the illustrious New Zealand label Flying Nun in 1981, providing a key blueprint for indie-rockers from Australia (the Chills) to California (Pavement). Over this two-disc, 46-track set of rarities and essentials, the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the Velvet Underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited, rudimentary playing, shaky, Kiwi-accented vocals and endearing melodies. Disc one, as influential for the lo-fi sonics as for the songs, ends with the Clean's 1983 breakup. Disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996's Unknown Country, mining similar material with even more exciting (and even better-sounding) results. But by then, lots of bands were doing what the mighty Clean had helped pioneer.
