I bought this CD on a whim after I heard Joaquin Phoenix was directing their "Tired of Being Sorry" video.  Whoa!  I was addicted!  I couldn't stop listening to it...I had to get a 2nd copy for the car just so I could stop carrying it back and forth.  GREAT driving music!  The songs are catchy and have a great beat...I haven't heard anything this good in a long while.  I had to have more immediately and luckily found some earlier stuff of Scott Thomas'....more on the acoustic/indie side, but awesome!  I highly recommend Lovers & Thieves (CDbaby.com)  My faves from Ringside are "Struggle", "Trixie", and "Dreamboat 730". You will not be disappointed
