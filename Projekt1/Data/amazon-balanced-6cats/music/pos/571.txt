Vet producer Don Was is aboard for this one and he pushes the Ladies to write some of their most mature material, relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather than a sole ingredient. The result is that even the radio tailored material is better than on "Stunt".

Best tracks here are: lovers sparring in "Too Little Too Late", twangy "Go Home" (possibly the only time you'll hear a country tune with glockenspiel. Parental warning: this is one you'll want to skip if young ears are in the car because of a gratuitous F-bomb at the coda..), the tale of a co-worker dalliance in "Conventioneers" that ends with them feeling awkward about it ("So I wait, come in late, It'd be great if you transferred out of state"), the cheater finally caught in "Humour of the Situation" ("Have you heard the one about the boy who moved into the henhouse to sleep? He woke up with egg on his face, When he found that all the hens had crossed the street") and the ethereal "Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel", which utilizes an almost Disneyish melody in its tale of a man in a traffic accident who, disembodied, surveys his own demise ("In all the confusion, there's something serene, I'm just a posthumous part of the scene").

The least interesting tracks are "Off the Hook", another cheater gets him comeuppance tune and "Baby Seat", a gentle nudge to accept responsibility instead of wanting others to look after you.  

Bottom Line: While not as consistently fabulous as "Gordon", this one hits on all cylinders more than it misses and it utilizes more of the band's talents by allowing more lead vocals from Ed Robertson ("Pinch Me","Falling for the First Time"), as well as Kevin's first on the hidden track "Hidden Sun". 

You also hear the Ladies do things they haven't before: Steven's flute on "Tonight's the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel", Tyler's 808 drums for "Off the Hook", and a dash of retro courtesy of Ed's wah-wah pedal on "Conventioneers" and Kevin's vocoder on "Humour of the Situation"
