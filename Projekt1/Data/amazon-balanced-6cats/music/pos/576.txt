What a wonderful and diverse CD.  Sit in front of a fire on a rainy day with a nice glass of Oregon Pinot Noir in your hand.  Close your eyes relax and let the sounds of Liebert surround you.  His talent is evident in the expressions as he's playing.  The guitar seems an extension of his own form, not a separate instrument.
