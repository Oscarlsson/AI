This album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds.  The legendary Khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the Sufi music by playing more with his (brilliant) vocal skills then with the lyrics.  Micheal Brooks' music stands out and enhances the experience further.  This is not to say that the mainstream Indo-Paki audience won't enjoy this album ( This is one of my all time favs).  It is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things... :) 

For those who have been thinking of testing out Sufi music, this is the place to start.  This is a fine introduction to the great NFAK and Sufi music.
