Despite the excellent screenplay by Sam Shepherd and the solid acting by Harry Dean Stanton, I found "Paris, Texas" a rather unimpressive film, and the only thing that kept it together for me was Cooder's astounding soundtrack. The music here is simple, yet very moving and even haunting. His guitar stylings really captured the mood and feel that the film was otherwise supposed to convey. It seems to seep right out of the desolate landscape of the Southwest. Every time I listen to this CD it reminds me of driving along some deserted highway in Nevada, SE California, etc. Also, it's really nice that the soundtrack contains the story ("I Knew These People") told by Stanton's character, since to me that was the best part of the movie. Even so, seeing "Paris, Texas" is not a prerequisite for enjoying this CD, the music is phenomenal in its own right
