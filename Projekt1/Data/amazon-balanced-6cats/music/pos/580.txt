The first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it's almost impossible to say one is better that the others. Taken together, they are almost like one long album. The Family That Plays Together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity. Their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first. Randy California's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well. One thing that differd Spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert. I saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me. It's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later Ed Cassidy/Randy California version. Not that the later versions of the band weren't great - they just weren't quite as good as the original band. If your'e just being introduced to Spirit, The Family That Plays Together is a fine place to start
