I remember hearing of this band when I was just a lad, but I never owned any of their albums, and none of my closest friends played this for me, so this is a great discovery for me. I'm only on my second listen, but it's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite. It's from my favorite rock period, the early seventies, and it's not only nicely remastered, it's also remixed, meaning they went back to the original multi-tracks, not the stereo master. I wish more reissues were done this way
