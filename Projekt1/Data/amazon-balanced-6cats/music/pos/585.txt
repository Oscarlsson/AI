If you want to learn about Texas music just buy this disc.  Tom's love of life and artist's eye infect every song.

The opening number "Tonight We Ride" is hard to beat.  He sang it on David Letterman's show (Paul Shaffer played the accordian!).  Letterman described it as a "song that will make you want to saddle up a horse, ride up to Connecticut and rob a liquor store." Me, I just went out and bought some good Reposado Gold. Letterman's got a point, though- the songs on this disc will move you one way or the other.  

My other favorites are Bucking Horse Moon, and All This Way for a Short Ride.  Tom Russell is true American artist like Woody Guthrie or Pete Seeger, and this is one of his best.
