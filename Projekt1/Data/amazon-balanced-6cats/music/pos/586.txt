IF YOU LIKE BEATLES, MONKEES AND THE WHO, THEN YOU WILL LIKE THE GROUP THAT IS BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM ; THE RASCALS ! "LONELY TOO LONG" IS A SAD ROCK POP PAINFUL STAPLE IN YOUR 60'S ELBOW...IT HURTS...THEN THERES ALL THIS OTHER GOOD SH*** HERE...AND I DON'T MEAN GROOVIN ! THE HARMONYS AND THE KILLER KEYBOARDS AND TIGHT DRUMMING IN THESE LITTLE POP ANGRY YET CHEERFUL NUGGETS IS WHERE ITS AT !...I CAN REMEMBER LISTENING TO THE RASCALS INTERMITENTLY WITH BLACK SABBATH AND THE STOOGES...AND I REALISED THAT ABOVE ALL...I LIKED MY RASCALS RECORD THE MOST BACK IN 1987 UP IN THAT COLD LONELY BEL AIR GARDENING CABODE ! ALSO KNOWN AT TIMES AS 'THE YOUNG RASCALS' BUT TO ME...THIS BAND WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE FROM WAY BACK IN CHILDHOOD THAT GOT ME LISTENING TO QUEEN AND THE WHO LATER ON........ITS HARD TO SAY THAT THEY ARE UNDERRATED SINCE IN ANY GIVEN CONVERSATION, YOU REALISE THE RASCALS GET TONE OF RESPECT AND PEOPLE WILL TAKE OVER AND TALK ABOUT THEM ; FIVE STARS...BUY THIS THING
