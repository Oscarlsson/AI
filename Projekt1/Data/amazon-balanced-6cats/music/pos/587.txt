Fluke's latest album had been long in coming, and plagued with issues (word on the grapevine is one of the trend-setting trio left some point during production).  Still, years after their masterpiece Risotto, Fluke has returned intact and delivered another album, the oddly titled Puppy.

Puppy is for the most part a dark album.  It's clearly the evolution of the track Absurd (off Risotto) and its particular taste of big beat techno, with numerous tracks featuring similarly styled lyrics and vocals.  The sound has been expanded with touches of industrial guitars and beats that would sound right at home in Prodigy's Fat Of The Land or at a Nine Inch Nails concert.  The opening Snapshot shows this most evidently.  The album takes up a rave feel with the tracks Another Kind Of Blues (a remix of the stellar number Zion featured in The Matrix Reloaded and its soundtrack) and Hang Tough, which flow into each other and result in a mesh of old-school rave beats with new-school industrial grooves.  YKK is a wicked track that would easily be at home in a big-budget spy or action flick, while Expo is a sweeping and epic song.  Blue Sky is as close to an uplifting number you'll find on the CD, with a full choir used in the song's chorus.

Compared to Risotto, Puppy inevitably comes up short.  Like BT's Emotional Technology, Puppy has the misfortune of being the follow-up album to a complete and utter masterpiece (Puppy to Risotto, Emotional Technology to Movement In Still Life).  And let's face it: it's hard to surpass yourself when release an album that's nigh-perfect.  Still, I wasn't sure what to expect with Puppy and I found myself pleasantly surprised.  It's darker and meaner, but it's an overall rock-solid album, and fans of the grittier side of Fluke (Absurd, Atom Bomb) will likely be pleased with Puppy
