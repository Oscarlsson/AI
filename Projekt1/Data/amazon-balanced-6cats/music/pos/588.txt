I recently decided to go through some of my old cds that I haven't listened toin ages. Dj Cheb i Sabbah's Maha Maya: Shri Durga Remixed&quot; was one of those cds that I came upon. This was my first exposure to Indian music, let alone world music. I wasn't really familiar with music outside of western culture. So this was a new experience for me. Listening to &quot;Maha Maya&quot; Shri Durga Remixed&quot; certainly takes the listener on a trip to India with its traditional Indian melodies. I envisioned myself in the Taj Mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing. The music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me. It is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album. I however dug Transglobal Underground's version of &quot;Kese Kese&quot; (Where's the Sarangi Mix&quot; right from the get go. It has a nice beat. Dj Cheb i Sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together. I am definitely curious to hear dj Cheb's other cds now that I have re-discovered this little gem of a cd
