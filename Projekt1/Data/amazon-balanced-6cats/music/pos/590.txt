This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way.  This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix.  I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off.  Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals.

Two solid tech house tracks follow, especially Touane's snappy track Bassic, and it's right into the gritty, churning, techno sound of Thomas Schumacher's incredible track Rotor.  The mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7, which I feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix.  It's not bad, it's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking.  It's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row, and right after the melodic Freefall, it's into Tiefschwarz's own remix of a Depeche Mode track.  This is the only other slight miss in the mix for me, as I feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes, and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix.  Another solid melodic track is next, and we end with the dubbed out vocals of Kate Wax.

Overall, it's an exciting tech house mix that's a full lineup of solid tracks, with not a bad one in sight, and very few dips in the scorching pace of one, very sound, top to bottom mix.  Do not miss picking this one up, as it's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this year
