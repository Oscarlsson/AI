this is what music is all about, the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note, or the raspy, delicious vibrato of vocalist David Sylvian; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure. think if Tweaker were to make jazz--and really chill out--this is what it would sound like. you'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet, ever. there is everything one could want. possibly the perfect record. it's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul.

absolutely brilliant and definitely essential.  one of my favorites from the year.
