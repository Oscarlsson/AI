I'm not sure what took me so long to get it, but I'm just coming across this album.  It never made a blip on my radar I guess.  Anyway, I saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless (it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store).  Obviously the owner before me didn't know what they had on their hands and the store manager didn't know either due to it's low price tag.  Balance is a must have album without question.  It came out in '03, I'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh.  There are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review.  Of the 16 joints (including the bonus track), I'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing.  Akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap (even amongst underground emcees).  The songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same.  

I did mention that there were two songs that I could've done without.  Those songs are "Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Always Bet On Ak".  They aren't bad, but I find myself skipping them everytime I play this CD.

Balance is a must have LP.  I still feel a bit cheated since I just found out about this album.  There has to be some sort of promotion for this guy.  I did get the Black Dialogue (Perceptionists) album and I knew about The Lost Adats and The EP, but somehow I completely missed this one.  Don't be like me, if you haven't heard this yet, grab it as soon as you can.  You won't regret it.  This is one of the best albums on 2003.  Highly reccomended.
