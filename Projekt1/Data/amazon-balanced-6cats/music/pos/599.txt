A great series concept - highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the  American Music Library. Ofcourse the originally withdrawn [w. new  at-the-time Funky people] &quot;Talkin' Loud..&quot; by JB (I bought it  retail! ) is the highlight, along with the live  &quot;It's My  Thing...&quot; by Marva Whitney. (Yes, I saw MW sing it **l-i-v-e** at  Madison Square Garden in July, 1969). The prev. unrel. Bobby Byrd track and  Vicki Anderson's contribution to the &quot;Cold Sweat&quot; session also  reinforce the value for listeners
