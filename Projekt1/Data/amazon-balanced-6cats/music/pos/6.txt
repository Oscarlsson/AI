Review by Mike Watson:

With the recent slew of Victory Records releases, not to mention the wide variety; one can be to say the least skeptical of any of their assortment of new releases.  However, picking through all of the less notable releases from the label, the up-and-coming band, The Forecast, have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on Late Night Conversations.  The Forecast are a perfect blend of male and female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack, executed flawlessly over a ten song full length.

Late Night Conversations is an album confronting different topics ranging from relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing.  The harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping almost involuntarily. The Forecast is not only a great recorded band, but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage, with both great stage presence and cohesion as a band.  The Forecast will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music, and checking their Victory Records debut out is a must for fans of the genre.
