Attell is one of the few decent comics out there right now. I wasn't that big of a fan until I saw this in a record store and decided to give it a shot. I'm running out of comedy albums, there's not that many good ones out there. So I bought it and I was impressed. The audience is obviously drunken college kids who were very familiar with the show "Insomniac". They would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into his forehead the whole night. He has very good timing and delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines for the first time you are hearing them. You never see the punchline coming a mile away. He is vulgar so if you are sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity, stay away. He is one of the few that I enjoy now, tragically Mitch Hedberg died in March because he was another. The increasingly popular Dane Cook doesn't do it for me. Cook's Retaliation CD has broken all sorts of records for a comedy album. I think Cook is very marketable to the college, 20something crowd, guys like him because he's the loud obnoxious drinking buddy from the frat, chicks think he's cute. I recommomend Attell myself, he is vulgar but is just a better comedian
