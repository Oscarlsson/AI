I discovered this album some years ago as i'm workin' in big music stores i've got the opportunity to listen to so much music....well!! this album is a very difficoult one to find in a record store nowdays, and every time i have it in stock i play it straight away and some customer who listen to it buy it instantly,Blakey and Potato are swingin' so much in those &quot;salsa like&quot; rithms Mobley is -as usual with Art Blakey and K.D.- in such a great shape givin' a wonderfull touch to evry note he plays,basically one of greatest Blue Note of all time!
