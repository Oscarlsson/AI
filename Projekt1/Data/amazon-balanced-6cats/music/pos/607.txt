Leo Kottke is a national treasure.  He is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso.  Having said that, you'd expect his CDs to be at a very high level of brilliance.  I have at least a dozen of his titles.  If there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc, it's because there are so many Kottke releases to choose from.

"One Guitar, No Vocals" clearly ranks as one of the best.  The compositions tickle my brain, warm my heart, and put a bounce into my step.  The guitar playing is dazzling.  You really get a glimpse of the man behind the guitar by listening to this music - brilliant, thoughtful, odd, complex, quirky, a huge heart, and the wackiest sense of humor.  It's spirited music, so thoroughly drenched in the personality of its creator that it's unmistakably and immediately recognizable as Leo.  

The world is full of acoustic guitar instrumentalists these days.  Some of them are quite excellent.  Many are not.  But there is only one Leo Kottke.  And his guitar music is a gift to the world.

A very strong recommendation for this CD
