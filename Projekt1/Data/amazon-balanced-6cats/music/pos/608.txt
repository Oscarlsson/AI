I saw her perform most of these songs on Austin City Limits. I must admit I hadn't paid much attention to her since her debut album, back when I was playing in country bands.
Much of this material is kinda introspective, but hey, on the plus side you get great vocals, well crafted songs, tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who doesn't have to pretend she is anything she isn't. And these days, that is pretty refreshing!
I think I am becoming a fan
