umm...I don't think you quite got the point of this album. It is not about the artists that you like, it is about the artists that inspired Moore. Your ignorance forces me to do nothing but laugh. I find it funny that you feel you are making a point by saying "F*ck you SOAD" and so on. Have some respect for other's opinions. Unfortunately, you are a steriotypical "ignorant American".So with all that said, and with all due respect, I say, F*ck you pal
