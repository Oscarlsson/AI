It's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that XTC's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70's first wave of British punk rock. Those were different times, after all. You couldn't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky, spastic wit of &quot;White Music&quot;. Come to think of it, not many people could make much sense of it back then, either. Andy Partridge's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than &quot;pop&quot;, and Barry Andrews' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song. Nevertheless, the album worked. It rocked in its own art-damaged way, and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation. That lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the Fab Four's &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to &quot;This Is Pop&quot;. A few songs later Dylan's &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia. There may have been more intense punk artifacts from the Class of '78, but not many were anywhere near as smart as &quot;White Music&quot;
