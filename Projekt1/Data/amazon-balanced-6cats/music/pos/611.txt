Jeff Beck is the best guitarist on the planet and has been for a very long time.
What you get here is an abbreviated version of him live.
His song selection is not the best, but Freeway Jam which is one of my all time favorite Beck songs is included.
You also ger Scatterbrain and Blue Wind.
She's a Woman the old Beatles song is also included.
Jeff Beck at this time was playing some of his best guitar and his solo instrumental career was taking off.
The songs with the Jan Hammer Group to me are very average and infact distract what Beck is trying to to.

Unfortunately this is his only Live album from his instrumental era. I truely wish he would release a DVD of himself in concert for those who either havent seen him live or would like to see him live on DVD.
The idea was good, the Cd is too short and not up to snuff
