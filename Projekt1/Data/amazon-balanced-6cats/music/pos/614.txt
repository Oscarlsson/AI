I have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and I think it is superb!! I now know that the ALIEN movies rock! The tone of the music fits the movie. I especially like &quot; Ripleys Them&quot; Because it reflects on what has  happened with Ripley through-out the movie. The cloning, learing,  remebering and also meeting her clones. I would also like to say that the  movie was  excellent aswell. The cast did a great job, acting their hearts  out.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet should be proud of the music and his film.So if  you aren't an Alien fan, you sure as heck will be after you listen to the  soundtracks!               ~   Jenna
