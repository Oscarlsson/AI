Its a pretty good mix, good song choices, its mostly a harder mix, thought it could be smoother flowing though, but all in all its pretty good, also thought the robot walk to the party deal woulda made a better begining, it was a lot of down time during the middle of the cd, but hey people gotta switch it up now and then, like the last 3/4s better...
