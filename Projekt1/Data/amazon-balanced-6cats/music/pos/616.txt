Hard, smart, creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days.  Even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us, finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch.

Thankfully, "Secrets," under the usually readily available  Columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $9.99.  Should this be a hard decision? Emphatically: No.

Although I can see where previous reviewers are coming from, trying to compare this outing to Headhunters is truly unnecessary.  With this '76 effort Herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz, funk and disco but it all works.  "Doin It" is a super, super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the "Man-Child" sessions.  And although "Gentle Thoughts" can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album.  It's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and, as always,  Herbie dancing on the keys. 

Go get "Secrets," don't think about it.  It'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion
