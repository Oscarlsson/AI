For hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s, you can't do much better than Pat Benatar (and Heart) and this collection carries most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years: Heart Breaker, Hit me With Your Best Shot, Love is a Battlefield, Fire and Ice, Promises in the Dark.  But no Benatar collection is complete without 'Treat Me Right', 'You Better Run', and 'I Want a Lover who won't drive me crazy' (superior, in my opinion, to the John Mellencamp version), especially if you prefer Benatar's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads.   
Nevertheless, 'Best Shots' is a great place to start and certainly - at $10-15 versus $50 for the more complete 'All Fired Up' --  the best value for the money.
