Throb was my introduction to jazz back in '69 or '70.  I have
listened to it all of these years on LP then CD, and it never
lost its charm.  Steve Swallow was just as nutty then as he is now, "Chickens"
 is my favorite cut.  The play between electric
violinist Richard Greene and guitarist Jerry Hahn is a thing of
beauty. Hahn is still a player who can put just the right note
in just the right place (like that other countrified genius of
jazz Bill Frisell), he can fuzz and wah-wah then tinkle the
strings just right to make his musical point.  One interesting
thing is the organ playing by Burton on Throb, besides his vibes.
 The Jarrett-Burton album also has Hahn and Swallow, and drummer
Bill Goodwin --It is very much an album that shows all the new
ideas sprouting in music.  Fortunately, the ideas of that time
did not die out, but have continued to grow, making room for all
sorts of fusions in Jazz, many of which have been remarkable to
experience. These two-LPs-in-one is like having a Superstar
album before they became superstars.  As I said before, I
still play this CD after almost 35 years, and I still get a kick
out of it, and still find things that amaze me
