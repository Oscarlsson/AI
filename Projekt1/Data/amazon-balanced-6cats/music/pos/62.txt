I'm a huge Matchbox fan and I listen to a collection of all 3 albums ALL DAY long.  I never get tired of it!  Rob Thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me.  His lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me.  

What a great band!  What a great album!  What a great musical ride!
