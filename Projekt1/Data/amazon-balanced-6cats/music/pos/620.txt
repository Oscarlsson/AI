Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears.

Roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here. On Songs and Seeds, 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc, a sense of opening, progression, and completion; the 10 songs here have room to breathe, vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with "Goodnight".

As both Roland and Curt have matured, they have also mellowed. The anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone. And their latest album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing. But CDs don't age, so pick this sucker up. It really doesn't get much better
