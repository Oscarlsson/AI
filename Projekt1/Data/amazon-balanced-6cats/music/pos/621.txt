I have both the &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Seduction&quot; CD's by Oscar Lopez and listen to both of them with wonder.  This man is magic.  I have about 20 &quot;new flaminco&quot; CD's and these are right at the top as  far as my tastes are concerned.  Oscar, if you're listening, I check at  least once a month for your next one
