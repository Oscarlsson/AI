Quite different from his later big-band recordings. Some of the songs that you may find on Wes' 'BEST OF' collections sound too much like elevator music. Not so with this debut album. A drummer, a organist, and a guitar player; no horn section. Stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing. He shows of his trade mark octave playing, his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords none the less), and flashy runs across the fret board when needed. A good CD to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz.
