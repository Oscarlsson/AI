Five stars may be excessive if you judge this CD alongside the greatest classics, but when compared to similar CDs within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre, this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines.  I find myself coming back to this CD more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest.  The writing, while occasionally a bit awkward, is consistently interesting, honest and moving.  The themes of introspection, nostalgia,  regret, and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner.  The song "If I Were a Man" is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world; "Child of Steel" plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy; and "Take my Body" is a strong lament about the objectification of women.  I especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements; the simplicity really works with Ms. Cash's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments.  I've seen Ms. Cash perform live and, while she has other hits that may be more popular, this collection reveals her unique brilliance
