Even though Mitchell wanted to feel reckless in this album, she accomplished one thing with her music: coming closer to Weather Report.  It's obvious she loved its jazz-fusion and admired Jaco Pastorious and Wayne Shorter so much to have invited them to reach their peaks, but as master musicians they could only achieved what Joni allowed them to do. In "Paprika Plains" (a song over 16 min. long) Joni unloads wonderful lyrics but only allows her group of pioneers to explode at the last two and half minutes. I would have hoped to hear a longer and more robust instrumental finish worthy of Weather Report's reputation.  Over all the album is interesting because Mitchell is not afraid of going out on a very tiny limb....
