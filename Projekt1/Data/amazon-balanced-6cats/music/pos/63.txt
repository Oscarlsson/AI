This album is incredible.  For me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life.  An album that for months I played over and over.  An album that I've played countless times, that I have passed out to when I came home after a late night, that I have ran to, and worked out to, that I play at work for a pick-me up.  It's great.  It's filled with so much emotion and passion, from beginning to end its just brilliant, the entire album.  The songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams.  I love it.  You have to buy this album.  Then buy their next self titled album.  Then play it and play it, and play it.  It grows on you.  I can't wait to see them live...
