OK (I imagine there's still drool over my &quot;earlier&quot; review...and my wife is none too pleased either...) TRUTH OR DARE time! I bought this CD out of none-too-scientifical curiousity, that, and &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; - and guess what?  I'm beginnin' to dig the entire CD.  As I mentioned, 99 &amp; 44/100th% of &quot;rap music&quot; fully explains to me what Gregg Allman meant when he sang, &quot;It's not my cross to bear.&quot; OK, that being said, Eve pulls no punches (although the &quot;skits&quot; on the thing about wet myself laughing), and she's not a lady whom'd I'd like to cross.  But &quot;I bought the ticket, so I'm gonna take th' ride.&quot;  And enjoy myself mightily while doing so..
