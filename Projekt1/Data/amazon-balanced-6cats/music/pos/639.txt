This is an awesome EP Slayer owns all even when the production isn't that great. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shred fast as hell with their blazing fast riffs, Tom Araya's vocals are very hellish and gruesome and Dave Lombardo's drums are fast as well. This EP is Slayer at their prime and even if it's only four songs it's well worth the price. Below are my views on each song.

Chemical Warfare 100000000000001/10, Yes it is that awesome, this is a legendary Slayer song and a fan favorite. If you're gonna buy this for one song this is it, the lyrics are great and I love the riffs in this track.

Captor Of Sin 10/10, The opening of the song is great. The song is really good too. My second favorite on this EP as well.

Haunting the Chapel 7/10, I didn't really care for this song much, it's good but not mind blowing.

Aggressive Perfector 10/10, Slayer's first song ever, the opening sorta reminds me of Metallica's "Hit The Lights" but the song is very different though. A part of this song sonds like the guitars are making video game like noises. The vocals are also a little different from other releases but it's still awesome. 

Overall this EP was a great follow up to their debut. It also led to what the band would later become, thrash legends. A must have for fans and general metal fans alike. Highly reccomended
