One of the best Doobie collections out there "Greatest Hits" lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career. Some of the songs here are the single versions (meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions)and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs. Maybe it's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the CD. Either way fans may want to be aware of that.

In fact even on the boxed set we get "Listen to the Music", "Nobody" and "Rockin' Down the Highway" in their single incarnations. Perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio. Either way, fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import "Greatest Hits" collections or wait for the remastered CDs coming out later this year. This set does have one track not on the boxed set--"Without You" a great rocker. The CD booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently.

This definitely covers the highlights of the band's career whether it be the Tom Johnston rockin' years, Michael McDonald's blue-eyed soul stage or the band's reunion phase this has a bit of it all.  Personally, I would love to see a two disc distillation of the band's "Greatest Hits" with a second disc of album tracks such as "I Cheat the Hangman", "Losin' End", "The Captain and Me" and "How Do the Fools Survive?". In the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans. 

The sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by Bill Inglot for the boxed set. Detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued "Best of" pair to shame. This is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 "Nobody" to their last (when this compilation was put togetherin 2001) "Dangerous" released in 1991.
