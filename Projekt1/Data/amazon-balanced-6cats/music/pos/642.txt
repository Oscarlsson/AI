More like 3.5.
So. Half of this album is excellent. The rest is filler. But, due to "Times Like These", "All My Life", Disenchanted Lullaby (the intro irritates me but it gets better), "Have It All" (kinda sappy but I love the intro), "Low" (have you SEEN the video?) and "Overdrive" (again, kinda sappy but there's something about it I love), the album is pretty enjoyable. It doesn't compare to the first three, but it has its moments. The riffs are slightly heavier, most songs are pretty upbeat. "Times Like These" is an instant classic with awesome lyrics, while "All My Life" rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs. Kinda sucks how the best songs are/were singles, but if they had released other songs, no-one would buy the album. Mind you, my friend loves "Burn Away", so listen to the previews and make your own mind up
