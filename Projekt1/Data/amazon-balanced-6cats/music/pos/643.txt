I heard this music on the excellent P B S Documentary: &quot;Liberty - the American Revolution&quot; and I knew I had to have it! It is the finest music I have heard, capturing the heart and soul of the American Revolution. The documentary &quot;Liberty&quot; was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving. So too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment. I love it! I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. It framed the documentary (which I also bought) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting. Superlatives fail me. This music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the American Revolution and then by listening to it apart. This is some of the most wonderful music I have ever heard. It reminds me of the genius of Aaron Copland who wrote the Applachian Spring and Rodeo suites
