Very rich in music, fully orchestrated and full of energy. I highly recommend this album for everyone who loves New Age music and to all those who like Classical Music. David took it to another level on this one. I myself like New Age artists that incorporate Orchestra to their music and that is why I loved this album. If you like this album, I recommend you to explore Yanni, Secret Garden, Giovanni and Bernward Koch
