Solas' previous CD &quot;Words That Remain&quot; is a classic in Irish traditional music and the loss of Karan Casey certainly affects their sound on this album. However, instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and Deirdre Scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles. I don't think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music. The instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high. There are some lovely songs - i like &quot;Bonnie Mae&quot; and &quot;Miner's Life&quot; in particular and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; is an original gem. I am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of &quot;traditional&quot; music on the CD and about the use of &quot;rock&quot; instruments. Based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp, uillean pipes, wooden flute and fiddle (tin whistle (flageolet), guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, accordion and banjo being modern, foreign invaders)and what a pity! What defines traditional - is it pre-Planxty? Can no more traditional songs be written? Seamus Egan and Co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music (rhythm and melody) and have enriched it with a new chapter. In general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective. I would also highly revcommend Liz Carroll's &quot;Lost in the Loop&quot; although if you're a purist it has the Solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of Liz's &quot;brand new&quot; traditional tunes (brilliant)
