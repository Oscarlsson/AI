First off, I'd like to say that I am not a Country music fan, but I am a Johnny Cash fan. He transcends the genre that turned his back on him in his later years, but here the man can do no wrong. Now, I bought the 2000 "expansion" release of this concert which at the time was dubbed the "complete concert recording". It was misleading because I had seen the British documentary (the DVD of this is included in the set)in which Johnny &  friends were performing songs I never knew existed from this legendary event because they were absent on CD. Now this is the full sha-bang, complete with amazing packaging, the concert spread over two CDs, and the DVD mentioned above. If you bought the previous CD like I did, let me tell you, this is worth the upgrade as it seems this is the "definitive end to all release" of Johnny singing to the boys at San Quentin.

For new fans, the single CD release might be the best place to start since it has at least 85% of what Johnny sang that night at San Quentin. The rest of the legacy tracks feature The Carter Family, Carl Perkins, and The Statler Bros.

So if you're looking for a "Johnny Cash" solo concert, then get the single CD version. If you want the absolute complete version in a great package, 40 page booklet, and he Legendary British Documentary of this concert for the first time on DVD; The Legacy Edition of this memorable night is the way to go
