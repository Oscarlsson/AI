Mountain Music offers what Alabama is famous for, great music and great harmony all packaged together. The title cut is great, that harmonica and &quot;old man of the mountain&quot; intro is unique. As for &quot;Close Enough to Perfect&quot; if any man sings that song to his lady, she is his forever. The cuteness of &quot;Never Be One&quot; also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it. There isn't a bad song on the whole CD and will make a good addition to any collection
