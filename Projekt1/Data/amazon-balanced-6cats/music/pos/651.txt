This is a wonderful view into what is the best and worst about a Tedeschi concert.  She can be as soulful as the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness:  She just can't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs.  She's terrific on the ballads but isn't a good enough guitar player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to make do with her fabulous vocals.  She's got solid keyboards and vocals in support, so it's not apparent until half way through the gig.  But keyboards can't provide enough of an edge to the very few fast, upbeat songs and the whole concert lags.  Zzzzz by 2/3rds of the way through.  Look at the audience at the end of the concert when she plays a lethargic version of "I Fell in Love."  Very few people (besides the B3 player who has kept the only energy up through the show) are energized.

Put this DVD on when you're in bed with a glass a red wine with your loved one and the fireplace is going and it'll be terrific, at least until you fall asleep
