"The Passion of the Christ - Songs" is a fine collection of great songs, each in their own way a reaction to the spectacular film that Mel Gibson has created. The standouts are the song "I See Love" by Steven Curtis Chapman, Third Day an MercyMe; Scott Stapp's powerful solo debut song "Relearn Love;" "Rainy Day" by Big Dismal, and the emotional "New Again" by Brad Paisley and Sarah Evans.  Despite a couple of songs that don't reach their true potential ("The Passion," and "How Many Lashes"), this is a fine CD that belongs in anyone's and everyone's Christian music collection. Grade: A-
