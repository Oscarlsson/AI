Sorry, ya just can't replace Michael Hutchence. This is a great overview of all of their greatest hits.  I am not a huge fan of greatest hits CDs b/c people tend to buy them and, therefore, miss all of the excellent songs that weren't released as singles.  All INXS CDs are worth buying separately. But, if you must.....this will work
