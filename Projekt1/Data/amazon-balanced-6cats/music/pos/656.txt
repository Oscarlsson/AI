Miss Saigon is my favorite all-time musical!  I was hesitant when buying this recording because in my mind Lea Salonga is and always will be Kim!  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Joanna Ampil as Kim holds her own.  While she doesn't have the vocal range of Lea, she has a beautiful, crisp voice which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of Kim.  She expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love, pain and anguish and in turn she makes this part her own.  The rest of the cast is superb (especially the amazing Ruthie Henshall as Ellen) but make no mistake, this show belongs to Ampil!

I also fell in love with some of the material left out of the LCR.  There a beautiful bridges and songs which enrich the story.  "Back in Town" stands out for me because of the gorgeous melodies.  Anyone who has fallen in love with the story of "Miss Saigon" will appreciate these added gems!  This cast recording is definitely worth a listen!
