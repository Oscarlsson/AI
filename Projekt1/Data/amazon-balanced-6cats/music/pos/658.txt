Hands down, a 5 star, two thumbs up, classic joint.  After it dropped, Puba reigned supreeeme.  Disregard the Amazon reviewer, there are no "gaffes" in this one, period...  These guys were true to their beliefs.  They weren't packaging a product for "pop" consumption, they were telling a generation what THEY THOUGHT.  Check it out and the music will speak for itself.  The best track in my opinion was "Wake UP", but the whole album was great.  As someone else mentioned, fast tracks put it in the 90's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever.
