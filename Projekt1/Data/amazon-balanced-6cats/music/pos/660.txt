This is Roxys last gasp...I mean "wheres Eddie Jobson??" Actually this really a good recording, its just that the first 5 Roxy Music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection...anyway..with that said...I have NO IDEA why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of Angel Eyes, which is hard to find on CD. This, to me is really the last Roxy Music Album, because you just CANT have Roxy Music without Paul Thompson...sorry. I mean Avalon and the others are nice pieces, but they really should have been Bryan Ferry solo albums because Andy and Phil are really playing more as session players there
