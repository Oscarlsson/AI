I wonder if the two reviewers who said they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film? My guess is that they did not. The film was ENHANCED by the James Horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not light and subtle. It is a unique and amazing film and the score is a perfect match. By the way, the bigwigs at Universal nearly died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they asked Horner for the written score and he had to admit that none existed!

WONDERFUL MUSIC
