What can I say about Vince Gill that his many fans haven't already mentioned.  I had never been particularly interested in country music.  But, one day I was listening to a country radio station and Vince Gill was singing &quot;When Ever You Come Around&quot; and I was hooked. This CD is as consistant as all his others. Great lyics and superb musicianship. I rate this five stars as I believe Gill is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today
