Brilliant, glorious music--all of it, although I agree with those who have come to feel that the Ellington/Strayhorn version of &quot;The Nutcracker Suite,&quot; in particular, is an all-too-often-buried treasure that no Christmas season should be without (and if you can ignore it for the rest of the year, you have more willpower than I).  What happens to Tchaikovsky's marvellous music--and Grieg's, too--in these hands is creative homage of the highest order: the music is re-imagined from the inside, in wholly jazz terms, in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely reconceives the original.  What Balanchine did for Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky in dance, Ellington here does for Tchaikovsky and Grieg in another realm of music, and leaves us with works that deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older and better-known prototypes.  And to top it all off, you get Ellington and Strayhorn's own superb &quot;Suite Thursday.&quot;  Listen and rejoice
