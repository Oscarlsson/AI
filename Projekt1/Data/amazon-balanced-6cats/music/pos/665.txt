I love this album but the other review from Anonymous is wrong. this cd is not remastered. I baught this cd because of that review and got burned. The cd even says right on it AAD. in other words analog recording/analog master/digital playback. I will say this much though, the transfer is better than MCA's version which I own. However, If you want a remastered version of the song Monster look to the "All Time Greatest Hits/Original Recording Remasterd" cd From MCA. It also Has Move Over from this cd, I Love this cd and want it remastered. If you gotta have this album (I Do) than this version sounds better than the MCA version
