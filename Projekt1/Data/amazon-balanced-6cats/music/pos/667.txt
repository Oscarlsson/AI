This album has new meaning to me now in 2007, where I go to a college next to a high school, where I see a bunch of "punk rockers" spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness.  There are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of Social Distortion alive, but sometimes their music is hard to find, and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire.  Albums like this exist for times like those.  Just stick it in, turn up the volume, and rock out
