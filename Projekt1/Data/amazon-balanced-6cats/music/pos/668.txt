I felt compelled to write a review having read another written by someone who gave it one out of five stars.  I felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review, so here I am...

As a musician I could think of nothing more intimidating than attempting to cover a Buckley song.  Their fan bases are fiercely loyal and protective of their material.  So first things first I would like to congratulate the artists for their bravery.  Furthermore a quick glance down the list of performers will quell any suspicions that this is 'just another tribute record cashing in on someone else's success', these are musicians that know what they're doing.

What struck me the most was the variety of voices on this disc; you have the ethereal whisper of Sufjan Stevens, sweet folk harmonies of the Magic Numbers, the lazy drawl Micah P. Hinson.  Not only that, but these are great interpretations from the Jeff & Tim cannon.  Very inspired and innovative - a beautiful accordion riff on 'Grace' , an Irish-jig inflected 'No Man Can Find The War'...these artists do not desire to replace Jeff or Tim, they're merely reuniting us with what they left us - their music.
