I used to listen to a friend's copy of the original "Metal Box" of EP's, when it first came out.

Years later the "Second Edition" came out on LP's for those of us who hadn't sprung for the Metal Box before it sold out.

Eventually the Second Edition came out on this CD. So I finally could own a digital copy myself. Pristine, audio quality at least as good as the original Metal Box in my opinion, if I remember correctly.

You do need to listen to this. You do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too
