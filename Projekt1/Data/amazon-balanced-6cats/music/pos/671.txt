I get the sense that The Fleetwoods'body of recorded work isn't given the respect it deserves. Over the course of their career, the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection, as good as it is, is pretty much all that's out there on cd, save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground. Rock and roll has always had a soft side and it's in this area that the Fleetwoods really shine. Their cover of Thomas Wayne's &quot;Tragedy&quot; is an evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-I can't put it any other way. Maybe that's the reason why the Fleetwoods are given short shrift today: they're the perfect embodiment of a (then)nascent teen culture's soft and gentle side.This collection features all of their hits, some well chosen album tracks and the original pre-overdub version of &quot;Come softly to me&quot;. If you like this recording, try looking for their original lps. (My personal favourite is the 1963 &quot;Goodnight my Love&quot; album.
