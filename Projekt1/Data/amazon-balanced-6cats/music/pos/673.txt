I don't like this album as much as their earlier stuff. I have liked each release less than the previous, and this one falls right in line with that trend. The opener &quot;Quality Revenge . . .&quot; is one of their best songs hands down, though. This is a very good CD, but the farther from Braid we get in time the less I seem to like their music
