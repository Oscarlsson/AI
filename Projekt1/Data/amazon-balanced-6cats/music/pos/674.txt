My first Monk album was Monk's Dream from Columbia.  I loved that album 15 years ago and had been searching for the same satisfaction from the multitude of Monk recordings from the Blue Note Years, Presitge, and Riverside.  What Monk's Dream offered that the prior work lacked, was production.  Raw, edgy, spontaneous ...yes all those recordings offered that.  But I longed for that sense of confidence, tightness and richness of sound Monk's Deream provided.  I found that in this set which makes sense since Monk's Dream came out of these sessions at Columbia.  So what if these are reworks of the old stuff...they sound just as new and gripping &quot;produced&quot; as they did in their earlier days without big money helping out.  WIll I throw out my older stuff and just play this? No chance..there is a time for polish and a time for purity
