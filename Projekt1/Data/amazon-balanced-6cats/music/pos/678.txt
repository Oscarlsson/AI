I admit when I listened to this album I was blown away by the powerful content of Kenny G's music. I was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during  the movie. Kenny G's music is perfect for this kind of movie. Not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show. This is the perfect soundtract for the movie Dying Young because it just simply shows the real mood in the movie
