That Nigga's Crazy and Bicentennial Nigger both surpass this album in laughs, but it would still rank high if it wasn't for the poor sound quality--there's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly  than Pryor himself half the time.  But some great classic bits, and believe  me you're never bored
