Michelle Branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with Carlos Santana.  This record is her first with friend Jessica Harp.   The ladies mine the borderline between the singer/songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format.

Highlights include the opening track Leave the Pieces, Way Back Home, The Good Kind, and the title track Stand Still Look Pretty.  Of special note is the presence of producer/multi-instrumentalist John Leventhal on many tracks.

I recommend this record for folks who like songs that don't sound like formula country
