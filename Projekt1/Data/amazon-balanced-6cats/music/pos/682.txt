I can't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album.  Not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless.  Very hurtful.  Lousy counterpoint to her warmth.  I don't think they understand that she doesn't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching.  Take her as an original instead of as a mimic.  What do I hear?  I love her lush voice on this album and Fred Hersch's brilliant piano accompaniment.  Bill Frisell is very good, too.  I love jazz & pop as well as opera.  Ren?e Fleming can make it any of these genres. These songs are very much her own interpretation.  They are 'deeper' than what you've heard before.  Even if I prefer Nancy Wilson or Eva Cassidy singing "You've Changed," Ren?e Fleming sings it warmly and beautifully, in her own style, and very touching, too.  She's not carried by full orchestration, mostly just Fred and her.  I was going to write that "My One and Only Love" was especially good, but as the cd kept playing, I must say that they are all especially good.  Enjoy
