When a young artist names her first two albums not &quot;Judy&quot; or &quot;Collins&quot; but &quot;A Maid Of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Golden Apples Of The Sun&quot;,you know she takes herself seriously.Originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were all I knew until I saw this CD recently.&quot;Who will buy this?&quot; I wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me.The comparisons with first two Baez albums are inevitable (some songs were recorded by both) althought Collins shows much more passion and involment where Baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.On these early albums Collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain (to some ears,overpowering) seriousness,cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous &quot;O Daddy Be Gay&quot;,a cousin to her &quot;Grandfather&quot; recorded years later.Althought I honestly love these songs and listen only this CD for days,these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of Collins later trademarks (voice will soar much higher in the future,she slipped W.B.Yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer) and as they were product of their Greenwich Village times,they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.But they are still hauntingly beautiful to me,I waited their re-release for too long
