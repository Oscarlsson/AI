Excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic Dutch band. Each tune was a single sometime between 1965-69. These guys are NOT to be confused with a U.S. band from the same era of the same name. Cuts that make this CD a true keeper are "Sun's Going Down", the tripping "Feel Like I Wanted To Cry", "Keep On Trying", the familiar sounding "Touch" and "Ballad Of John B". This is yet ANOTHER band I've heard at least one or two tracks on the Rhino release of 'Original Artyfacts: Nuggets II' 4-CD box set.Should appeal to fans of Pretty Things,Q65,early Beatles,Creation and The Action.A must-have
