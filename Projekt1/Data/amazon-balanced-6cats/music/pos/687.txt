Ms. Melua is from Georgia.  Her voice is quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl.  Neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse.  Both have musical partners.  In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes songs.  Most of this album are her and/or his songs.  They are well written and well treated.  They are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners.  Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago.

The original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition.  But my favorite cut is her rendering "Blues in the Night", which some might remember from Looney Tunes cartoons many decades past; "My mama done tole me..." it starts.  Knowing she cannot belt it, instead she works it.

One short note on Steve Sale's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all, clipping.  Perhaps because I bought it on vinyl, but I hear none of these defects.  My set is revealing, and it reveals excellent engineering, considering the largeish ensemble Mr. Batt has assembeled.  Fear not, unless the CD really is badly made
