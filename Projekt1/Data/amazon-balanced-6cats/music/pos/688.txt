Watching the Melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining. They began as an unassuming punk band, and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70's rock into their sound. Then they stripped away any and all of the "punk" trappings and went for pure HEAVY. It all culminated with this record. It just doesn't get any heavier than 'Roman Bird Dog/Hung Bunny'. 'With Teeth', rumored to actually be written by Joe Preston, is one of my all time favorite Melvins songs. Speaking of Joe Preston, he was the by far best of the Melvins' 7000+ bassists they had over the years. Shame they got rid of him shortly after this album. As soon as they fired him, they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity Hell. Bad karma. Thank God that rock bands record their music so that it isn't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions. The only song on this record which I don't like is the cover of Alice Cooper's 'The Ballad of Dwight Fry'. Thankfully they made up for it with a cover of Flipper's 'Sacrifice'. 

Some of the Melvins' subsequent records have their moments (Stoner Witch's 'Shevil', Stag's 'Cotton Mouth'), but for the most part it seems to me that the Melvins gave up the ghost after recording this. Maybe someday they'll make a comeback
