What a great album this is, not only is the music a real pleasure to listen to, but the lyrics are a hoot! Wayne is not afraid to experiment, he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way. The songs pull you right in as if your listening to an old favorite you haven't heard in a long time. This album instantly became one of my favorites. I bought two more to give as gifts.
