I am a Motown,Oldies,R&amp;b,Soul,Love Songs, music Lover.I like the songs  that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings back memories that come  alive to the rhythem and Bill Withers definately fits right in there. I  don't realy have a favorite artist because I like sooooo many of them but  if I had to pick my top 10, this album would be in there
