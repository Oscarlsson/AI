I just saw the movie and throughly enjoyed the performance by all the actors involved.  Kevin Spacey has a velvety, smooth voice.   I was surprised to learn his background is in musicals.  He has a beautiful voice and in this movie, it rocks!!!  Love the music!  I highly recommend you buying the CD and the DVD
