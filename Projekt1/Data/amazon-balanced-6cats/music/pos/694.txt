Julieta Venegas did it again. She scored an album that is not alternative in style, however it is very catchy pop music. Her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on. You can sing along and express day to day feelings. Julieta continues to use instruments I like such as the harmonica. And of course, Julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances. My personal favorite is "Me voy", a very positive song about a not so positive event, breaking-up. Keep up the good work, Julieta. Your songs are appreciated.
