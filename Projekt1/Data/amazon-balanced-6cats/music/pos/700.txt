It all started when I was a little kid and my dad gave me this album (he wasn't a fan, he probably picked it up with a crate of used records.)  It was one of my first exposures to rock and roll.  Nearly 30 years later I still own the original vinyl (the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover.)  I am glad to have it now on CD, the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable.  I dissent the reviewers who praise DuCann over Crane, for really, it IS after all Vincent Crane's project (Crane, also organist for Crazy World of Arthur Brown.)  A keyboard player myself I consider Crane one of my biggest influences and I hold great admiration for his playing.  DuCann and Hammond also deserve praise for their performances, but it should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock band is: Um, the audience ... er, no the organist!  Take a trip back in time and enjoy this classic work
