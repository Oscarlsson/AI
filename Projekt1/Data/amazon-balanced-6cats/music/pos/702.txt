Adios Marks the real goodbye from KMFDM.  After they went on to do MDFMK which was decent and then they came back.  Attak, was really weak because it was all Sascha and Skold and though I like them both, the absence of Gunter Schulz and En Esch really made this album absent in itself.  WWIII though it is a better and pretty decent album, KMFDM is still a little less present.  
   Adios gives us the remnants of what KMFDM fans know as KMFDM with Skold present but not taking over completely (Though I like Skold, But we need a break) We saw Nina Hagen lend her voice in "Witness" which is amazing, along with Ogre from Skinny Puppy in "That's All" and "Full Worm Garden" great tracks
A little bit of Pig and Schulz's insane guitar riffs and you are all set. Even though En Esch was very minimal in the recording, infact I barely remember him...  Currently Working on "FUBAR", we'll see if KMFDM will impress again, They have it still, they are just not using their talents as of late, C'mon Sascha, you're great man, but get over yourself and get Schulz and Esch back... Bring back KMFDM... What would Skinny Puppy be without Cevin Key? what would Ohgr be without Ogre? What would Foetus be without Thirlwell? c'mon man.. Bring us back KMFDM...
