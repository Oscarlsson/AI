My 8-month-old son and I listen to this CD every night, and by the Pachelbel Canon (track 7) he's usually sound asleep.  It is NOT ALL SYNTHESIZER.  The jacket clearly states that the "Music Box Orchestra" includes flute, piano, cello, percussion, english horn, and oboe.  As a musician, I am not offended by the "easy-listening" versions of these classics.  In fact, I enjoy them.  They introduce my son to the timeless melodies WITHOUT OVERSTIMULATING HIM at bedtime.  I find them relaxing too
