This CD was well worth the wait!  It contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years.  I took one of the CDs out of the box, put it in the player, and within minutes my wife and I were dancing.  The sound quality, in my judgment is solid, the packaging is fun and creative, and the booklet containing the Cameo Parkway "story" was an interesting read.  There will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included, but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era.  What great fun to hear the Orlons, Chubby Checker, The Tymes, The Dovells, Bobby Rydell, and Dee Dee Sharp once again.
