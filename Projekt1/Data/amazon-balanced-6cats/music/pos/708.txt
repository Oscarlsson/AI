Chandos' Grainger Edition is a significant contribution to modern art.

This particular volume (Vol. 14) features Grainger's settings of various folk and popular songs which he made in the first quarter of the 20th Century.  The accompaniments are set for small ensembles, and Grainger utilized the harmonium on many of the song settings on this disc.
