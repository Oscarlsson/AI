This is Jeff Beck's best album.  A masterpiece of guitar work.  This is an all instrumental album that features what Jeff does best - play guitar.  The supporting band is excellent especially the drum work.  Production quality is excellent as well.  While I wouldn't consider JB a blues guitarist I would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this album show cases why.  A great companion album to Blow by Blow is Wired.  It's a shame that after Wired his record company made him go back to albums with vocals.  He has on a roll and at a level that he has rarely gotten back to. If you like guitar and can live without vocals buy this album. You will not be disappointed
