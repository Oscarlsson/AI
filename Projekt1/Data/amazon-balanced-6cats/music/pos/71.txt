Just wonderful, wonderful!  Even if you haven't seen the movie buy the music...so lovely and refreshing...of course, there is no one like Van Morrison (always and forever a 5-star), he tops the all-time charts for me...Kevin Kline is so smooth with La Mer...and the rest of the music is soulful and enchanting...you just can't miss with this one
