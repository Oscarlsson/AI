Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  This album is one prime example of why.  David has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics.   His last album was a country album called &quot;Love Is Always  Seventeen,&quot; which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country,  co-produced and performed with Billy Dean.  But back to this gem.   &quot;Guitar Man,&quot; and &quot;Aubrey&quot; were the big hits off of  this album, and they still stand the test of time.  &quot;Tecolote&quot; is  one of their most unusual departures, and still makes me laugh, while  enjoying its musicality and orignality.  &quot;Didn't Even Know Her  Name&quot; is a poignant lost love song; &quot;Welcome to the Music&quot;  is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to  what to expect.  Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the  intriguing &quot;Picture in My Mind.&quot;  It's a great album---in fact,  there's not a bad &quot;Bread&quot; album out there!  Enjoy, and relive  those magical moments of the glorious seventies
