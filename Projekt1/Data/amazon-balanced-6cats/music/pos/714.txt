   Like many before me,this "blue" Beatles best-of served as my first,in-depth sampling of The Beatles' output from their post-'Revolver' era from early-1967 onward... You couldn't find a better 100+ minutes of music to listen to straight through than the superb 28 tracks that make up 'The Beatles 1967-1970'. I bought this initially back in the winter of 1988 (I was 18 at the time) on cassette,and it changed my life. True; the 2-cd version often retails at $34.00,which is a bit much,but the material contained is beyond priceless.. About the songs. The songs!! There's not a lame one among the batch of 28. What's even cooler is that -even as the songs unfurl chronologically- they pack a flow to rival any of anyone's favorite best-of albums... The flow of all 28 is remarkable... A fantastic mix of all their late '60's #1 hits as well as choice album cuts ("A Day In The Life","I Am The Walrus")... Seriously folks; anyone who is feeling the itch to discover The Beatles' later output should get this "blue" best-of first,then graduate onto the studio albums themselves.. That's what happened to me and I wound up (so far) buying all of the albums from 'Rubber Soul' (1965) onwards... This blue '1967-1970' never disappoints. Because the liner notes/inlay booklet doesn't tell you which album each track is culled from,I'll happily fill you in:

Disc One:

1.)Strawberry Fields Forever(John in vocals)
2.)Penny Lane(Paul on vocals)
(Both originally released as a stand-alone single in early 1967 and both served as the first tracks recorded for what would be 1967's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". However,the two songs weren't released on any Beatles' album until late-1967's 'Sgt. Pepper' follow-up 'Magical Mystery Tour'.)

3.)Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band(Paul on vocals)
4.)With A Little Help From My Friends (Ringo on vocals)
5.)Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds(John on vocals)
6.)A Day In The Life(John and Paul on vocals)

3-6 from the legendary 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'; 1967.

7.)All You Need Is Love (John on vocals)
8.)I Am The Walrus(John on vocals)
9.)Hello,Goodbye(Paul on vocals)
10.)The Fool On The Hill (Paul on vocals)
11.)Magical Mystery Tour(John on vocals)

7-11 from 'Magical Mystery Tour'; 1967

12.)Lady Madonna(Paul on vocals)
13.)Hey Jude(Paul on vocals)
14.)Revolution(John on vocals)

12-14 all stand-alone singles released in 1968. All were/are
huge hits. Sweet!

Disc Two:

1.)Back In The U.S.S.R.(Paul on vocals)
2.)While My Guitar Gently Weeps(George on vocals)
3.)Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da(Paul on vocals)

1-3 taken from 1968's double-album 'The Beatles' (aka "The White Album").

4.)Get Back(Paul on vocals) (Originally recorded 1969 as a single and not released on album until 1970's 'Let It Be'. Twistedly,'Let It Be' was recorded prior to 1969's final Beatles' studio album 'Abbey Road',but not released until later...)

5.)Don't Let Me Down(non-album b-side to the "Get Back" single; John on vocals)
6.)The Ballad Of John And Yoko (non-LP stand-alone single; John on vocals. One of the very few Beatles tracks recorded with only John and Paul playing all the instruments..)
7.)Old Brown Shoe(b-side to "The Ballad Of John And Yoko"; George on vocals)

All of the hits plus some choice b-sides as well.. Yeah!!

8.)Here Comes The Sun(George on vocals)
9.)Come Together(John on vocals)
10.)Something(George on vocals)
11.)Octopus's Garden (Ringo on vocals)

(All culled from 1969's *true* final Beatle masterpiece,'Abbey Road')

12.)Let It Be (Paul on vocals)
13.)Across The Universe(John on vocals)
14.)The Long And Winding Road (Paul on vocals)

12-14 from 1970's (actually recorded early 1969) 'Let It Be'.


So there you go... 28 of THE very best music ever to grace the world... (Seriously.) Please do yourself a favor and check out *any* Beatles' music. But a choice place to start certainly is here. Have Fun/Enjoy/Peace!

Thanks for your time.
