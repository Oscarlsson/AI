This is a great Movie Soundtrack!. I'm a PASSPORT Fan since I was a kid back in the 70's. I have all Klaus Doldinger's official releases with his Passport signature. Please go and look for this CD "Running In Real Time" from Passport and listen to track number 2: Auryn. Then go and get all his Passport releases (almost 20 CDs since the 70's). Then you will see why Klaus Doldinger is very creative
