Though I am only 33 years old, I grew up listening to Bob Wills.  Merle Haggard did a great job with this one (as he always does).  I got goose bumps listening to it.  It took me back to my childhood when I would sit on  the porch with my Grandfather listening to Bob Wills.  The only thing  missing is the scratching of the needle on a nearly worn-out album
