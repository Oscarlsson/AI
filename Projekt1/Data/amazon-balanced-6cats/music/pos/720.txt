This is just a great CD. Whenever I need to restore inner harmony after work, or dealing with any upsetting situation, this is the one I go to. Instantly I am transported to the calm, soothing setting of a traditional Japanese house and garden. It is fantastic for meditation, too. Let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording
