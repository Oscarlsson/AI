Metheny's an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles, moods, textures, and sounds.

Here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective, wide-open-spaces musical journey across America, weaving in jazz, folk, country, rock, mountain music, and everything in between.  If you love his work on Joni Mitchell's Amelia (performed live on Shadows and Light), you'll love the sound of this record.

The mood is mellow but not dull, quiet but not silent, and the results are spectacular.  This is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier, or a short hop to Burger King.  Works either way
