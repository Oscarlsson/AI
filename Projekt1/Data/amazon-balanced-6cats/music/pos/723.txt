      Tame's music is all about the beat. It's what got me right from the start, a grinding, repetitious backbone to every song. Tame One rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery. Tame gets rid of the verse-hook standarda, periodically ad-libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing. Its an amazing album well worth purchasing.
