while i am not a big fan of john mcLaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i cannot deny that they really had something with this album.. It is something new - not just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new territory...  There is a cohesiveness amongst the band members - of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion but first of all it is music
