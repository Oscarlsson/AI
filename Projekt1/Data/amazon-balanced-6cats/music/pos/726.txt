I cannot stop listening to the song I Saved The World Today.  The CD is worth the price for this song alone.  The whole CD is great though ... classic Eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work.  Annie Lennox gets all the attention ... and she deserves every bit, but Dave Stewart certainly deserves as much.  They make a great team and this CD should have been given much more attention in the USA.  I hope they don't take so long to do another one
