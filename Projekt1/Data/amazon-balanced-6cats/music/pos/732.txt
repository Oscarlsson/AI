This is an amazing EP - one of Boards of Canada's strongest to date. Honestly, I didn't enjoy Dayvan Cowboy that much on Campfire Headphase, but since it has been recontectualized on Trans Canada Highway, I'm a huge fan of the song. The new tracks are more like what one would typically expect from Boards of Canada. Warm, fuzzy, mellow, lush analogue synths and plenty of them! For those who weren't as taken with the newer BOC sound on Campfire Headphase, assuage your fears - this is definitely a return to the traditional sound. That's not to say though that this is a rehash of old material. One can hear bits and pieces of Geogaddi and such, but the overall feel is much closer to Music Has the Right to Children. To all Boards of Canada fans - buy this without hesitation. It doesn't matter what you thought of Campfire - this is quality.

I have one question. The title, Trans Canada Highway, seems to be a fairly obvious reference to Kraftwerk's legendary Trans Europe Express and the album cover seems to point to Kraftwerk's Autobahn album cover, but I don't hear any explicit musical connection. Is Boards of Canada paying a simple titular tribute to Kraftwerk, or is there something else buried within? This calls for repeated listenings
