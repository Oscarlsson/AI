Those who liked Suede may be looking for more of the same from The Tears, but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from Brett, and the familiar wailing of Bernard's guitar, this marks a watershed in their repertoire. The most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as 'hits' (much more radio-friendly, and why not?). It's also a more mellow sound than Suede (there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the Tears concert I attended). Another important difference is the guitar work, with Bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since Reeves Gabrels and Tin Machine. Among the better songs are Apollo 13, Brave New Century, Refugees and Co-Star. Though Brett and Bernard are capable of better, this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised Suede-heads, and I recommend you turn it up loud
