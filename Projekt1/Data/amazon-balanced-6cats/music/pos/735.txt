I was in Walmart's electronic area (which is where you can usually find me!) and I saw the album. I heard Unbelieveable and I was sold on that song but couldn't find the single. The album on first listen was not my favorite, but after a while I started liking it. It is a great album and I'm glad I bought it. Talent is a virtue!
