This is one of my favorites of 2004.  You got a seasoned vet of an MC rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats(madlib, j-zone, dangermouse) and some pretty nice guest appearances.  I have a couple of complaints on this album though, like the song "Love Thang", the hook is wack and the beat is corny, another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got Prince Po sounding Like Tonto from Lone Ranger chanting some indian ish, and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like "and if the girl farts then she's a pooter"??? thats dumb.  One last complaint then i'm done hatin, but the chorus on Bump Bump is terrible, and i'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i'm in my car because it sounds so wack, but Raekwon's verse takes me back to when Wu Tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90's, which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus.  Aside from those complaints you got a dope album, J-Zone hit this up with some of best beats i've ever heard from him.  So pick this up its definitely a good purchase
