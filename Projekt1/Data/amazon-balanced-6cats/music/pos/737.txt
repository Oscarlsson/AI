Sometimes I like to look up and see what I can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70's and Starz being one of them. I was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78. Another band that took time for their fans!!!!!!!
I read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that I can add, also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music. I would recommend reading about each of the Starz cd's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself........ I remember I liked this cd so much and the logo as well, I even hand- made a stencil and made my own Starz shirt, I think I used some of that gold "glue on glitter" in a tube and had one of the first Starz shirts, before the band even had any if I remember right.
Lots of good songs on this cd,  Pull the Plug being one of my favorites both on the LP/CD and live. All good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more.........
I could go on trying to describe the music.......... too bad there are no sound files for this cd....... so you may just have to order it and take a chance. The remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player Richie Ranno continues to be active in the music business, you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated	and see what Richie and the band are up to. Singer Michael Lee Smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into Hollywood....... but this is about Starz!!!...So.... I highly recommend checking out the CD's and starzcentral. Not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from Europe that is using the name recently
