No other compilation of Garland's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm.

All her ORIGINAL soundtrack performances are here, sounding magnificent. Far superior to thin-sounding studio re-creations, this is the real deal, assembled with obvious skill, intelligence and dedication to the talented legend.

In a sense, this should be the "soundtrack album" for that magnificent documentary about her that PBS produced a while back.

Don't pass this up
