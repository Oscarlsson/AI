Unless you frequented jazz clubs in Baltimore or Philly in the fall of 1955, this would have been your first exposure to the Miles Davis-John Coltrane collaboration (a few tracks recorded for Columbia, the label Miles would soon be joining exclusively, a few weeks before this session weren't issued until much later). Davis settled on Coltrane as his replacement for the departing Sonny Rollins almost by default - no one else fit the bill or new the book. That they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much (Davis was a hands-off leader, Coltrane wanted constant  input from Miles on his playing and music in general). 

STABLEMATES (a Benny Golson tune) is the track that seems to draw the most attention. It's an excellent composition, and although Coltrane sounds somewhat tentative (nervous?), the performance is attractive. But my favorite side is THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE, even though Coltrane sits this one out: Miles plays beautifully, and I love the emotion he wrings from the tune.

True, this is an early effort by the group that would transform modern jazz, but it's a very good session nonetheless. The group plays well, the rhythm section is rock solid, and they are all off and running. Full speed ahead
