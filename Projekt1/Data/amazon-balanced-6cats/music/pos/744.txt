This is the best album/band noones ever heard of.

This is the most underrated bands EVER ( Including FM Static. ) And they deserve some appreciation. This CD is a great rock CD and it has a bit of seemingly Hip-Hop bits here and there in just about every song. Almost every song on this CD rocks, so BUY IT
