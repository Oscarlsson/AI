EXCELLENT SONGWRITING, GUITAR PLAYING AND OVERDUBBING. ANOTHER LIVE ALBUM FOLLOWING HIS FIRST WITH PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SONGS NOT ON FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS SUCCESSFUL AS COMES ALIVE.  DAYS DAWNING, CRYING CLOWN, FANFARE ARE A FEW SUCH SONGS. A FEW SONGS FROM WIND OF CHANGE, SOMETHING'S HAPPENING, AND EVEN A COUPLE FROM HIS EARLY DAYS WITH THE HERD WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A SECOND SUCCESSFUL LIVE ALBUM RATHER THAN THE I'M IN YOU ALBUM WHICH WAS A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT
