1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of  Cleveland. Just like their other fellow Ohion's DEVO, the guys in PERE UBU obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.I have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and I have never grown tired of this album. I find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago,  if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it, it  just would'nt happen. There is just a certain magic that they  captured in 1978, as to the music itself I tend to break - up this  album into 2 distinct parts. Side One being the more accessible "drunken" side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise, but a little too intelligent, just listen to the lyrics.Side 2 is definately the "drug" side like a bad acid trip vocalist David Thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of Cleveland(I have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.I could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize, experience and consume at your own leisure, and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album  mean to you. So if you loved things like Throbbing Gristle's song Hamburger Lady then u will surely love Pere Ubu's album the Mordern Dance.As another reviewer mentioned before Black Francis of The Pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.I also hear there influences in recent  bands such as Portishead and Queens of the Stone Age just to name a few.So if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album, even if you have to beg,steal or borrow it.
