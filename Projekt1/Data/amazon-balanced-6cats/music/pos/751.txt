I agree with everyone else; the music on this album is completely magical. Two masters at work with a great rhythm section, very spontaneous-sounding contrapuntal harmonies, unbounded joy in every tune, and some interesting arrangements.

This is also the worst-sounding CD (or LP, for that matter) that I have ever heard. It sounds worse than lo-res MP3s played over the Web; I have recordings of 78s that sound better. I cannot believe that even Laserlight would release this. I have other Laserlight Cds and none of them sound this bad. If they remastered this and made it sound better, I would buy it again. That's the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5.

Still, it's worth getting if you can listen past the horrible sound quality
