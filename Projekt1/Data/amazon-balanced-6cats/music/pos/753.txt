Live Alive is good enough to buy in my standered's.....I really think this was recorded poorly but the songs on it are really good if you play it in your car, or on bigger speakers so you can really hear everything much better. Their are many good songs included on this complination of live performence's spanning from performences from Montreux Jazz Festival, Austin Opera House,and the Dallas Starfest. This recordings are all from 85-through 86. Jimmie Vaughan appears on Willie The Wimp, Love Struck Baby, Look At Little Sister, and Change It playing guitar, and string bass. I think the worst song on the entire complination is Voodoo Chile(slight return) which is kind of weird for me to say because I think that was truely the best song Stevie Ray played live but in this case its not. Other than that I really think for what it is it's a average live performence.
