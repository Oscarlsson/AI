Just wanted to answer Reviewer:"homedecaramel" and his question as to who Melissa refers to from the song titled' "Melissa's Garden".

Melissa was the daughter of close friends of Steve Vai.
She passed away 5 years ago at a fairly young age due to ovarian cancer.  Melissa's parents built a beautiful garden as a remembrance of her.  Melissa had a wonderful spirit and her spirit lives on as is apparent in Steve's beautiful tribute and in Melissa's Garden.
