From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures, Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno overload.
