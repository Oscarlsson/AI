This album was released in the summer of '86 when Queen's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the U.S. and at a very high point in Europe.By now,the band had adventured into pop genres beyond rock,yet colouring their songs with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing.Here we find the gorgeous ballad ONE YEAR OF LOVE and the catchy FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS.The ominous anthem WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER and the Highlander themed PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE are gems in this crown.The first two USA singles, the rocker ONE VISION (from Iron Eagle)and the danceable A KIND OF MAGIC barely cracked the US Top 40 in a decade when alternative music was preferred and classics were often overlooke
