stephen stills "for what it's worth" is, of course, a classic song. "burned," neil young's strongest effort for this album, is another classic song. the rest of it is all very good. i would say that it does sound a bit dated, however;, and that this one is mostly for fanatics of 60's music. your average "artic monkeys" fan is not going to find this a good match for their musical sensiblities. better was on the way from buffalo springfield. their next album, "buffalo springfield again" is an all out rock masterpiece that everybody should own, whatever your age or inclinations.
