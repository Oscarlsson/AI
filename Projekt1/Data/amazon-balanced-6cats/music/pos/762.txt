Another great album by Firehouse. My favorites are Reach for the sky, When I look into your eyes, and hold your fire. I have other favorites, but there are my top 3. I have a story to go along with this album, ladies and gentlemen. 

See, I was heading to Cross-Country one day, for the huge "Group 2" meet. (There's a section, and 5 groups from every section make it, and there were four sections, so you can make the calculations). I listened to this album, having a bad day before, and having a bad night of rest. Listening to this album, I got a river of positivity, and I had a great start and a great finish. I ended up smashing my last personal best in Cross-Country. Basically ladies and gentlemen, this cd has alot of effect. Get it.

I love to review things. Have a great day
