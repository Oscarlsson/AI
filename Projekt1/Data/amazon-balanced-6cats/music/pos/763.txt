The Dead were primarily a live road band, but on this and the other great album from 1970 (American Beauty)the band proved their mettle in the studio, moving into less spacey territory. The music reflects their range, from country and bluegrass to folk, blues and rock. Superb.

ps. their early studio effortsAnthem..., Aoxomoxoa) were also noteworthy experiments, but the music wasn't as powerful as the live interpretations
