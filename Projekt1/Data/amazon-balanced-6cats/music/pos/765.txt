but not the only one you should get.  Make this a purchase, but get live/dead also because it has all different songs, and then look at other live releases.  The dead have a lot of good recordings, just pick and choose among them.  This one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection.  It is amazing how many good songs they have, and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff, but you can't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it isn't up to scratch
