We are using this series of CDs in our homeschool music program - they are fantastic!   We especially love this one about Bach - what an awesome man!   The story of his life is told in a way that is very interesting and holds the children's attention while also using various pieces of his music in the narration.  It is done VERY well!   My children are gaining a tremendous amount of knowlege and appreciation for music through this CD and so are my husband and I
