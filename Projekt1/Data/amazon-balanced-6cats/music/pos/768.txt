I got the LP version of this album as a Christmas present in 1988. I immediately fell in love with it. She sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which were rampant during the Reagan years ("Talkin about a Revolution", "Fast Car"). But she offered hope that things would get better as we approached the 90s, which they did. "Mountains O Things" was about the materialsim of the 80s. Other issues she covers are racism ("Across the Lines") and domestic abuse ("Behind the Wall"). Even though this album is almost 20 years old it does not sound dated, as the messages are just as relavent today as they were in 1988.

I bought the CD version in 1992 and I never get tired of listening to it. All of the songs are good but my favorite ones are "Talking about a Revolution", "Fast Car", "Baby Can I Hold You", "Mountains of Things", "Why" and "For My Lover".
