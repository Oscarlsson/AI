This is the type of music to sit down, relax, put on a pair of headphones and let it absorb your concious. From spacey sounding electronics to soft vocals over piano to heart pounding rhythms to skittering percussion...this is just a taste of what is Supersilent, and from what I hear it is all improvised which blows my head clean off. All this coming from someone who has never heard them before...talk about a great buy! Highly, highly recommended, I close my eyes, to awaken among the cosmos traveling without a tangible body, drunk with the infinite beauty, I sigh without a mouth and think..
