Aretha's voice, her style, delivery and interpretation of her music is incomparable. These songs are more than just classics; they're a songbook to millions of people's lives who grew up listening to her in the 60's and 70's as I did. They evolk memories of times that changed our world, and showed just how powerful and influential music could be for generations to come. There is not much that came before, and very little that came after these golden years for Aretha, that can compare to this treasury of her music. Sadly the Aretha Frankiln of 2007 pales in comparison to the Aretha Franklin of this time, who was truly and rightfully The Queen of Soul.
