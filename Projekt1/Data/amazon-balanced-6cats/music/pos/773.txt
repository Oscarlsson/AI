This 1989 debut album from this Texas sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from Jason McMaster,catchy guitar riffs,and generally a collection of feel good tunes about getting drunk and having a good time.It fits quite nicely in my CD collection in the " D" column next to the Dirty Looks CD.I thought "Scared" was the best song on here along with the opener,"Teasin Pleasin" and "Queen of the Nile" but I liked all of them.The best way to describe Dangerous Toys is that it has a heavy Guns N Roses sound with a poppier edge to it.It's too bad they never made a good album after this one and Dangerous Toys would never get to this level again.If you want late 80's hard rock/metal without the spandex and the makeup,this debut album is highly recommended.Nothing fancy,just good old fashioned rock and roll
