This CD is well worth buying. But to you blues aficionado's who rely on Shaq's recommendations, let me put it in terms you'll understand. Coco is no SRV, or an Albert, or a Buddy. He's definitely a large step below them. But he is also not a lounge singer type like Smokin Joe Kubek, Lil Ed and the Blue Imperials, etc. Coco, is a large step above them. This CD seems to pick up steam with each song.  He shows his flexibility with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs. He performs a great ballad, with a Johnny Copeland, song (#6), that's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long. (I could have said 6 minutes, but Shaq don't fool around when it comes to da blues!) NEW, GOOD BLUES IS HARD TO FIND, and till "Jumping Joe" Bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues, this is one of the best of the last year, along with Walter Trout's "Full Circle"
