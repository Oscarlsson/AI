i do not own this CD, but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away. He had a good sense of humor and was very worldly. He would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club's heart rate had spead up 100 notches... and BOOM... he was back to being relaxed old lonnie. at the break i met him, and got an autograph. He was very insightful musical and with spoken words.I would reccomend seeing him live, aswell as buying his album
