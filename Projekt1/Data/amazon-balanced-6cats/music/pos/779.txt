I don't own this CD. I don't have to own it to review it, because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years. I lived this music. I listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities. Half of the bands on this CD I had the privilege of seeing perform live in the 70s. THIS is what FM radio sounded like back then. Every single song on this CD was well known to me and my friends. Yes, even Black Oak Arkansas (hot and nasty!), Nazareth (get Hair of the Dog CD for more), and the Runaways (hot babes!). Oh, and I love the movie too. Party on, dudes
