I had this album for many years when I was younger. I had looked for along
time to try and find it on CD with no luck.  I finally found it on Amazon. This is my favorite christmas album,  I even have my teenage daughter hooked on it now. The caroling medely is awesome and My daugher loves the Pinecones and Hollyberries song.  No one should be without this
CD in their Christmas Collection.
