this album was by far the bands most daring ablum. they went away from the classic INXS sound that made them superstars (Kick, X) and instead updated their sound to fit the time. like a previous reviewer noted, this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the US, and unfortunately, caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part. its sad too, cuz there are many solid tracks, inlcuding Heaven Sent (my favorite), Not Enough Time, Baby Dont Cry and Beautiful Girl. I have recently become a big fan of INXS and have purchased all of their albums. I like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums. I recommend "Welcome" to any INXS fan and any other fan of great music
