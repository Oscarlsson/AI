This is a great CD!  Each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end.  This makes it nice to just play the entire CD or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another.  So far the Car and Washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's favorites.  When she outgrows the need for this white noise CD, we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music.  For now though, this CD helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times.  As a bonus, the Waves and Rain on the Roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep
