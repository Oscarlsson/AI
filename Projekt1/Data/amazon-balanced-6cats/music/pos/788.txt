As a band, The Byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history.  Adding to that legacy, "Mr. Tamborine Man's" status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question.  This band could do it all; country, folk, rock, jam, psychedelica, etc, etc.  And this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements.  Though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ("Notorious Byrd Brothers"), this was where the band was the most solid, the most tight collectively.

Dylan's influence is everywhere from the get-go; 4 of his songs span the album, including the title track which the Byrd's turned into his only #1 hit.  Elsewhere, there are two other covers, but the songs with the best longevity are originals, mostly penned by Gene Clark.  Witness the tortured romance of "I'll Feel a Whole lot Better" and "Here Without You" and tell me he wasn't a great songwriter.  Roger McGuinn (or Jim, if you like) was quick about finding his signature nasally croon that would go on to influence Tom Petty, among others.  Obviously, not everyone had found their place; songs by Chris Hillman and David Crosby are nowhere to be found.  But "Mr. Tamborine Man" stand today every bit as tall as the early works of Dylan and the Beatles.  This is the album that set the standard for folk-rock from then on, from Buffalo Springfield to REM to Toad the Wet Sprocket to the most current emo bands.

Overall:  10 out of 10
