While Volume 1 of the DREAM BABES series is more accessible with its very girly girl group pop, sun-shiney vocals - Volume 2 offers a little bit of everything - from pop r&b, girl group vocals, pop, swinging pop & even some very early school grrl rock 'n roll - they might be a little more lyrically serious (hence the subtitle REFLECTIONS) but if anything, that's a good thing. It's nice to hear that women were trying different styles and genres and not just singing about about boys ...

And also know - these are not just timepieces to be admired from a distant - these are all still fun, interesting and downright cool to hear again or for the first time. 

If you're a collector, this whole series should be on your checklist
