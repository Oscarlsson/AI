What can be said about this album?
This is one of those albums that re-invigorates your faith/enthusiasm in music (those who listen to a lot of albums know what I mean).
Some tracks from here were most famously covered by Nirvana on their unplugged album, although pained I don't think Cobain quite got the feel that Kirkwood gives to these songs.
It has a perfect blend of songs that make you want to almost hoe-down and those that you can just reflect on and chill out.
Particular stand outs on this album are Split Myself In Two, Magic Toy Missing, Aurora Borealis and The Whistling Song.
This album does take some growing as Kirkwood's voice is abrasive, but this is an album that will truly make you love music.
Do try it, you won't be disappointed.
