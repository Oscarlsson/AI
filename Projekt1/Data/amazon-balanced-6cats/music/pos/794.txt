Pablo is definitely the Babe Ruth/Moses of these pieces. 
However, tempo, cadence, clarity, consistency and emotional projection are much better here. 
Starker is at least the Michael Jordan of the Bach Suites. -And compared to Pablo (I heard the Naxos one) the sound quality on this disc is The Right Hand Of God. 
Starker is the dog's balls; big ones, like a Great Dane.
