This is a wonderful Vangelis album and is fairly energetic, with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged.   Released in 1975, Heaven and Hell incorporates a full choir into the Vangelis sound. 

Vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers, electric piano, acoustic piano, a full drum kit, and percussion.  Vangelis is joined by the English Chamber Choir (conducted by Guy Protheroe) with Vana Veroutis as the lead female vocal, in addition to Jon Anderson (vocals/lyrics on Heaven and Hell (Part 1 So Long Ago, So Clear).  Vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano. As a huge Yes fan, I was delighted to hear Jon's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics.  As far as the inclusion of the choir goes, I did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording.

The Heaven and Hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including Part I (21'58") and Part II (21'16").  In general, the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by Vangelis.  Another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages.  Of course, my favorite part comes at the end of Part I, which is the 4'58" section with Jon on vocals.  This short "song" is quite moving and uplifting.  Movement II is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two.  The choir is featured on the second movement, along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented Vana Veroutis.  Part II closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section, which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section.

All in all, this is a good Vangelis album and is recommended along with Albedo 0.39 (1976); Spiral (1977); and the excellent Opera Sauvage (1979)
