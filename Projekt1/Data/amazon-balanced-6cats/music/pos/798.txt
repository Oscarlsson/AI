Nobody captures the spirit and essence of a city at night like New York City's own Ultrablue. The group is the brainchild of keyboardist/producer John Smatla and jazz guitarist Dave Stryker, who bring in an NYC all-star cast of players in addition to their impressive band ensemble to create a sophisticated and evocative musical mood. ULTRABLUE is the latest outing for Ultrablue, and the first release on 215 Records. The project drips of chill, smooth jazz, and rich, rhythmic textures that will keep the project in replay mode for a good while in your car and home players and on your iPod. Special guests include singer/saxophonist Pete Belasco, trumpet/flugelhorn player Randy Brecker, female vocal group, Allure, flutist Nestor Torres and Brazilian vocalist Gabriella Anders. From the sexy saunter, "Guilty Pleasures" and the spicy and sultry, "Indiscretions," to the scintillating "Soul Candy," ULTRABLUE provides such a cool groove and flow that it really does lend itself to be the perfect soundtrack to a night out or in (for that matter). Pete Belasco is featured on the sensual cover "The Summer Knows" while Nestor Torres livens things up on the groove, "Jungle Fever," and the delicious Gabriela Anders delivers an alluring vocal on "Destiny." The project's first single, "Shiver," is already attracting radio airplay from coast to coast... We expect big things from Ultrablue on this and all of their future releases. This is the new standard of Smooth Jazz. ~SANDY SHOR
