As we all know by now, Lil' Jon is not known for his lyrical capabilities, but for his platinum productions and ability to find guest artists perfect for his songs.  He is truly the king of crunk.  Many of the songs on the album are much like the hit single, "Get Low" feat. The Ying Yang Twins- strong pumping dacefloor beats, lots of swearing and yelling constantly Yeeah!, Whuut?, and Okaay!  Buying the edited version (if there is one) would be a total waste.  This album is not for the meek or faint hearted!  Much of the songs hardly have many words from Lil Jon himself, mostly from the featured artists.  These include Petey Pablo, 8Ball and MJG, Chyna Whyte, Pastor Troy, Jadakiss, Styles P., ect.
My faveorites
1) Throw it up w/ Pastor Troy- a 'hood representing song with a thumping beat
2) Get Low
3) Rep Yo City w/ Petey Pablo, Bun B- a very good song with talents all around
4) Knockin' Heads Off- again Jon struts his stuff
5) I Don't Give A...- perfect for before game pumping musi
