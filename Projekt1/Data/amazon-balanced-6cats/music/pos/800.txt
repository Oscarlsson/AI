I have listened to the cuts from this CD and was amazed at how quickly it  transported me back to the time.  There were several tracks that I was  delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an  entire album re-released.  If you are in a mood for a good dose of  nostalgia, this is the set for you!
