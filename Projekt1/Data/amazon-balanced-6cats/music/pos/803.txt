An outstanding compilation of a wide variety of popular and regional styles from across Mexico.  This set examines both traditional and contemporary music, including a brilliant ska-banda mix by the popular &quot;rock en espanol&quot; band, Cafe Tacuba.  Rancheras, corridos, boleros, indie rock and various stylistic fusions are represented, and even a few sones from Veracruz -- one of my favorite musical genres!  If you are curious about the rich musical heritage of this large but often slighted nation, then check this collection out... It might open more than a few new musical doors
