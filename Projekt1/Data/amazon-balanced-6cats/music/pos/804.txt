Now I know what you're thinking, why are there two releases of "XX"?  Well after they switched from Eclipse to Universal records they re-released the album "XX" but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals (BIG MISTAKE!)  The original album is by far much better than the Universal release in December of 2001.  If you're not sure which one to go with GO WITH THIS ONE!
