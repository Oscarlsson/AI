'Live Etc' is an absolute must-have compilation for all true Gong fans.It features a total of fifteen live tracks of tunes that originally appeared on the band's key albums 'Camembert Electrique','Flying Teapot','Angel's Egg' and 'You'.Taken from unreleased live soundboard tapes(I assume)from shows between 1973-75.Absolute best cut here is "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?" along with "6/8 Tune",that are the disc's only unreleased material.Other cosmic gems include "Dynamite/I Am Your Animal","Isle Of Everywhere","Oily Way" and "Master Builder".Duration is 78:33.Heard they wanted to add the 16th cut that was originally on the 2-lp record,but the CD simply wouldn't hold it.Talk about wanting to give your fans their money's worth.Long live the mother Gong ship!Recommended
