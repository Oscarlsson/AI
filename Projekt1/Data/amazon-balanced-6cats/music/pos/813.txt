I have been hankering after this great album on CD for a long time now. Imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available. Surprise turned to shock when I saw the price. Does the company that produces this CD not realise that are people all around the world (including South Africa where I live) who are very keen on this album? At this stage though, it is only the very wealthy that can afford it.
