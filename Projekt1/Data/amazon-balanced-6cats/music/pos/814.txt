This is the first cd I've bought in the Liquid Mind series, but after hearing this one, I'll buy more.  The music is calming and soothing; great to fall asleep by which I often do.  It lulls you into a peaceful state of relaxation, letting your mind drift away from the cares of the day.  It makes me think of floating on a cloud.  I would highly recommend this cd for anyone with a busy, stressed-out life.
