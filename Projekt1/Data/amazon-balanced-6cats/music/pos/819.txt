I was first touched by Pavarotti's voice as a teenager in the early 80's when I saw a PBS special of this concert on television.  The power of his voice and his personality are incomparable.  His rendition of Ave Maria is especially touching.  I would recommend this as a first buy for anyone who is new to the operatic experience, as I was so many years ago
