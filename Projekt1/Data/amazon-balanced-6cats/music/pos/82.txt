I had originally heard "Drive Away" on a radio station and I was instantly blown away.  Upon seeing the music video for it, I decided to buy the CD.  I was hardly disappointed.  The emotion that goes into the CD is amazing and it's definitly a CD to sit down and enjoy.  I saw the band in concert and met Jonah after the show and was amazed by how down to earth he was. Give Gratitude a chance and you won't be disappointed.
