They may have a new name, but their sound remains the same as before. Mixed with club-friendly beats and laid back drunken-style, the Liks have crafted the perfect party CD. Tracks like &quot;Run Wild&quot; (possibly the best track on the CD, certainly the most fun to listen to), &quot;Sickness&quot; (with Butch Cassidy providing some very tight vocals on he hook), and the Neptunes-produced &quot;Best U Can&quot; showcase The Liks' party appeal, while head-nodders like &quot;Bully Foot&quot; (with Busta Rhymes) and &quot;Another Round&quot; create a more relaxed vibe for the listener. The Liks also get outside help from artists like fellow Likwit-Crewmember Defari (&quot;My Dear&quot;) and Kurupt (the cleverly-titled &quot;Promote Violins&quot;). Of course, Xzibit holds it down on his two tracks, &quot;Bar Code&quot; and &quot;151&quot;. The only way this Cd differs from their last releases is the instruments, varying from violins (&quot;Promote Violins&quot;), trumpets (&quot;L-I-K-S&quot;), and even 40 ounce bottles (&quot;40 oz. Quartet&quot; skits). The thing you shouldn't expect to find is deep lyrics or dark productions (go grab Mobb Deep). However, copping &quot;X.O. Experience&quot; could be the best refreshment for this summer's heat. If you like &quot;X.O. Experience&quot;, check out: &quot;Xzibit - Restless&quot;, &quot;Alkaholiks - Likwidation&quot;, &quot;Kurupt - Space Boogie&quot;, &quot;Eastsidaz - Ducez &amp; Trayz&quot
