Bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz - he is also one of the most creative.  On this album, he gives us a new take on Django's music that is simply stunning.  "Move" has a smaller, more focused sound that it's predecessors, and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music.  

Bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around - this disc is all the evidence you'll need to draw the same conclusion.  Bravo!
