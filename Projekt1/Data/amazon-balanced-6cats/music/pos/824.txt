This album is just non-stop funky.  I originally got it just because I loved Living In America when I first heard it- but I was pleasantly surprised to find the rest of the cd just as good.  Check out Turn Me Loose  I'm Dr. Feelgood, Let's Get Personal, and Gravity- they're among the best  on the cd
