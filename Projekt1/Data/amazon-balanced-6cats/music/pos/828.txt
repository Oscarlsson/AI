a lot of people seem to snub their noses at Let's Talk About Love because it wasn't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it, but all in all, it's still a fantastic snapshot for Celine's career in 1997.

Celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly (Falling Into You was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time) but it was very worthy.

Among my faves on the album include "The Reason", "Immortality" with The Bee Gees (for a "Celine-less" version of the song, check out The Bee Gees' 2-disc hits collection from 2001), "Love Is On The Way", the very funky "Treat Her Like A Lady", "To Love You More" and the beautiful singalong title track.   This album also housed "My Heart Will Go On" which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million.   While it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes, I'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful, powerful ballad.

With "Falling Into You" and this album, Celine was the #1 female artist for a period, becoming a superstar right as Mariah was abandoning AC for r&b, as Alanis was going on hiatus for awhile, and when Shania was taking off but hadn't yet exploded into major-superstardom.  Love her or malign her (it seems fashionable to do the latter), she became one of the premier voices in Adult Contemporary and won over a large audience.  I haven't been a fan at all of her last few albums, but if she ever comes back with an album like these two, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat
