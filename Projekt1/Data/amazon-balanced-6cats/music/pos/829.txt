This album grabbed my attention from the first measure. Thick and heavy,  this is not like any blues album I've ever heard. Very atypical for Hidalgo  as well. This one is probably an acquired taste- one for the truly hard  core blues fan. The sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start, and the  more I listen to it, the more I like it. I can only hope there's a Houndog  2 in the works..
