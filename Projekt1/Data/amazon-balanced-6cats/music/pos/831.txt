although each track is beautiful in it's own way, it's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind. where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album, black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo.  the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey, and, personally, like a lay's potato chip, not able to listen to just one....yeah, i need the whole thing..
