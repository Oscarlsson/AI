Listen, did I hear someone say "lack of energy?"

Get this album, as my lovely wife did for me last Christmas, from Amazon, BTW, and listen to this lineup: Fire & Water, Mr. Big, I'm A Mover, Woman,  All Right Now, Oh I Wept, Stealer, Walk in My Shadow... Oh, get up off the floor, amigo... see, it's you that's having a lack of energy... I know, this music is like a workout, emotionally, aurally, and in the old pleasure zone too. Rodgers & the late great Paul Kossoff surely knew how to sell a song, didn't they? Perhaps these fellows were near the best, not only at the time, but in any century of Rock/blues/git-down-kick in-the-mud blooz music. Yowzah
