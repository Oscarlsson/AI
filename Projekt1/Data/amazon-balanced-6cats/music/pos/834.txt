I have been a fan for Jaci Velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages.  I do not speak Spanish but enjoy her artistic abilities none the less.  This album lived up to the Velasquez name in my book- My family and I only really enjoy the traditional sounding Christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the revised versions.  Jaci's album not only made sure the carols were sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs that will be added to my Christmas traditions!  Overall I LOVE this album and the only reason I did not give it a full five stars was that I am done with that Chipmunk Song.  Sorry everybody.
