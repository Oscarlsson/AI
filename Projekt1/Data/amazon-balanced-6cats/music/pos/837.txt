For those who have watched the movie Jaws (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score John Williams did for it. This cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly, with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film.

The linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information, which gives the overall package a nice touch. The overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent. A highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music
