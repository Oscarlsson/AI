Their 4th album as a complete group (not counting the few album Havoc & Prode'je put out) is my least favorite of the 4 SCC albums I have (I don't have the one from 1992 or 2005), but it still gets itself a 4 star rating.  Out of the 13 songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping; 4 are ok and the other 9 are good.  Like all their albums, guests are minimal and are on are on 2 of the 13 songs.  Production is mostly handled by Prode'je (as with all their albums) he does get a little help from Robert "Fonksta" Bacon & Tomie Mundie.  A good album to have for SCC fans but not their best work.
