It tiptoes through the years and delivers the punch, but as I wrote in my review, I never thought Shangri La was going to be the last, though it appears just that. But All in the Suit, man, they did that after Shangri la de and I wonder, if this was the direction to come, my god!!!!
It's worth it for that track alone..
5 stars is my own way of saying thank you, but it is not just sentimental, the only album in the short career that wasn't great was Tiny Music, but the quote "Trippin" made up for it.
It's a shame it's over. I don't like revolver, it's not evolution for Weiland and I can't imagine him being happy there, it steps back and all I ever hoped was that someday this band, STP, would reign supreme and been given the praise and adulation they deserve. ALl i can do is give stars, but I would rather buy another STP album or go see them live...is rock dead? I think it is and it went with this band
