This CD provides a fantastic overview of Rypdal, who has been recording for ECM for 30+ years now.  The tracks range from pieces with an &quot;electric Miles&quot; sound to an orchestrated track.  While very diverse, the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique,atmospheric tone and excellent compositions.  The infamous ECM sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering.  Informative liner notes as well.  Highly recommended
