What has happened to the song "Lives in the balance" on this set?  If you go to his website it sounds really great!!!  On this set it sounds awfull!!  It sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with.  The packaging if you could call it that is really lame.  Foam dots for holders?  What do you do when those fall off?  I suppose you put the cd's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up.  Not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work!  True you do get alot of songs for the money but, there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it.  If you own an I-pod I suggest you go to apples I-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less
