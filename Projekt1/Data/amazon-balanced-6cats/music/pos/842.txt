The Coltrane soundscapes that this CD is infused flies to the mountain and back again, that's the truth, but one troubling question for me remains; no matter how much I enjoy this fusion incarnation by masters (new & old) - Where in the world is Alan Holdsworth? 
If any fusion guitar player has the rightful title claim to the Coltrane moniker - it's Holdsworth. For years he's been building the bridge between the good old philosophies and the new world order.   
Including Holdsworth would have just been the jazziest thing to do.
