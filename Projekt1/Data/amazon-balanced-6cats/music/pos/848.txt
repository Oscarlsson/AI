As a pretty big comedy fan thanks to XM radio, i have listened to a lot of comics and I own a lot of comic CD's (Mitch Hedberg, Bill Hicks, Emo Philips, Lewis Black, Steven Wright, Pablo Francisco etc.) and my absolute favorite is Unprotected.  There is not a slow part on this CD and it never fails to bring everyone to tears on a long car ride.  His quick and merciless wit is better than any other comic in the US.  His family must be very understanding since he doesn't hesitate to include every detail of their personal lives in his act, but it all serves to create a punchline that we can all relate to.  The highlights of this CD are his daughter's boyfriend and guidelines for resuming sex after a heart attack.  I highly highly reccomend this
