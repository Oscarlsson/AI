If you want some Classical music to sleep to, don't buy this CD.  If you want some high energy symphonies, however, I highly recommend it.  From Bach to Vivaldi, the pure energy of this CD will give you a new understanding of the joys of Classical music.  Just don't listen to Track 25, because I have no idea why John Philip Sousa is included with Tchaichovsky
