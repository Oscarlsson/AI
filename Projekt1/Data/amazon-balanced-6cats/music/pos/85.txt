Well, here we are.  One of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90's, "Lifeforms" is true sonic adventure.  This is obviously some of the best work that FSOL ever did.  "Lifeforms" is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together, interchanged and meshed.  For ambient work, it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace.  There is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs, despite their being ambient.  It is very original, I praise originality in music.  Give it a try, put on some "Flower" "Bird Wings" or some "Elaborate Burn.
