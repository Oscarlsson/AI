This is one of the most beautiful, restorative collections of Celtic music I have ever heard.  Haunting, sublime harp, cello, guitar, flute, and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation, prayer, or simply unwinding the mind and emotions.  The poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself.  Highly recommended
