Juice Newton is one of the best counry-pop singers of all times. A great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs.
My personal favourites include the beautiful Angel Of The Morning, the rollicking Queen of Hearts and the strong and sorrowful  It's A Heartache 
After all these years, her work is unforgettable, catchy and full of energy and vibe
