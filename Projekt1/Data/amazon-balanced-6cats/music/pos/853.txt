This is a great album. Two of their biggest hits, "Another One Bites The Dust," and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love," are here. My favorites are "Need Your Loving Tonight, " and "Prime Jive." Most of the other songs are top notch, too. None of the later Queen albums matched this one. Definitely in the class of Night At The Opera, Day At The Races and News Of The World
