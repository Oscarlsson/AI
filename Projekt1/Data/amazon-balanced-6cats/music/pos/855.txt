David Foster, who wrote a few tunes on Yes's "Time and a Word" is here on bass with Tony Kaye on the B3 and it's the performance of their lives captured live at the Rainbow. A brave but good way to record a debut album, album was produced by Jon Anderson and the cover drawn by Roger Dean, just like Yes. It gives you feeling that Tony left Yes on good terms when Rick Wakeman stepped in
