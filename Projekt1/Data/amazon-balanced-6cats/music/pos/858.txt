Forget the nit-picky comments you may read here, if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album, buy it!  The recording is of very high quality, and I agree with another review, vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better.  The banter between the artists in between the  musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these  shows live.  One other observation, if you buy this not having a HUGE  appreciation for Sammy already, you will be blown away by his talent.  ..thanks to  Sinatra family for releasing this disc.  Hopefully many more are  forthcoming
