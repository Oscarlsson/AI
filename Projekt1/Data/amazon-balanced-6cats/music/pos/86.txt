I'm really not sure what the purpose of this Disc is, other than as an Adam Ant filler for those collectors who need to add more to their collection.  This is a slightly scaled down version of the truly best of "Antics in the Forbidden Zone" which detailed Adam Ant's career up until the bombastic "Apollo 9" album.  "Essential" adds the 1990 single "Room at the Top" from "Manners & Physique" album and "Wonderful" from the 1995 "Wonderful" album.  These two songs are not really worth the cost of admission and I think are probably the weakest songs on those two albums, anyway.  And of course "Essential" ignores the unreleased 1993 album "Persuasion" which had some really good songs on it.  If you want later period Adam Ant, "Manners" is really good and "Wonderful" is, well, less than wonderful, but still a worthwhile Adam Ant.  If you want an introduction to Adam Ant, the chronologically catalogued "Antics" is great and a more complete collection!
