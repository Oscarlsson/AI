I was very young to really appreciate the in-s and outs of this band and the members between SAMMY, Roth and EVH!  I honestly can consider myself a newbie to this time-tested rockers.  I just downloaded this off of iTunes and i can tell u folks, every track is amazing! its like when Lars (Metallica) said once: "i was always amazed with G&R"...if i may borrow this line, i had always heard of the great EVH vs. Hagar vs Roth but honestly never appreciated this Guitar work before today! EVH is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists. My brother in Law was debating with us about Slash, Sammy, EVH, and Edge (U2), Clapton  and apparently they all chose EVH.  I didn't believe it till i heard it!  EVH is an inspiration. Anyone interested even remotely in any of these guys in EVH's history, should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost all the worlds EVH has been to and in!
