Almost a classic in my book.  We bumped this on the southside of Chicago when this dropped. These two were like a west coast EPMD because they blended perfectly. U could tell them apart easily because Gangsta D had the eazy-e voice with the hard lyrics. While KK had a gruff voice and was a str8 clown. KK would say anything. 

Once again the whole crew is on this one also: Quik, Hi-C, and AMG. They had a tight click that just seemed to from Voltron how they worked together. My favorites on this album are: If u Want it, Be True 2 yourself, Let the Rhythm,and Just Ain't Me (KK solo). I still take hoodrats on "Triple MMM Shots".....Listen to the album to find the meaning. Hotep!!
