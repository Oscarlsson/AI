This record is a fine example of earnest juju music.  Other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards.  Chief Commander Obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife.  Keep in mind, this means amazing percussion work, intertwining guitar lines, loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals.  If you're interested, you should buy it.  It will make you happy, no matter how you were feeling, and what you're doing
