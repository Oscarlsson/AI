This EP is so good, that words cannot do it justice. They thought so too and exercised restraint (no lyrics) on this album. It is a departure from the previous album From the Vapor of Gasoline (which is also a very good album) in other ways, too, however; it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments. The production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and, thus, their interdependency, whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points (usually when things started to rock). FTVOG also had the problem of being a bit monotonous (of course: in the end, you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings). All the Suits Began to Fall OFf seems to be flawless, however - a well-rounded tour; very beautiful, bold and particular. Try if you like: John Fahey, Tortoise, June of 44, Sea Tiger, etc
