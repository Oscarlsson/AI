Some musicians, like fine chefs, make it look so easy.  David Grisman is one of them.  On the CD, &quot;I'm Beginning to See the Light,&quot; the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by Scottish guitar virtuoso  Martin Taylor and veteran Grisman Quintet members Jim Kerwin and George  Marsh (on bass and drums/percussion, respectively) for one hot little  album.  While the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards, such  as &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; &quot;Makin' Whoopee,&quot; &quot;Lover  Man,&quot; and &quot;Cheek to Cheek,&quot; the Taylor/Grisman Quartet seems  to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible  seasonings to the pot to make Emeril shout, &quot;Bam!&quot;  As Don  Stierberg, who penned the liner notes, says:  &quot;Music need not be  trendy to be great.&quot;  I wholeheartedly agree.
