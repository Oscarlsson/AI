I love jazzy hip-hop of the early '90s and if you do too,this is the album you must listen to! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous (and the most beautiful of the entire cd!) "Award Tour", "Steve Birko(stir it up)" and "Midnight".
enjoy this pearl of REAL hip-hop!!!
