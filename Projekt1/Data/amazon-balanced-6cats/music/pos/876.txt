Incredible follow up to Rated R which I didn't think could be equaled and they did.  Flat out incredible songwriting, amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best.  If you grew up in the 70's as I did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you. "Go With The Flow" is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you won't be skipping any songs on this disc. Baby Boomers rejoice, rock is back
