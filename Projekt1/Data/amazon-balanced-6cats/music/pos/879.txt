My one complaint is that after I listen to this CD, the catchy tunes get stuck in my head!  And then I want to keep listening to it more and more.  I love the selections on this CD, the fact that the songs are in English (I always wondered what the "Figaro, Figaro, Figaro" song was about!), and that a little background is given to each piece as well
