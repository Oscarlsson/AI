...wandering through the dorms in the 1970's this was one of those albums that was in everyone's collection. It was usually very near the front of the record stack. Every time I hear that opening guitar riff from Reelin' in the Years I glide back to a very nice place in time. If you hope to understand the evolution of US pop/rock music you need to become intimate with this recording!
