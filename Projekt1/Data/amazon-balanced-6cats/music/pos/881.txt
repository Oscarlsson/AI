I recently acquired this cd from my local indepedent record store.  This is a wonderful cd.  There is not much I can say.  I am a pianist myself, and it is enlightening to see how this brilliant composer/player plays the piano.  His style is completely unique.  Thelonius Monk is one of my favourite jazz artists.  I recommend this to anybody who has any interest in jazz
