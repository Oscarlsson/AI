I have been following gospel since the early 80s.  I am a big fan of contemporary gospel and Shei Atkins defines how R&P gospel should sound.  Trinitee 5:7 along with Dawkins & Dawkins have done a great job so far, but Shei Atkins covers it all--Relationships (cheating, divorce, pre-marital sex); worship; hymns; enocuragement; you name it and she has a song for it.  I just bought the CD and I can't take it out of my CD player!!  

Her voice is so annointed and unique! She can easily give Beyonce, Erykah Badu and Mary Blige a run for their money! 
She can easily be played on mainstream radio and everyone would be bobbin' their heads to it--yet she has no problem mentioning Jesus in any of her songs!

For those Christians who are looking for something that they can groove and relax too (with some anointing) PLEASE buy this CD--I promise you that you won't be disappointed!  I can literally listen to every song on this CD over and over again
