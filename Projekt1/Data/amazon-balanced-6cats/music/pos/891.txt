Both the Italian version (Io Canto) and the Spanish version (Yo Canto) are excellent, and amongst the best albums that I have heard this past year. The music is absolutely beautiful, fresh, and very well paced, and Laura's voice is soaring! The quality of this album is exceptional....the production of the songs lends to Laura's very passionate approach to them. Without understanding a word of either version, I cannot get enough of them! Listening to Laura on this latest release of hers over and over again, each song continues to grow on me and I find myself completely absorbed in this album! Do yourself a favor and get this one....especially if you live in the United States. It will give you an opportunity to experience the power of what music can be if done right. You'll find yourself relating to words you don't even understand!
