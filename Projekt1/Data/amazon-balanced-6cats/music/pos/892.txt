In this CD Laura Pausini performs songs from a variety of Italian singer-songwriters.  She ads her personal touch to all of them, of course.  The results are lovely and inspired.  A lot of the songs already had versions in castellano, but Laura and her team have written new Spanish lyrics to some of them.  All of these songs were made famous by their creators.  Most of the songs are ballads, but there are some midtempo tracks in the title track, "Dos" (Due, by Raf) and "Estrella gemela" (by Eros Ramazzotti), and danceable pop in "Mi banda toca rock."  I don't know about the comment from the reviewers below about "Mi banda toca rock" as Menudo song (a horrible thought to some of us!), but the original Italian version was fun.  It's not a bubblegum song, but about the combination of traditional Latin music (Latin in the original sense, all the musical varieties of romance-language speakers) and rock music, something that was starting to happen when the song was written.  This reminds me that someone was commenting that one of the songs had some sections in English.  I believe they are wrong about the song.  "Estrella gemela" has some sections in English, but that is the way it was originally written and performed by Eros Ramazzotti (in Italian and Spanish), to emphasize the influence of African-American gospel music in the song.  Laura also references this influence by using gospel chords at the start of the song.  All in all, this is a great album, so give it a shot.  Whether you speak the language or not, the Italian version of the album is even better.  Laura just keeps getting better with time!  Laura sei bravissima
