Nothing deep, by any means, but simply a light, airy listen, with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes. Even though the songs (most of them) weren't in the movie, they remind me of it, of the whole Hawaiian atmosphere. My favorite tracks, excluding the ones included on the previous CD, are Blue Hawai'i (by Elvis), My Little Grass Shack, Coconut (it's just bizarre, but addicting, making you smile with absurdity), Island in the Sun, Pineapple Princess, and Love Me Tender. Again, it's nothing dramatic or swirling, but it you adored Lilo &amp; Stitch (And how can you not?) and all it stood for, this CD might just bring some warmth into a cold day. Don't think about it. Listen and pretend you're there
