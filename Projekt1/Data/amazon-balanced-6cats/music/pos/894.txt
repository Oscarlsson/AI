I borrowed this CD from a public library, having liked the track "Crazy Life" on the Empire Records Soundtrack, and I was immediately blown away by how consistently good Coil is the whole way through. It is their most mature album, full of gentle emotion and idealism, and puts the listener in a good mood. Glen Phillip's voice is unique, confident, and beautiful. I fell in love immediately with "Rings" and "Dam Would Break". The haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate. "Little Buddha" is so different but so good as well. 

After I got Coil, I bought two of Toad's older albums: Fear and Dulcinea. Both are really good, but something keeps drawing me back to Coil. It is achingly beautiful, vibrant, thoughtful, and pleasurable. It is hearing Toad at their best.
