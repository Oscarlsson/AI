The original Jack johnson LP was my favourite Miles record. I also had an expensive Japanese CD but all this would not prepare me for what I discover here. Over these CDs one discovers the original sessions from which the record was made. This is simply wonderful. Ok sometimes it takes quite a bit of patience to sit trhough all this but it is worth the time
