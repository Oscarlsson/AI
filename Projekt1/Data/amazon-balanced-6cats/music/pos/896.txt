I love it so.  I bought it after seeing the video for "Make You Feel That Way" and I haven't been disappointed.  Love the vibe of the CD...it just flows and the mix is well done, as you go from a "head-nodder" to a smooth groove so seamlessly.  I just put it in and let it play!  My absolute favorite jam is "Nowhere Fast," which comments on what we were, what we are and what we hope to be "tomorrow."  I love this CD so much, I went and bought their other two full play CD's.  I make my girls sick with how much I play this CD.  I guess I'll eventually take it out the rotation, maybe "tomorrow!"  A must for anyone who loves great HIP HOP
