This album is the shyit, cougnut and c-fresh deliver, the only problem you might have with this album is figuring out which one is cougnut and which one is c-fresh, but as you listen you will tell differences. &quot;Back in the days&quot; is real old album, so audio can be bad for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this album. The beats don't get too bass heavy untill &quot;Hillary&quot; after that song the next 4 tracks or so are very bass heavy, but the flows are tops. These guys are the definition of gangsta, and is a must for anybody who likes gangsta rap. All guests are sick to, Dre Dog,Cellski,Chewy,R.b.l,2.2 and Mack and Al Kapone. Definetly a classic
