I got the pleasure of seeing Albert open for bb king. Unfortunately for BB king, because once Albert started playing his Flying V, with blues power, he demoralized anybody that came after him. He had the entire Universal amphitheater standing. and stayed standing for most of his show. blues power is one of his best. Get, listen, and then really listen. Because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes..
