The Bloodshot Gang knows how to have a good time!  If you're into the whole Alt.Country thing, you know that some of it is very sincere and serious (ie, Uncle Tupelo, Jayhawks).  Now I love "No  Depression," and "Blue Earth," but this is an altogether  different quadrant of alternative country known as Militant Honky Tonk, or  just Insurgent Country.  Truth be told, this incredible anniversary  compilation does have some poignant, serious numbers (Rico Bell's  "Money to Burn," the Texas Rubies' "Blue Diamond Mine,"  Mike Ireland's "I'd Like To"), but for the most part these  maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously.  You've got  Andre Williams and Sally Timms singing "I'll stick to you like  glue...", in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going  "G-L-E-U, GLUE!"  You've got a song with a man and a woman  serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss  each other's bodies.  You've got Kim Docter and Moonshine Willy belting out  "Turn the Lights Down Low," which really ought to be a hit it's  so catchy.  And you've got some great deadpan covers -- the Waco Brothers  do a country rave-up of the Who's Baba O'Riley," Red Star Belgrade  does it to AC/DC's "Highway to Hell," and best of all, the Unholy  Trio turns Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" into an understated  redneck anthem.  I'm only scratching the surface here, with 40 tracks over  2 discs.  This is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that  sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on...  

 And don't miss the fantastic earlier Bloodshot compilation, HELL-BENT (Insurgent Country, Volume II) -- see my 9/5/04 review
