Any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission.  These pieces, each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem, remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for &quot;New Age&quot;.  Sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully-crafted music weave its web...it's &quot;feel good&quot; music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor
