I consider this the first album in the second half of the career of Oasis. Following the departure of Bonehead and Guigsy, this album is basically all the Gallagher brothers. Having learnt lessons from Be Here Now, Oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from Be Here Now. While the songs are not as good on here, they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it wasn't as rushed. This signifies a big change of direction for the band, with little less ego's and a more sober approach to their music, it is only the songwriting that lets this album down. My least favourite of all Oasis albums, it features two really good songs, 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones. It is missing another two songs to make it complete, I think it should have included the B'sides 'lets all make believe' and 'carry us all'. It still includes a few Beatle-esque songs 'who feels love' and 'roll it over' and Noel once again takes over lead vocal duties, this time on two tracks, 'where did it all go wrong' and 'sunday morning call'.
This is a very important album, it grounded the band again after their ego's had taken off. This helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today
