Herb Alpert has done what few artists can do. He's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original.

I love the original "Whipped Cream", but this CD is a masterstroke. Combining Alpert's traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing, but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end.

Unlike some of the purists, I loved this CD and you will too
