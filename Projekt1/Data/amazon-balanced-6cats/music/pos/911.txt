I gotta be honest, when I first listened to this album I was dissapointed. But like any truly amazing album, it just took some decoding, listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing. Essentially, GaT are four people who are amazing at what they do, and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly. Their first album, emphasizer, blew me away, but I felt it lost steam around halfway through. This album does no such thing, and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album, which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for. This gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department. But dont get me wrong, this cd SOUNDS amazing. Anyway, I saw them live last night in NYC, and they blew my mind... I recommend this CD to ANYONE, and see them live if you get the RARE opportunity!
