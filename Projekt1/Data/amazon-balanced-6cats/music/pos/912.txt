Two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith. There are so many good tracks on this set that it's hard to pick out some over the others. A couple of superb standouts are Jolson's "Swanee" and "Rock-A-Bye," although every track is just excellent. The sound quality on the set is outstandingly great. I hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by Jolson and Crosby
