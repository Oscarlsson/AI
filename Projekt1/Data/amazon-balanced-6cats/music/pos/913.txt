This is the best "cover" album I have ever seen or heard in my life.  A wonderful selection of material and a reflection of Agnetha's great judgment of how best to pay tribute to her favorite, and most influential, musical artists. Her voice is absolutely flawless and just as powerful (and pure) as her days of old with ABBA.  It would have sold well with the right kind of promotion such as touring which I read she had planned at one point. Unfortunately, she had to cancel any such ideas.  I would travel anywhere in the world to see her live just once in my life, whether it be to listen to any of the catchy tunes from this album or anything previous.  We can only hope the day will come that she will do a live show again for us adoring and anxious fans.  It's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.  It is neither an impossibility that Agnetha record subsequent material in the not too distant future as this album without a doubt indicates she has so much great music left in her soul to share with the world
