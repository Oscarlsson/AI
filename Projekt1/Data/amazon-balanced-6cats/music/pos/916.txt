I don't see how they can compare these guys to The Mars Volta or Coheed and Cambria. I can hear the prog elements but it's more of a Rush kind of prog rock,shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics. They are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band: the songs just aren't as epic as a TMV or a C&amp;C song. I think reviewers liken Brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice. This is still an amazing album that is well worth your time. Go into it expecting Sparta rather than The Mars Volta and you won't be disappointed
