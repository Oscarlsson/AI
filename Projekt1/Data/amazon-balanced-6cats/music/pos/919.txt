whoa... this CD rocks, one of my favorite anti-flag albums for sure. This CD may not be what some of the harder punk fans want from anti-flag but i think it also shows they're growth as a band. They can play more than just really loud hard punk (though they play that awesome too!!). Some of the songs on this album incredibly powerful, and some are really catchy too. War Sucks Lets Party is a great anarchist anthem, and One Trillion Dollars is amazingly moving (i mean, seriously! 1 Trillion $ spent on weapons around the world in 2004!) Every track is good and has its own message! They seem to have no problem coming up w/ new songs... there are so many things to ridicule in our gov. I just wish that more people would listen to this band's message.

PEACE and LOV
