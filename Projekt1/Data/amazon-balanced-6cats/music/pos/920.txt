I bought this for my wife, a huge fan of Patrick O'Brian (she's read the books twice in the past two years alone). Ironically, it now sits in my car's CD shuffler where it undoubtedly gets the most airtime. 

I love this music! As another reviewer mentioned, with some cofee (Killick, there!), this music and Desolation Island in your hand, you feel transported to a life of long ago. When men sang to rouse the soul, brighten the spirit, damn the enemy and win the heart of their Colleen (sorry...Nancy) - all with spine, mind and muscle fully intact. The harmonies are rich, the voices deep. 

And yet, the last reviewer's questions have the faint ring of truth. My first hearing rang a bit flat, the music sounding just this side of stale. But, in the end, it just don't signify. Even on that first run, by the end of the CD I was clumsily, but merrily joining in with the crew. I suppose I have come to imbue the songs with a life of my own, belting them out at full volume down the highway. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do
