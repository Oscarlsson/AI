NIGHTRAGE - Descent into Chaos
-
Thomas Lindberg's latest offering to the music community is the Swedish and Greek mix called Nightrage.  This album actually being my first offering to the band I was unsure what to expect.  Like most I am a big fan of ATG and Lindberg's harsh vocal styles.... Nightrage however came as a pleasant surprise. (As in it wasn't, yet another, ATG Clone) They seem to have more Melody than Thrash but definitely embody aspects of both genres....  The Haunted, where the former ATG Guitar Players are now located, seemed have gone with more Thrash then Melody. (Which is odd since they actually have ATG's Guitar Players?)
Anyway, Enough Comparisons!  Nightrage is really decent for a newer band in an over saturated scene... Amazing guitar work and one of the genres best Vocalist makes this CD well worth a couple of listens.  Also I've only given this album 2 spins at the current time and stuff like this usually grows on repeated listens.
Favorite Songs:  Being Nothing, Phantasma, Omen, and Descent into Chaos.
