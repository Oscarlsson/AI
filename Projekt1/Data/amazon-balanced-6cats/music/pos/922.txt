Well, this isn't At the Gates.  Nightrage reminds me of many old Arch Enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic.  Of course, that leads into Gus G. substituting Chris on concerts being an excellent choice, as they make very similar melodies.  Some people say this album is heavy, which it is in some parts.  But its melodic death, there are no signs of thrash or anything.  Just great melodies, great headbanging music.  Add this to your collection, I think its better than Sweet Vengeance
