Chris Joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms, afros and platform shoes!  Joss' "You've Been Spiked" is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever!  In fact, this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70's...but it's all circa the 21st century.  It's good to know that there are still modern cats (especially on the ESL Record label)who know how to recapture music from days gone by.
