This is a really great follow up to Allison Moorer's debut album ALABAMA SONG. THE HARDEST PART, her sophomore CD, was released two years after her debut in September 2000. It builds on the sound presented on her first, and the songs are nothing short of great. My favorite track, though not her own, is her emotional reading of the Rolling Stones' &quot;Bring Me All Your Lovin&quot;. She makes this song into her own. &quot;No Next Time&quot; is another favorite, the lyrics are excellent, a great breakup song. The title track is a nice midtempo country number. &quot;Send Down An Angel&quot; is very sad but touching at the same time. Other highlights include &quot;It's Time That I Tried&quot;, &quot;Day You Said Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Is It Worth It&quot; and &quot;Feeling That Feeling Again&quot;. Overall, to me this is her best album. You can't go wrong with any of them but this is an artistic acheivement, and one of her best albums yet
