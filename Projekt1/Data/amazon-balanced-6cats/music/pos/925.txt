I have been a fan since Valotte. and I like the other reviewers here, can't believe why this cd didn't receive the airplay it deserves!There must have been some politics in there, with Sean's cd coming out on the same day ( Yoko?) It is one of those cds that you just leave on and you don't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you don't like! I love every song!! Especially "Day after Day"," I should have known", "I don't want to know" and my fav right now "Cold".. I hope that what I have heard is true that he is working on his latest now. Can't wait! Buy this cd.. you won't regret it
