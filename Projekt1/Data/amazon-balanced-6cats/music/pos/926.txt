Every singer ends up attempting Sinatra eventually, but few manage so well.... 
John Pizzarelli has been playing jazz guitar with his legendary father, Bucky, since he was 6 years old. 
John's latest album is Dear Mr. Sinatra, on which he plays songs written for Ol' Blue Eyes.... 
The crooner is noted for his sensitive phrasing and powerful interpretative voice, which recall the relaxed stylings of Nat "King" Cole and Chet Baker, as well as for his fluid, inventive guitar playing. 
On this album of covers of songs made famous by Frank Sinatra, John Pizzarelli wisely avoids the pitfalls of Ol' Blue Eyes imitations in favor of his own intimate approach, best heard on the set's more relaxed arrangements. 
My highlights are the tracks "I've Got You Under My Skin", "Nice and Easy" and "You Make Me Feel So Young". 
Both attention-grabbing and supportive, his expertly arranged big band accompaniment likewise evokes the ring-a-ding-ding of the Rat Pack era while steering clear of mere pastiche. 
With a total time just under 40 minutes, the program is a little short by CD standards, but the performances by John Pizzarelli and the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra in this warm tribute to Frank Sinatra are consistently of high caliber and hit the mark every time.
