This is a fabulous CD and exactly what I was looking for.  I'm also thrilled that it has an accompanying book with all the sheet music.  I am leading a seder this year for a church group who has never heard any of the  songs before, so I wanted the traditional melodies, easy to follow sheet  music, and easy guitar chords.  This is perfect!  I'm so pleased
