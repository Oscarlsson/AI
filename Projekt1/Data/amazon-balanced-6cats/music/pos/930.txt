I have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my CD changer.  I played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more, and it was one of the first CDs I bought.  A relative first introduced me to this album and of course &quot;Coming Up Close&quot; was the reason I bought my own copy. But I came to love each song and appreciate Aimee Mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter.   It is a great &quot;Road Trip&quot; album and &quot;On Sunday&quot; makes the perfect &quot;Summer Song&quot;.  The mix is not mainstream pop/rock.  It is not a 1980's anthem, but it is one of the defining moments, for me.  The lyrics have meaning, which sometimes defies what the '80's were about.  The only other thing I can say is Listen to this CD!  I am sure you will find Mann's unique voice as captivating as I do. It is a definite must have for one's CD library
