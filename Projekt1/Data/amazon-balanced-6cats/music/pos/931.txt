...and if you're fortunate enough to find it, I recommend buying the version with the bonus DVD, which chronicles the making of Yellow Brick Road.  When I bought it, it cost the same as the 2 SACD set without the DVD, so it was still a great deal.

My only complaint--and it's really minor--is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single SACD.  A second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package, plus any extra--maybe even audio-only interviews--still remaining in the vaults.  No matter.  The important thing, if you are able, is to make sure you have an SACD-compatible player (like the Pioneer DV-563A, or one of the really expensive players if you've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your CDs).  Even if you don't, the stereo CD layer still sounds truly excellent
