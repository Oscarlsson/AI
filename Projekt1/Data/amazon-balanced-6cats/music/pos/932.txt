Did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the FM station sound about the same?  Maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars?  The Libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough.

Their raw, loud style is closer to punk than any other genre, but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans.  Make no mistake, though, this is a loud album.  With the exception of the oddly balladish "Radio America," it's a pretty steady sonic assault, and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between "Louie Louie" and live Dylan on the intelligibility scale.  What can be understood is more erudite than you'd expect, though.  "What a Waster" is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction, "Boys in the Band" is the best groupie song I've heard in a long time, and "The Good Old Days" actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords.  Decipherable or not, most of the other songs are at least very catchy.  The whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now.
