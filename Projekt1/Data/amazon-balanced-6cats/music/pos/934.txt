This is by far the best psychopathic album ever released. Riddlebox is now in second place. Madrox schools ever other artist on psychopathic with this album. Beats are bangin' and lyrics are flawless! Great flows and he mixes funny with wicked. Best songs are This B*tch and Hey Phatty. Great album by the best rapper of our time. Madrox is so under rated. I wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in the process. Buy this album, best rap album ever made
