I own a lot of Waylon Jennings albums but I have to say, I find myself playing this one on 9 out of 10 times. If you want to buy just one Waylon album this is the one to own, the recording quality is brilliant for a live album and the music IS alive.  Simply great, I can't say enough good things about this CD
