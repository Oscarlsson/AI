The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.

Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.
