This album is ridiculous.  I almost want to say part of SRV's soul is in this guy...he is that good.  Honestly I think this album rips apart his previous two.  My hope is that Jimmy, DT and APO will bring out a 4th release...as good as this album or better!

THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT ALBUMS WHERE EVERY SONG IS GOOD. BUY IT.
YOU LIKE SRV, BUY IT.

Double Trouble must have brought part of SRV back, because this album is just plain sweet
