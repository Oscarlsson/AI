The first time you play this CD you're just gonna hate it. Promise Ring's third album is the opposite of this. Very Emergency is super catchy and tight but you get sick of it quick, there's just not much there. That understood, this album will rock you for years. It grows on you. At first listen it sounds like really bad emo demos. Like the faceless band you saw open for Fugazi the last time they hobbled into town. No hooks, no choruses, lots of really bad singing and sloppy guitar [with the drums mixed way too loud, an emo thing]. On the 100th listen, if you make it that far, it will sound like an old friend yammerin' on about the good old days. Trust me, it's a desert island disc in the making, I envy those of you just discovering this Cd
