Never mind the fact that Jay introduced the jazz world to Charlie Parker. His band rocked! After Basie,nobody swung like McShann. this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40's small band jump blues sides. Anything by this man is worth listening to. Another great disc by the Proper label, who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price. Highly recommended
