Like many of the highly talented and innovative groups of the 1980's, The Pet Shop Boys were ahead of their time.  This album was purchased mainly for "West End Girls" and "It's a Sin."  Play this album from beginning to end without interruption - it's fantastic.  "Loves Comes Quickly" emerges for me as the best of The Pet Shop Boys remarkable and unique sound - a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating energy.  The great contributions of Great Britain and Australia to music in the 1980's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920's to the early 1950's (no doubt the origins of some great movie scores) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll.  You will love The Pet Shop Boys
