If you enjoyed Explosions In The Sky's last album "The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place", and the songs by the group on the "friday night lights soundtrack", then surely, you shall find love for their newest record "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone". If you are new to Explosions In The Sky, I can only personally describe their music to you as lush, captivating, graceful, energetic, and highly inspirational art rock instrumentations. Please ignore reviewers who rate this album negatively because they don't like it as much as their last album(yet). "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone" is different than previous records; It is alot darker, but at the same time hopeful and promising, best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark night(again, personal description). What more can I say... this is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound. My favorite album of 2007 so far.
