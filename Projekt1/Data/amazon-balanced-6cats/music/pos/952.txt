I first heard Dan singing background vocals on the Jackson Browne album "Late for the Sky".  I was 16.  I went out and bought this album (which I STILL have!!) even though I had never heard it.  I had the pleasure of seeing Dan open for the Eagles at the Spectrum in support of this album in Phila, in 1974; I was a junior in high school.  They all joined in on "Best of My Love" and it just blew mw away. He had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano.  Few people had heard of him prior to this album. This is by far his BEST album.  It is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80's and a true songwriting gem.  I can remember singing "Morning Sky" in my friend's Ford on the way to school. You have to listen to it over and over.. "Someone's Been Tellin' You Stories" had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time. The musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting.  This was the most raw of Dan's albums, and by ar, the most superior.  Sadly, Dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer (check out his website).  Let's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon.  This is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970's rock and roll.
