One reviewer remarked that Morten Veland had &quot;done it again.&quot;  Yup, he shot himself in the foot again, just like he did on Tristania's &quot;Beyond the Veil.&quot;  Veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements, and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians.  His problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect, where it's appropriate, he just plasters it everywhere, and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible CD.  With all of the talent that is present in this band, it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more.  The songs where Veland does that (which are all too few), like &quot;On the Wane,&quot; are easily the CD's best moments.  To the band's credit, the songs are more varied than on BOTV, with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs (especially at the beginning of the opening track).  It's definitely still melodic goth-metal, but shows some new directions for Veland, which I find promising.  Now, if he would just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the CD...Sirenia's next CD will be a sure winner
