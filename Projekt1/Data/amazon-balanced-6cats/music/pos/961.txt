i just purchased this album, my first misfits album and every song on it rocks (i especially like where eagles dare).  i just bought two more albums, walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait.  my only complain is the sound quality.  it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more real too.  metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same.
