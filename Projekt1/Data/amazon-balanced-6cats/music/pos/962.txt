I usually don't do album reviews but I gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and I was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine I call &quot;The Sauce&quot; So many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings.  Word of mouth is bliss. A-G-2-A-KE who came out on Rap-A-Lot hasn't come out with a cd since this classic.  I'm salty they didn't &quot;make it&quot; because this was heavily slept on
