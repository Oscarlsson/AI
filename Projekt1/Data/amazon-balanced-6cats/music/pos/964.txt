For the past few years it has been very difficult to locate Candid jazz CDs, the label that critic Nat Hentoff created over forty years ago. This was a real shame because some classic recordings, including Booker Little's "Out Front" and Max Roach's "We Insist!: Freedom Now Suite," were on this label. I am happy to report that it was not because all of the albums were being deleted, but because they were (slowly) being remastered. Now some of the seminal early recordings of iconoclastic pianist Cecil Taylor are resurfacing, like "Jumpin' Punkins" and now "The World of Cecil Taylor." It is my opinion that Taylor's currently unavailable (at least domestically) "New York City R&B" and "World of C.T." are two of the great new jazz recordings of the early 60s. "World," recorded over two successive days in October 1960, is basically a trio date, with Buell Neidlinger on bass and Dennis Charles on drums, and Archie Shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks, "Air" and the standard "Lazy Afternoon." This disc is one of Shepp's first recorded performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with Taylor's music -- I recall the now out of print Mosaic set of this material collecting some 15 plus outtakes of "Air." But the master takes are truly masterful, and I am delighted that with this CD available once again, we can all return to "The World of Cecil Taylor.
