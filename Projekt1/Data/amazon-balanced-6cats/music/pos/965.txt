If you are looking for true HIP-HOP, this is a MUST for your collection. Four of the Best lyrist in the game is all on one CD. Quit buying those fake ass HIP-POP albums and get the real deal. From the production to mcing its all there.  Matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you'll have a fresh one in the stacks.
