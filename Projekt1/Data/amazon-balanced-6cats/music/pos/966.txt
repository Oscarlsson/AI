I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You, what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time. This album released all of the music in Aretha that was screaming to be released. It displayed a very mature Aretha with complex emotions, very everyday lyrics, ones that make you say, oh yeah girl, lol. but also a delivery that the average person couldn't lay down and dream about pulling off. This is just testiment that, even at such a young age, she was THE QUEEN
