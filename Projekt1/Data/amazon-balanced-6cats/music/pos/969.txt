This music is undefinable ultimately. Oh yes, one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive. One can say many things about it. For me, this, along with "Up the Downstairs" are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day. I've become a collector of PT's stuff and like most of it very much indeed. Check out some of the side projects of the members in the band--like Blackfield and No-Man. They are worth good listenings too. But, you know, this wouldn't be a bad album to start your PT experience with. No, not at all
