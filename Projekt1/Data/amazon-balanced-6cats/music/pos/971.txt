This cd is the funniest cd i own.  The first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny.  The second half is a little hard to understand, and it louds like is was recorded poorly, that is why i gave it four stars.  Track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy.  Eddie makes fun of Stevie Wonder and boxer Larry Holmes, and he does it well
