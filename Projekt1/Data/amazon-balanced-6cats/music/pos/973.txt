Another solid 70's band that faded into obscurity. The nice thing about living in Canada was that we got to see all of the minor as well as the major acts. Edward Bear fell between the two. The original members got together in the late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named Winnie. All of their hits are here as well as a cover of "Freedom for the Stallion" , a song that was also covered by "The Hues Corporation" and popularized by "Three Dog Night". Its mostly the type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from "The Last Song" to "Close Your Eyes" (I'm back again). A good middle of the road pop album to melt back the years
