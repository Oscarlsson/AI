I love "Fool For The City" I have also always loved Savoy Brown "Looking In" and didn't know until recently that Lonesome Dave was the singer and most of the Savoy Brown band went on to form Foghat. If you are a Foghat fan you should check out "Looking In" by Savoy Brown. If you've heard other stuff by Savoy Brown and didn't like it, don't be discouraged because "Looking In" (and only "Looking In") is essentially Foghat. There were a lot of changes in Savoy Brown personnel through the years and the guys that did Looking In were the best.
