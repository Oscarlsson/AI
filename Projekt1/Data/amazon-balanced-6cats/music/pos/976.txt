Joe Cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in R & B history.  He's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties.  This collection is another classic with great covers from the Beatles, Elton John and Gary Wright.  His interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs, but in DTS 5.1, you are surrounded (as if in concert) by his presence.   The completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance.  Imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album
