"The guitars aren't loud enough, and neither is the bass for that matter"

Which is so true, but it's still a great album. Seeing them live, makes up for this CD no doubt.

Stand out songs:
-The City Sleeps In Flames
-The World As We Know It 
-Just A Taste 
-My Darkest Hour 
-Empty Glasses 
-The Only Medicine

'My Darkest Hour' & 'Empty Glasses' are my favorites. I know those songs by heart
