Brian Regan is simply a comedic genius.  This cd is especially funny after having seen him live--you can just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions!  He has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly stuff we've all said/done/thought.  While I too enjoy comedians who are more "cutting edge", I don't think a routine has to be peppered with profanity to be funny.  This cd is well worth any price; check out his DVD and his live show, too
