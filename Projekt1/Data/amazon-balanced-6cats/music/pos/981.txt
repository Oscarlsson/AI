First of all i'm a die hard UFO fan,i own EVERY UFO album not just the michael shenker cd's...some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1) do the band a disservice 2)are smokin crack, and 3) are very inept in your musical judgement. While i'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god,and i hate to break the news to ya's but for overall sound/effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song. That bein said MAKING CONTACT is one of the top five UFO albums MADE!!!! the top five UFO albums any fan should get are (PHENOMENON,LIGHTS OUT,NO PLACE TO RUN,MAKING CONTACT,and WALK ON WATER) along with the two live cd's BBC,and strangers in the night. Misdemeaner has some cool 80's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream(and they deserve to be mainstream) so who can blame them,and some of these songs are pretty cool...IF,I might add if you have an open mind (so that excludes most of you shenker diehards)...........
