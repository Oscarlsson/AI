This is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time. Surprisingly, Evans' introspective style and Cannonball's soulful approach meld together perfectly. Perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are. Both The technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing. I've owned this CD for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings. Highlights are the amazing &quot;Waltz For Debby&quot; and Earl Zindars' waltz &quot;Elsa&quot;, easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written, in my opinion. You simply cannot go wrong with this CD
