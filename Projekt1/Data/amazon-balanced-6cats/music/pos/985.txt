I remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as Lloyd Dobler. This soundtrack is also one of those things. This album for me, as for many I'm sure, somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time, and even now actually. Of course the biggie here is "In Your Eyes" from Peter Gabriel. Who hasn't that track touched at some point? This also confirmed my love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic "Taste The Pain". Toss on a few from Fishbone, Living Colour, and The Replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80's alt-rock lover. Not to mention the goods from Depeche Mode and Nancy Wilson (Heart). In fact the only thing that could've made this album any better, is if it ended with a "ding"
