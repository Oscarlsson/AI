I'm not particularly familiar with Sonic Youth and the bits I've heard from their other albums haven't really grabbed me.  This does.  The rhythm section wouldn't be out of place in pseudo-tribal funk, the guitars are dissonant, jangling, sometimes hypnotically repetitive, and just plain weird, and the vocals are distant, airy, lazy.  Some of the best music I've heard in a good long while
