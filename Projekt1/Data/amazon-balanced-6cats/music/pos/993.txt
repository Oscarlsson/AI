This film came out in 1973 and I saw it in its original full length version (about 3hours and 15 min.) Executives from Columbia Pictures were there, it was the premeire, and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out(verbal) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums. The executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across Columbus Circle in Boston and I and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free. We returned to the film and I have always loved this crazy redition of Lost Horizon, the miscasting, the terrible sets, the odd ball music for the story, the dubbed Liv Ullmann, the dance routines of Olivia Hussey..all of it. You cannot find a musical like it, or a soundtrack like it. Columbia execs were unimaginative; they should have believed in this film. The next day after this premeire in Boston, New York etc. (simultaneous I suppose) the film was cut, the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..T Shirts, dolls, posters of all sizes, bath towels with the poster on them, records of the sd tk of course, and small pop up sets of the entire film. It was to be a massive hit..In two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed, and the posters said, Last Two Weeks, and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared.
But many people came to see it..lines of people, and, when they heard it had been cut, they gave up, and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film. 
I have many treasures from that opening nite, and now I have the CD of the sound track. Anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film; it is unique.

Enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a DVD ..they are out there
