Toad The Wet Sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties. They wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable. BUT, there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste. My fave song is 'Is It For Me'. It is hard to classify them though. It sort of deep and meaningful (at most times) pop rock. Other good tracks include Walk On The Ocean, Pray Your Gods and I Will Not Take...etc. I regard this album and 'Dulcinea' as their two best albums
