With Engines of Creation, Joe Satriani did what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to use. 

Only this time, he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar. It would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote "Satch Boogie," "War" and "Flying in a Blue Dream" went. 

Well, he's still here, only more than ever he's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey. 

I've never heard robots having sex, but I'm willing to be "Borg Sex" isn't far off. And although his calmly passing, sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure, that's kinda how you'd expect to see "Clouds Race Across the Sky." The 'chorus' to "Devil's Slide" sounds as sinister as its name suggests and "Attack" is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as I've ever heard. 

To top it off, the album includes "Until We Say Goodbye," one of Satch's best ballads in his entire catalogue.

If you're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work Satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off Surfing With The Alien-style, you'll find that there's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found. 

It's not a Satriani masterpiece, but its a true testament to the man's enduring creativity
