I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable
