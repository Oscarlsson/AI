Hold on ... let me start again.

Dang it! Give me a few minutes here ... 

Pinnacle Studio can assist ... 

(Samuel L Jackson-styled expletive) ... how many times is this gonna happen? Start and stop! Start and stop! Enough already!

One more time. Now, what was I saying? 

Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running.

Got the idea?

Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions. 

After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes.

If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere
