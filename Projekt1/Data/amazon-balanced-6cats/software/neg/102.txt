Let me sum up this software "total junk"

Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.

They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.

I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.

They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.

If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.

Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked
