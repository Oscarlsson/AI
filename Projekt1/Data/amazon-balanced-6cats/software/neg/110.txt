I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work
