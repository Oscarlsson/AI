I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.

In the end, I returned my copy to VCom, though to date I have not yet received a refund
