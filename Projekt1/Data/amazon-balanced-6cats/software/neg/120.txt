I received this item today and was surprised
1) It was shipped from overseas (UK)
2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought
3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc
4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support
5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected
