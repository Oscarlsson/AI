All I wanted was a way to identify some files, remember which ones so every time I wanted to backup, I would press "go" and the backup would start. AlohaBob was too "smart" for my use. First, it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up.  I indicate that I want to select my own files (which it lets me think I can do). Then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no, no, no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if I had selected the "smart find". I then manually select my files (great!!). In trying to save the "template" of what files I wanted to backup, it requires that I make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency (YUK!!). I want to back up when I get to it (about once a month, not when it wants to -- I am backing up to a DVD which I need to put in the drive).  OK, so now I am over that and the backup begins - GREAT!!!  Upon returning into the application a month later, I can not select my saved "template" to "run now", it will run when it is scheduled to run :(  So...I need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up.  I exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to "add" the features I described.  Oh well - it looked like such a promising product.  Now I need to find another that satisfies my requirements
