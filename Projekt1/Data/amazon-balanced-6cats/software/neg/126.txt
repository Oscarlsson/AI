I really dislike this software.  I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way.  First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are "C:" or "ALL".  I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult.  Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up.  Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later!  And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later.  Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over.
