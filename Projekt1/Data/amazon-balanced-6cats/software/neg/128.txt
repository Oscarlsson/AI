800,000 images without keywords - the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional .tif's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector.  The high res images aren't, the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and I've gotten far more use out of a 50,000 image collection b/c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection.

If you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image - then this collection is for you.  If you want to have any sort of search capabilites, look elsewhere
