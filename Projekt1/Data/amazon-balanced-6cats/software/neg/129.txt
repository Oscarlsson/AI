I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product.  There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call.  I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.  They offer only email support, but don't write back.  If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens
