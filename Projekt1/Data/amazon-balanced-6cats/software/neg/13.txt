I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. 
When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service
