I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.
Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)
So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund.
