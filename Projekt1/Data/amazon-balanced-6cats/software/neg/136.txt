By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without. 

Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.
Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.

I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.

Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.

Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.
