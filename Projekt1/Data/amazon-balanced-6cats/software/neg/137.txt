This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge.  All of the same info is on the net for free.

This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you.

This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.  He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product... but scams seem to be his thing.  AVOID!!  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.  

This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.  He is an embarrasement to his company and his family.  At least a mugger steals from me face to face... this snake is sneaky about it
