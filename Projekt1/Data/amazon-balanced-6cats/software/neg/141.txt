I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.    

   I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.
