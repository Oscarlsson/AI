Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.

Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.

As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.

While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility.
