I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly
