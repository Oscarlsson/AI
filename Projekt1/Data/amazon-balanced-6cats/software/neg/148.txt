I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived! 

I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost
