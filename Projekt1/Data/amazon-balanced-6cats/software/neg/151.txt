I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...).  Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the "this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down".  I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far.  I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed.  I am running windows 98SE.  I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible).  It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer.
