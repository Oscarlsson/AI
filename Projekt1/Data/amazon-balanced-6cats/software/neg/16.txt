The only redeeming quality about this GPS system is that it's cheap.  I used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after I got it.  The navigation is poor. I found that I often had to look over to the laptop screen because I was "off route" so often due to the poor maps. The system repeated the same annoying problems that I see in other feedback.

1) The unit would show me being off the road even though I was on an Interstate. In this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around. 

2) It directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction.  

3) It could not locate a POI that turned out to be a few hundred yards away  

4) It often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination  

5) It doesn't provide a chime when it's time for a turn.  It will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead, but that might be the last time you hear an instruction.

6) In one case, it got me to my destination (at least close enough) but couldn't guide me back to my starting point.

The GPS receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well. But the maps are poor, as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980's computer generated voice.

If you're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this ISN'T it.

This is going back asap.
