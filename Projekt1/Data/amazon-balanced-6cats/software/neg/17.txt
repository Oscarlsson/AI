I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.  

The summary of this product is that it is "highly unusable".  You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again.  Yes, you can "manage" you way with this product.  However it is not worth your time and money.

And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on!
