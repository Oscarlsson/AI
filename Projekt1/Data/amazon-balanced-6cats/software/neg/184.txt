...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.

Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that
