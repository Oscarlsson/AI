I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software. 
I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.
