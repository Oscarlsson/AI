I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program
