I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!
I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.
DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS
