I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.    

A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio?
