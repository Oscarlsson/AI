My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.

What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.

The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program. 

Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!

I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars
