I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed
