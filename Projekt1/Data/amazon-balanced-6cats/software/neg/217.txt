I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.

50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. 

Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.
