i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security.  Now i regret buying one.  Since ive installed it, IT SLOWED MY COMPUTER, ITS VERY VERY HARD TO CLOSE WINDOW AND WORSE WHEN I DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET I HAVE A HARD TIME LOGGING OFF.  everytime im on the internet,i get mad and upset. its not worth all the stress. i definitely dont recommend this product. now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to NOrton
