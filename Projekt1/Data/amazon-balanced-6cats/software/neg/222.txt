I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:

1.  When the program works, it's superb.

2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.

For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.

Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.

My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle
