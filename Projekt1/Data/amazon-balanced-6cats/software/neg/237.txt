I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.
