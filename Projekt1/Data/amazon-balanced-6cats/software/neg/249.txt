The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out
