This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money
