I just installed AutoRoute 2007. There is a feature in AutoRoute where you can display various places of interest on the map. In this version, for some installations you can not hide restaurants. This has been reported on the Microsoft UK AutoRoute community website. I loaded the program on a second computer with the same result. Both systems run Window XP Pro. This means for certain cities, like Paris, at certain magnifications, the map is completely cluttered with small green squares which indicate the location of a restaurant. MicroSoft only indicates that they will enter this bug into the work request for the next version of AutoRoute. They also say earlier versions were not affected. You may want to buy 2007 but check out your ability to show/hide all of the items of interest right away and be prepared to be dissappointed. I am going to try finding AutoRoute 2006 for sale
