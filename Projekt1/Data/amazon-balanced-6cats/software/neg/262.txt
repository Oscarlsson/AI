My desktop CD-ROM refused to recognize that the CD was in the tray. It did recognize other CDs. My desktop is a HP Pavilion 2000 with Windows XP HomeVersion. My laptop did accept the CD so I know that it is not the CD. I purchased the product for use on my desktop, not the laptop.
I would appreciate instructions on fixing the problem
