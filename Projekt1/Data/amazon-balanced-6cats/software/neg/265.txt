I bought the software ( Digital Image Suite 2006 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.  
A BIG MISTAKE.

I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2).
UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same.  So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which camera made the image.

Here is complaint number two -
If you use Microsoft's Customer Service/Technical Support you will be routed to India - and they will just give you an answer that is vaguely related to your problem.

After emailing several times and getting nowhere you will find out that you can't write to their Washington state headquarters unless you have the name of someone in the address.

So, basically, Microsoft is the largest technical software company in the world with the worst customer service and no American technical support.

Now, for the final complaint.  There is no link or method to get updates or upgrades for this program!  So, if I want to use a Microsoft software package to edit my photo images then I will have to buy a new software package - isn't that wonderful.
