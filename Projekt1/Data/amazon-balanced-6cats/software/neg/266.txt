When printing cards it leaves a large border around front of card graphics.  The cards do not print anything like they are shown on box display with front of card display taking up the whole card. When I contacted tech support I was advised that in order to correct this problem my printer must have a borderless printing option.  My printer does not & I have been using another major greeting card software for about a year and half and never had this problem with that program. There is nothing on the outside of box under the system requirements that states this.
On the outside of the box it says you can return for refund if not satified within 30 days and that the details are in the box.  There are not any details in the box and when I contacted the company I got run around in circles stating there were two companies involved with the software and was never given information on how it could be returned.  I am stuck with it
