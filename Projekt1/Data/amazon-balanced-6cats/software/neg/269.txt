On the front of the box it says it can be used for Professional photo editing and has 20,000 Professionally Designed Projects, when I received the box it had a disclaimer that the photos cannot be used for products for re-sale, I purchased this product to do a work at home video and spent all morning evaluating the different software's and now I find out it is totally worthless to me. I went to there website and it says allow 4-6 weeks for a refund! I am going to turn them into the FTC for false advertisement
