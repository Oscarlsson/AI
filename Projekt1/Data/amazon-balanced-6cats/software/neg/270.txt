I wanted to use this product to tape sporting events, as part of a promotions unit I belong to. I had used Videowave 7 which was OK and produced a more than adequate product, but would on occassion crash to the extent I would have to reload the software. I thought I would give PE 3.0 ago, since Adobe products generally have a good reputation. 

Well, it goes to show that you can't just rely on reputation. The program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera. THe camera records DVD video (VOB files) straight to DVD. When I capture these files into the PE program, all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless. I have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result. There is nothing to be done from that point...for me this program falls on the first hurdle!! It is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly, and frustrating that I actually paid money for it...a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort. 

I have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video, and to be honest he layout of the settings, ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than Videowave 7 IMHO. I was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro, text and audio overlays very quickly. Still this isn't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered.

If you are videoing things that don't move you may well like this product. If you are videoing dynamic scenes, give it a miss. Big disappointment
