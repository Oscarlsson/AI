If you own a newer DVD camcorder that is manufactured by Panasonic, Hitachi, and others that records your movies in a .vro format you can not use this product.  You will have to buy an additional program that will cost about $40 to convert the .vro format to a avi, wav, or mpeg format.  If you own a camcorder that records in .vro do some research before you waste $80 on this program
