Yes, I love Microsoft Office. It's incredibly user friendly, it has wonderful features, most of which I don't even know how to use, and it's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it's kind. I've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy Microsoft for my personal use, the school would always buy one for me. And of course there are always illegitimate means... but I'm not advocating piracy here.

However, I would be the last person on earth to consider using Microsoft Office if I had to pay $350 for it. It's an insane price. consider the alternatives:

Open Office: Does everything MS Office does, some things even better. I love how you don't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in Open Office. The best thing about this, however, is that it's FREE!

Google Docs and Spreadsheets: This one is even better. Not only is it free like everything else from Google, you can COLLABORATE IN REAL TIME with  anybody else on the internet to write your word documents! Nothing beats that, it's just the most wonderful thing that Google has done
