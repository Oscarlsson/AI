This year, instead of renewing my subscription to Norton system Works 2004, I thought would be a good idea to bring it up to date. I purchased Norton system Works 2007. The 2004 version worked fine for several years, while the 07 version could not be installed on my XP professional PC. The Norton "consumer firewall" worked perfectly. They make it very hard to get effective help (unless you want to pay them $9.95 per call). Several sessions on their complementary "live chat" system proved useless. In the end, efforts to resolve the problems simply wasted an otherwise perfectly good weekend. I returned the product to Norton for a refund. Their return procedures indicate that I will wait six weeks to get my money back. Just wonderful
