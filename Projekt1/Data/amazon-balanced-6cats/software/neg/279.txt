NSW 2007 (or 2006) premiere is useless when it comes to VISTA...and considering it comes pre-packaged with EVERY PC known to man (desktop or laptop) this is unforgiveable.
Norton AV has an update but that is a far cry from the ~$100 price of SystemWorks that MUST be uninstalled according to MS VISTA.
MAYBE with the 2008 version
Truth be known, System works has saved my aZZ a number of time since the 2003 version but now it is useless
