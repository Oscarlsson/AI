Systemworks continues to grow, taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer, and I'm likely to buy an alternative next time I update.  Note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer - a new hard drive, motherboard, or processor and Symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy.  I like the basic functions, but there's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore
