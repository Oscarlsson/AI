This is a terrible suite.

Read the fine print very carefully:  It will not work on RAID configurations of any kind.  It will tell you that in the install (thanks a lot...kinda late?)

I found its support on recovery disc of USB hardware unstable.

This is a very unstable, even errant, set of programs.  It also tries to take over a lot of system elements
