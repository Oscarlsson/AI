I've a Norton user for many years.  I 'upgraded?' from NAV 2005.  This product was a pain to install.  I had to uninstall Zone Alarm, which isn't noted anywhere.  I've never had to do that before.  The installation process required rebooting multiple times.  In the past it had been an easy process.  Not anymore!  I will not buy Norton in the future
