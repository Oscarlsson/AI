While installing Norton Antivirus 2007 XP, a Norton message flashed that I must delete Webroot for MSN. I did it, and it resulted in crashing the session. 
Tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait. Then ried the online chat. The wait went on for 9hrs, started #245 in the queue and by now in lline at #59 I realized this was not the Norton I'd used for so many years, I ordered Kapersky anti-virus.
