This is a good product, except it keeps shutting down when I have my outlook or when I have a web page open.   My main goal for an antivirus would be to run when I search the web or get in new emails!   What good is it if it shuts down when these are open!   It did find a trojan on my first scan.  This was one that Norton missed.  I will be getting NOD32 soon.  Sorry this product did not work for me! It was very easy to use
