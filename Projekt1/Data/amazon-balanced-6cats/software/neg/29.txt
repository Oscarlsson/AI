I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.
