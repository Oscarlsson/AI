This software does not provide even the basic red eye fix.  It turns them a light shade of grey, maybe. It is horrible.  This to me renders it useless. 

It is for the most basic of users.  There are no real manual functions to speak of, and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it.  

It has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly,I would say do not buy.  Seller was great, product is poor.
