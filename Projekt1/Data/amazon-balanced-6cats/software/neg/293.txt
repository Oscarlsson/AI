Caution: Giving this software to your enemies will gaurantee that they will become mortal enemies, if they are not so already. 1 star is overrating this "product". I am only writing this review to satify some sort of altruistic urge. This software isn't worth a second more of your time. Just click a link now. Good bye! You are still there? OK, read on. I write computer code (C++, Java, C#) for a living and I could not get this software to work correctly. Starting up the "main console" application (read: service) kept turning off the Firewall (service). I could turn on the Firewall - but only if the main service was off. Brilliant! Well done guys on this festering sore of a pile of software. Glad I got my $50 back with the rebates, they should have paid me at least $100 for the wasted time. I spent an hour with their help, chat (which was slow and ineffective) and another 30 minutes tweaking the registry, all to no avail, but lots of frustration. I'm looking for another Firewall/Virus solution now
