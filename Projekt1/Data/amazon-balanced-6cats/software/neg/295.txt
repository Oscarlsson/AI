After using this product for Mac for over 10 years.  I'm done.  The price keeps going up, the "tax-help" within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non-existent.  

The server meltdown this year was the last straw.  Their servers weren't too busy to let me pay to efile.  But, apparently they were "surprised" by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service.  Baloney.  I'll use a pencil and paper next year before I give Intuit another $100.
