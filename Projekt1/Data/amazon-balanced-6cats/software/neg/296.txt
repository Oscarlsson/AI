This software now constantly tries to get you to upgrade to a "better" package - the schedule C for small business.  I used to like TurboTax, but it has really gotten to be a pain. 

And finally, I spent two days trying to e-file, always getting a Server busy message from Intuit.  This is AFTER they got my credit card number and $34. to file the fed and state tax returns.  So I had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the Post Office.  Intuit lobbied the Gov to let them keep this big $$$ plum, and then screwed it up.  They had this same problem last year, and it is WORSE this year. Time to call all our representatives and get E-File FREE from the IRS.  It saves the IRS money, far more than it costs.  Why is Intuit allowed to suck this much more from us after making big profits on the package
