I use turbotax every year and I would E-file also. It says I can E-file for $16.95 and it even says that's all it will cost on one of the last windows.  Then right before it is about to transmit it says $16.95 for federal plus $16.95 for state plus 2.5 percent what I owe to some "third party" company, thats $25 for each 1,000 you owe.  If I'm paying some third company to transmit my return than why am I paying turbotax to do it also?

So ok I'll print it out and send it in. It wants to print out every worksheet and statement for a total of 53 pages.  It no longer gives you the option to just print the pages you need.

I am now cornered into paying the extra $90 to efile or go through the torture of printing out 53 pages in which I need only 5 or 6.

Dirty trick.

It makes the total cost $130.  It would of been cheaper and more efficent going to a good accountant.

Other than that the program has worked even easier than ever before
