After years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price, it would have been more forthcoming for TurboTax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return.

I lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees: $44.95 (plus tax) for the program, $16.95 (plus tax) for each return e-filed (I filed two) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [credit card] transaction (that fee is never quoted in the program and I will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is).  In addition, anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his/her refund has to pay an additional $30.

The product does what it says.  But, for the cost, and less-than-honest way in which the change occured (it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating), I would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant.

People expect change, even if they don't like it.  But, suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away.  Surely the marketing/advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a "positive" spin on it.  "Filing fees only $16.95 [per return] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . ."

No more TurboTax for me
