Turbo Tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions. It seems to view short sales as errors, reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold. It does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale. It does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months, but covered by disqualifying call options. Its screens for schedule D and D1 are awkward - it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions, with tags to set short term and long term tax application, from which D and D1 could be formatted for filing.
