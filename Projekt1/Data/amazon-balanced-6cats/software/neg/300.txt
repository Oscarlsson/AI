I have used Turbo Tax for the past 3 years so this year like a drone I purchased it at Amazon. Great price by the way. Well I receive the product and try to load it and find out as of July '06 it isn't compatible with windows '98. Now I have to send it to Turbo Tax for a refund. Its great that they are doing that but they should have put something on the front of the box. After a 45 minute call to Turbo Tax they finally agreed to credit me the difference of $20 for the purchase of their online software. The online software was the same exact program I purchased from Amazon but they charge $20 more...go figure. It sounds fishy and deceitful to me. I will never buy their software again!
