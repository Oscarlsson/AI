The product performs inconsistently. It failed miserably when it tried OCR on a page printed in comic sans, for instance, mistaking a's for g's, and @'s for a's, etc.  In short it was worthless for scanning in something as simple as a list of names and email addresses.   

It's "OK" when doing some fonts. And generally manages to figure out where the images are.  The interface is supposed to be simple, but is counter-intuitive, and confusing to learn.

Scanners are "iffy" -- may work, may not, so make sure you test in the 30 day trial period.  

Support?  Forget unless you want to pay.  Not even a single support call is included in the package. 

I will NOT buy or upgrade with this company again unless they are willing to provide at least a minimum of a couple of support calls or emails. 

I've had almost all the versions before this, and to be honest like this one less than what was before. 

If you want to try it, buy from a source that will honor the 30-day money-back trial period. You may need it
