I bought OmniPage 15 yesterday morning as a download, and have been trying to activate it ever since. After several calls to customer service, forty minutes on hold to speak with a tech rep (who emailed me two links that don't open), I'm no closer to being able to use this program. It seemed to work okay in the few intro uses allowed before you had to activate to continue, but even then it kept wanting to reload with every page I scanned in. 

The product might be a good one--I'm not a fair judge of that--if only you can get it to work. As others have pointed out, tech support is expensive. If my experience is any measure, it's also worthless. 

Customer service is unresponsive, unpleasant, and unprofessional. In one call to Customer Service, I was asked if I typed the letters in the serial number as capitals and the O's as zeroes. When assured that I had, several times, she replied, "Then I can't help you--call the tech department," and abruptly hung up. To add irritation to insult, in the forty minutes I was on hold with the tech department, I listened to repeated assurances that a "reepersentative" would be with me shortly.  

Not recommended.
