Omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes (often occuring at the end of a lengthy process).  Nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want $9.95 for an email question or $19.95 for a phone question.  You might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of Omnipage you would expect some support.  I recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support
