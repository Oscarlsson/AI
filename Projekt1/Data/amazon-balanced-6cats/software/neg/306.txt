The real headache began when I attempted to "activate" the program.  I spent hours trying to activate it, to no avail.  I got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems.  Now, I would just like to get my money back.  I have used ScanSoft's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it, but, for whatever reason, OmniPage 15 has become, for me, an expensive nightmare.  After having spent many hours trying to activate it, I still have not succeeded.  Their support leaves a lot to be desired.  For one thing, they keep "bankers hours" so don't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours
