  I had to work with a pc and windows because of my profession......architect..  My firms have always used architectural desktop.  Unfortunately, it only is compatible with a pc.  NOW  !!  finally I purchased an exquisite iMac.. and when need be, I can run architectural desktop on it in windows to get a few things done..    Apple vs PC ?
No comparison.... and my iMac is so sexy it makes me smile.. so kill me.
