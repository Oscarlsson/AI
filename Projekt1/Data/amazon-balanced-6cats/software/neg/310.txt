Other than the substandard security; the endless hours you will spend trying to clean out spyware, protecting against viruses, etc.; and the fact that Microsoft has built in it's own spyware to notify them when you are connected to the internet, it's pretty good. It is a good evolution of their graphical interface and quite intuitive. 

If you are concerned about your ability or willingness to protect yourself against malicious attack from internet scumbags, buy a Mac. As you face the upgrade to MS Vista, you're going to need to upgrade your CPU, so you are essentially at a crossroads.

Good luck
