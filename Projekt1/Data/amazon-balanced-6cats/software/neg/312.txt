My last Roxio product was "Easy CD Creator 5." When I switched to a Mac I naturally expected "Toast" to be the Mac version of this product. I am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my (many years old) version of CD Creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of "Toast" which I unfortunately own. It allowed me to edit video clips, create several levels of customizable menus, customize the size of compression, and burn to a DVD which played on my standard DVD player. Toast can create one uncustomizable  menu level, has NO editing, and locks up every time you drag a file into it. They (in the product description) say it reads mpegs but it's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg. It doesn't even read every mpeg reliably. The only thing I can find that Roxio adds to Toast that isn't in my old version of CD Creator is more enhanced MP3 and music features (which isn't what I bought it for). I may have been better off using "Parallels" in combination with CD Creator. I am sorry but compared to Roxio's CD Creator (which is basically the same price), Toast seems to have been designed by total IDIOTS. And I always thought that Mac software was better for working with multimedia
