We purchased this to make sure we didn't miss anything re: stock options.  The program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type, though they were not entered twice.  It took me quite sometime to get them deleted.  It also said we had to pay estimated tax next year-which isn't true since we overpaid (as we have always done).  Too many errors for a tax program
