I bought the Mac version of TurboTax Premier, and I installed it on my Mac with OS 10.3.9. After doing my entire return, I clicked to e-file and received a message saying, "Could not load attribute," This error box gave me the options to continue (which just took me back to the e-file page, which led me to the same error message) or connect to Intuit online support. The Intuit support site said, "This error occurs when attempting to file electronically.  If you are connecting through a router, try bypassing the router and filing again.  If the error persists, it may be necessary to file by paper.  We are currently working to resolve this error. . . . To be notified as soon as we have an answer, click here to sign up."

I don't have the technical know-how to "bypass the router." I also figured that if Intuit hadn't solved the problem by March 26 (the day I was ready to submit my return), they probably weren't going to, even if I were willing to hold onto my return until I'd received word they'd solved the problem. So I ended up mailing in my return. If I'd known up front that I wouldn't be able to e-file, I probably wouldn't bought the program.
