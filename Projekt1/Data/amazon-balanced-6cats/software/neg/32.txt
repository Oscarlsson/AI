Attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move... none of my access 97 programs work now... in fact I, I brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions... nope... the upgrade just didn't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right... save your money on this product..
