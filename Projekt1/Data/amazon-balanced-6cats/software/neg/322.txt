Norton old password manager worked much better.  It is a pain to use especially if you use the same password for serveral different websites.  After using it for a couple of weeks, most of the time not working properly, the final straw was that it suddenly stopped recognizing my Infovault password.  Several emails to Norton and nothing but worthless repsonses.  Hours wasted trying to get help from their website!  Even when I just wanted to know if I unstalled the product would password manager still work, no response.
