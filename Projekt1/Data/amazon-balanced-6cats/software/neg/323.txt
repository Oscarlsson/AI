I purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference. The password manager is quite useless. In more than half the times it did not enter passwords. In cases where it entered passwords, it took about 5 seconds to do so. It also asked me if I want to store passwords repeatedly for the same site.

It interfered with the operation. It did not let me go to sites like paypal and charles schwab. When I contacted Symantec support, their response is to disable the Phishing protection when I want to go to these sites.

My quicken started having problems. I had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is Confidential that is causing the problems. I would have given this s/w 0 stars if it is possible. Now, I uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it.

I can't believe that a company like Symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable
