I recently purchased this software and had to uninstall it.  In my case, I was unable to get into my Quicken account, which is password protected.  One of the features of Confidential is an "Information Vault" which stores all passwords.  I was prompted to enter the Quicken one as well, but chose not to as I felt this would defeat the purpose of having a password set up in the first place.  After that, when I would enter the Quicken password, my machine would just hang up.  The only way I could get in was by opening it in safe mode.  

I believe that this product sounds appealing on the surface, but when you get down to it, it promises more than it can deliver.  I also think that when it comes to internet security, the best solution is to take reasonable precaution.  If you respond to an e-mail requesting your account numbers and passwords, a software package is not going to save you.

I purchased this product based on my previous experience with Norton products and have been quite satisfied with their performance.  Thus, I was extremely disappointed with this product
