As others have noted, this product prevents AOL from loading on my machine - it just stalls (AOL is using a connection via Cable). It also "automatically" registers itself with Symantec and starts the counting of the 1 year subscription unless you cut of internet access. I removed it from that machine (a Toshiba Laptop) and installed it on my backup Dell (an older Pentium 3 866mhz). Both were running XP with the latest updates.  It slowed Internet Explorer to a crawl and locked it up when I attempted to first write this review.  It also slowed overall performance, when not in the browser, though this seems illogical.  I uninstalled it (it was the only Norton product on the machine) and it left Live Update installed until I manually started the removal of it. Fortunately everything is back to normal after removing all.  This is truly dangerous software for those with at least my type of equipment:  Stay away unless you have very poor browsing security and a machine that does not choke on it
