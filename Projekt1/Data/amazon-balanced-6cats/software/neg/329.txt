I purchased this updated version 1/5/07.  It does not print correctly, and technical support assured me that the developer is "working on the problem" and a "fix" is soon to come.  This is March 1, and no update is available yet.  This program is UN-USABLE and I am very unhappy and would not recommend "as is" to anyone.  I have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it.  This is a large embarrassment to the Hallmark company
