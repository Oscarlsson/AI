Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..

Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. 

However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..
