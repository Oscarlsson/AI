I bought this software to print my Christmas cards and much to my dismay, it did not print properly on my HP inkjet printer. I tried various settings with the same bad results and finally had to contact tech support via email.  Here is the reply:

"Thank you for contacting Hallmark Technical Support.

We apologize for any difficulties that you may have had with our software.

This is a newly found issue with the program.  The developers are currently working on an update that will correct this.  They said that the update should be out around Christmas.  Please routinely check for new updates by going to the Help menu and selecting the Check for Updates option.  When an update is available, you will be informed and it should automatically install the update."

This is a "printing" software so when it does not print properly, it indicates that the software was not tested properly or simply the publisher expect the users to be beta-testers!  If some other features that did not work, it may be excused, but this bug is unexcusable! 

I am sure the software developers will have the software bugs fixed, but at the meantime don't be a beta-tester,  buy someting else. Humbug!
