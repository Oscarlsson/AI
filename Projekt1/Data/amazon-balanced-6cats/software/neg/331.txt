I am a novice at web page creating and I am OVERLY glad I tried the free web trial (of course I lied about my address and my first born etc. that you MUST give to just get the so called "FREE" trial) this is the WORST web page editor for not so with it people.  It does not look anything even close to what frontpage had and again I am highly disappointed with it.  Where are the themes, web counters and the other simple to understand components ? I did try Namo Web Editor and for people like me, it is very good.  This may be wonderful for those of you who are very web page saavy but again if you are a novice don't get this or uprgrade to it, you will be HIGHLY disappointed
