I've been a loyal Norton anti-virus & utilities software customer since the stone age, but like several other reviewers, I'm deeply disappointed that Norton Internet Security 2007 is incompatible with ZoneAlarm Pro, Sunbelt CounterSpy, and Microsoft AntiSpyware, and even more deeply disappointed that I had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out. Once upon a time, Norton  was the epitome of well-designed, thoughtful, customer-centric software, but they've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name. I'll be returning Symantec's software if I can, and buying ZoneAlarm's A/V package instead
