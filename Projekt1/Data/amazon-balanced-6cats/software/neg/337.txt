When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I didn't have Flash 7.0 installed. Actually I had a later version of Flash (9.04) but of course Quickbooks couldn't handle that. Here's the fix: go to the Adobe site and download the uninstall program from them. Uninstall your flash player and then Quickbooks will then proceed. Good luck. Jo
