I bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant.  Well, after trying to use it for two years now, I'm ready to burn it. It's a great software for people who do their business by the projects, but it's not good for retail sales.  Everything has been a hassel, especially trying to set up the daily sales so I can record detailed inventory of my daily sales.  Yes, I noticed they did come out w/a new version for specifically for retail sales.  After I already invested in $300 in software and $100 in books just trying to learn this system.  What a waste!
