WHAT A BUNCH OF MONEY GRABBING IDIOTS!  IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING QUICKBOOKS, DON'T!!!!!!!  I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH A PRODUCT.  THEY TAKE FEATURES AWAY, ESPECIALLY WITH PAYROLL, IF YOU DO NOT BUY THEIR PRODUCTS.  THEN WHEN YOU CALL TO ASK WHAT IS GOING ON, THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE NOT PURCHASED THEIR SUPPORT PROGRAM AND THAT THEY CANNOT HELP YOU!!  

I HATE QUICK BOOKS.  THEIR IS NOTHING QUICK ABOUT IT AND THE SO CALLED SUPPORT STAFF ARE A BUNCH OF LIARS!!
