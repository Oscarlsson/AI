Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break.  I have a very small business, so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.  

The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated.
The customer service was no help - couldn't answer my questions.  I ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted.

I've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since I've spent the money, but I'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime.  If this is "Quick Books,"  I need to find "Lightning Fast" Books somewhere
