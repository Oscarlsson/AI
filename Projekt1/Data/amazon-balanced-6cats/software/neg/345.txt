What a terrible upgrade.  I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6.  Even though I specifically told it to leave my file associations alone, it changed every one of them.  It's a nightmare.  I'm still trying to get Nero disassociated with certain file types, to no avail.  The backup program is awful, slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6.  Overall, Ultra 6 is a much better product.  I'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to Nero with instructions on where they can associate it
