The computer that I bought June 2006 came with Nero 6 OEM version.  It has worked very well.  I finally got around to clicking on the upgrade icon and ordered what I thought would be a serial number to unlock some features.  It turns out that is not available, and I have bought the Nero 7 Ultra version, which required a 195 MB download. Having dialup, I was not pleased.  I asked for my money back.  No response.  I faxed BBB complaint with copies to Nero offices in California and Germany. The office in Germany responded with email that they do not do refunds. Los Angeles BBB has been unresponsive. 
I finally got the download from a computer with broadband. I uninstalled Nero 6 and set restore point.  I installed Nero 7.  It worked!  But it was agonizingly slow.  I don't mean the CD or DVD writing per se was slow. When I eventually got it going that gave me the full speed of my hardware. However navigating from each click to response felt like it was in a 486 and not an Athlon 64.  I think other programs were also rendered more sluggish in opening files.
I uninstalled Nero 7, and just to be safe I then used restore point from before I installed it. I reinstalled Nero 6. What a relief!  There may be some fancy features Nero 6 OEM lacks, but it's worth it to have the computer working at reasonable speed. If I want to rip a music track to a .wav file (a feature lacking in the OEM version), it's easier to reboot to linux and run K3b than put up with sluggish Nero 7 Ultra to do it.

A product and company gone bad; Nero 7 is definitely not recommended
