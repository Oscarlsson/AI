I'm in the midst of auditioning LCD panels and the local ISF certified guy wants $350 per panel to calibrate them. I like TV and everything, but there's just no way that I am going to spend $350 on TV that I might possibly keep. 

Still, the store settings on any two panels have two problems. First, they are amped up beyond compare as the TV vendors compete to be "who's the brightest" on the lit showroom floor. Sitting in my living room, they are far far too bright to watch. Second, they display colors totally differently. It's just hard to compare to 2 sets that are calibrated so differently.

Now the TVs that we are looking at cost a pretty penny, and it seemed that a couple of hundred dollars to inform the decision was a good idea, just like the hundred dollars for an HDMI splitter seemed like a good idea. The splitter was a good idea, the Spyder TV Colormeter not so much.

I calibrated 2 panels with this product. Two things are true about the calibrations. First, they do not look at all the same. The Sony panel has red shifted flesh tones while the Sharp looks cold and sterile. Second, they look way way worse than before the calibration. After 20 minutes of watching Casino Royale, it was time to revert back to a toned down version of the factory defaults for each.

At first I thought that I had not followed the instructions right. Maybe it was not dark enough. Maybe the sensor was not positioned right. Having done the process several times, I can state categorically that while the colorvision Spyder TV may not deliver good results, it is consistent in its delivery of bad results. 

I simply cannot recommend this product
