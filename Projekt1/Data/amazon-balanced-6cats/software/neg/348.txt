I have the same problem that Xrayman does.
I was wondering if I had a faulty unit since it was an "opened" item and slightly discounted in the store where I bought it. I guess I'm not the only one who has this problem. My TV is a Plasma, for whatever that's worth. And I too found that the SpyderTV did not set things correctly. Color was much too saturated, and contrast and brightness were not correct. The only thing it did do was correctly choose the color temperature, which I do think is better than what I had it set to, so I'm now using SpyderTV's recommended color temp. But I reset everything else back to the settings I had already achieved by eye. I am going to try it out on an old CRT television and see if it works any better on that.

My plasma isn't new, and I would recommend that people do not use this product on a new plasma.  It requires you to put a bright white square up on your screen for far too long.  I had to run through 15 color temperature settings, letting SpyderTV take a reading on each one, while leaving the bright square up.  Took at least 7 minutes.  That will temporarily burn the square into a new plasma screen.  ...and might throw off the remaining measurements that have to be taken
