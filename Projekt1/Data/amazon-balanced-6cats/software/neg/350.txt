Great software! Until You have a question or a problem that is. Then You get the run around BIG TIME! ZoneAlarm says they didn't sell it to me so they can't help me. They send me to Broderbund for help. Broderbund then sends me to Encore for help and they won't help me either. ZoneAlarm states if I didn't buy it right from ZoneAlarm then they don't give any support. 
 It comes in a ZoneAlarm box, says ZoneAlarm on the CD but apparently it isn't ZoneAlarm??? (According to ZoneAlarm that is)!!
 Buy it elsewhere, or end up helpless!!!
