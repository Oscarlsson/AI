I have used the Zonlabs Firewall for several years. It works fine. I can not say the same for the Security Suite. The AntiSpam function does not update definitions and ZoneLabs Tech Support know they have a problem. They are working on it but no date for a fix.
Do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed.
