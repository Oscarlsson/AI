I really like the Rosetta Stone product (although it is over priced).

WARNING: Rosetta Stone (Fairfield Language Technologies) will NOT replace a CD if it is lost, stolen or damaged unless you bought the product DIRECTLY from them (and then they charge you $30 for a replacement CD).  I had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package.  In this case I can get my money back from the store I bought it from but since you can't backup the disks you had better be VERY careful to not lose one
