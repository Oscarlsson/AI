Many repetitions are necessary in order to acquire a second language or a third, but the monotony of this program does not keep your interest for long, is so boring and offers not variety at all. This program will take away the excitement for learning another language even for the most motivated individuals, and will not help to acquire fluency because it does not equip you with the tools to construct language on your own. 

It does not contain essential grammar instruction, it is an error to suppose that the same grammatical rules of your language can be applied to other languages (French is not a translation of English, or Spanish, or any other language). Grammar becomes essential especially when you are trying to construct correct structures on your own; this program claims to help you learn "naturally" but leaves huge gaps by neglecting grammar, culture, conversational structures, and clear understanding, not natural!

For adults translation is necessary when trying to internalize the concepts, adults already have an understanding of language and are equipped to learn differently than children, sometimes even faster. I do not believe that "learning a second language like a child" is an accurate statement to describe this program, children are immersed in the culture, everything around them is the "real deal", not repetitious pictures and recordings. Children receive verbal and non-verbal input constantly, and adults have greater cognition than children do. 

Looking at a picture while you listen a recoding might give you a vague idea of what it means, but there is not accuracy. It is very unlikely that you will internalize a concept that you do not fully understand. Rosetta Stone approach might be very effective when memorizing vocabulary and simple sentences, but I could achieve the same by purchasing flash cards for a fraction of the cost of this overrated, and overpriced program.
