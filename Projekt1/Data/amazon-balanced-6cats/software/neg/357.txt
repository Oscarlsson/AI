I've used the past few versions of Acrobat and this one is a disappointment. Navigation is a pain. Instead of the familiar window and arrows at the bottom of a page Adobe's engineers have moved navigation to the top of the page and have only a single arrow.The whole look and feel is most unMac-like, more like a windows application. I suppose if I wanted to take the time and energy to study the user manual I would find the application friendlier but I don't expect to have to re-learn to use an application when I upgrade. If you're thinking of upgrading, my advice is don't
