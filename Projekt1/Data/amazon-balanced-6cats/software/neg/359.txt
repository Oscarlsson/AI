I upgraded from Wordperfect Office 12 to X3, but have returned the upgrade to Wordperfect.  The much touted ability to import PDF files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable.  In addition, the Wordperfect Mail component will not load data files while my antivirus (ZoneAlarm) is running in the background.  Corel Technical Support takes no responsibility for the incompatability.  Do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed
