I have many (too many) Rosetta Stone softwares for language learning, however after purchasing "Tell Me More" software I will never go back to Rosetta Stone. It is true that you can learn a lot of vocabulary with Rosetta's program but that is about it! Rosetta's software is very illogical! Honestly, do not waste your time and money with this program, check Tell Me More and you will be amazed
