I have been using this product now for almost a year. The only reason I insist using it is because I feel really bad for wasting my money. First, this is not worth $300 bucks.
There are only still pictures and sound. No movies or any fancy graphics, so why the price? Second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences. Third, the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all. You keep memorizing thins like "the boy is under the airplane" or "the ball is on the boy's head".
Initially I thought, well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad. But then I took a look at the last lessons; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue. 
I cannot recommend you another course because I spent so much in this one that I do not want to try again and get disappointed. Don't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like I was. This is definitively NOT worth 300 dollars. It is not even useful for basic converstion. I have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library.
Ah, and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar ..
