Being a PC user for many years (since 1985)I have come through all the versions of MS operating systems (does anyone out there remember 3.5!) MS has also piggy backed this "robust" office product for 20 years.  Their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar.  This is no exception, but this time I like the tool bar!  As to ease of use, I use PowerPoint and Word often and my spouse uses Excel.  If there were an easier product available we would buy it but then Windows XP would kill it on sight and Vista would stop working altogether.  Why does MS think that everyone but those working in a professional since (hence Office for Professionals) needs all the junk they subject us to?  Do those guys in Redmond still think adult users of the PC like "cute" things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question!  I am tired of Beta testing MS products for so many years but as a PC user I am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system, other than Mac, we are all stuck with them.
