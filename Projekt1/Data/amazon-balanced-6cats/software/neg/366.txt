Office 2007 may seem ok at first.  The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch.  But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.

1)  Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well
2)  Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste'
3)  The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 2003
4)  Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.

I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws.  There is no reason for me to upgrade.

I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.

I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.

Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft.  (so what's new?
