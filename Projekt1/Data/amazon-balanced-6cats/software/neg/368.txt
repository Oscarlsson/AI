Unfortunately, it seems once you have downloaded NAV 2007, your whole computer will not function properly. Internet Explorer malfunctions, and I also received a blue screen (fear of crash) stating that what ever program was recently installed, I should reinstall it. I did so, but the problems did not go away. I called Norton, they told me to run in safe mode without norton. My computer was back to normal, so it was Norton causing all the problems. I unistalled it and went with another product, after spending the $60 and many hours with Norton help desk. Don't believe me, do a search on any search engine, and you will see the many problems and no apparent solutions for this program!! Up till now, I have only used Norton, and never thought twice when buying the update. I'm now moving on to another product
