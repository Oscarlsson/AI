I'm responsible for 10 computers at our organization. Last year we purchased Norton Antivirus 2006. It was such a resource hog that it stopped our older computers (550 Mhz) from working and I had to uninstall from all computers. After reading reviews that said 2007 was leaner, I tried to install this on 6 computers. Only 1 install went without problems. Installing on three other computers took 3 days, and I'm still not through with computer 5. Sometimes the program won't install. Once it crashes during install, it leaves behind broken code that prevents reinstall unless you use the Norton uninstall tool, which removes ALL Norton products. So in addition to uninstalling and reinstalling Antivirus, you also have to reinstall Norton Ghost or any other Norton products. On the computer I'm still fighting with the install went smoothly, but during the update the program hung up and now I can't open Norton Antivirus. Even worse, when I open a Word document, the Norton Antivirus starts scanning the document and freezes the computer.  What a nightmare
