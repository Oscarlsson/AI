Norton is still the 800LB. Gorilla of Antivirus software, but I think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better!  
The old days when Peter Norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone, and these days Norton is just a mass produced product of Symantec's.
Customer service is through an Internet Database, and you must pay over $40 just to speak with someone even when Norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in.  The biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources.  It is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on Norton these days. I bought Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and have not looked back.  There product is less expensive and includes free phone support, and they have received all sorts of awards for their product
