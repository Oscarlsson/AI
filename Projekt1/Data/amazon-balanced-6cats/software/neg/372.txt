Quickbooks "sunsetted" my previous version, forcing me to buy this horriblle, buggy software.  It lacks many of the features that I liked from my previous version (2003), runs much slower, uses 10 times as much memory, and is full of bugs.  I regularly need to run Windows system restore when all of my company data disappears.  Avoid this product at all costs.  Time that I used to spend on more important business functions is now spent trying to get this crappy software to work.  I have used Quickbooks for 12 years, and 4 editions, but this will be my last Intuit product.  I wish I could give it 0 stars
