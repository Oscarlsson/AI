I've tried to be a loyal Quickbooks Pro user for 5 years now and at first this company provided a competent accounting product that was decent after you learned its idiosyncracies. But each year you will be forced to update ($$$) or your tax tables will not be accurate, and each year some of the capabilities will be lost and you will have to pay for them to be restored ($$$), each year the program will be more expensive to update($$$). I am not an unreasonable business owner and I don't mind paying for good service, but Intuit has turned into a unethical, money grubbing monster. They sunset and disable your software every time you download an update,  forcing updates and buying previously provided services (payroll tax tables, e-mailing invoices, printing 1099 and W2). This is especially true at year end, becuase they know they have you in a tax/year end crunch. Now they are even doing unauthorised billing of new services (last year they started charging quarterly fees for tax tables--this year they charge a mandatoy $300 payroll update as well as a $100 software update for the program itself.) Furthermore they charge your credit card without permission under the ruberic that its the same as the quarterly tax table fee. Honestly, consider some other program! This deceptive practice of software disabling and data blocking, combined with the dubious practice of sunsetting software every year has grown intolerable. I hope they get the class action suit they deserve.
