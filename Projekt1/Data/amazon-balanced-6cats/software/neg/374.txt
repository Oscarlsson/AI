I regret having purchased this product.  I have not been able to use it for two months, after finally giving up trying to get it to work.  I have a very nice laptop running Windows XP Home, and encountered many problems.  I tried all of the avenues available to me through QuickBooks, online, via email, and on the telephone.  I spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of.  Here are just a few:  The program would not convert my Quicken data; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid; None of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info, after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks.  I spent 2 & 1/2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that I was unable to speak to a customer service person who's first language was English.  Each time I was on the phone, the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem, then he/she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try, then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was.  Not helpful in any way, though very polite. I'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed, convoluted, over-complicated, non-user-friendly item which I would like to toss over a cliff.
