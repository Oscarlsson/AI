I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam
