Installed this on my laptop and desktop computers.  One installation was late in 2005, the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006.  Both have tried to fail.  The laptop will no longer do automatic updates.  I can manually download and install the updates, but it is a bit of a hassle.  The desktop will no longer download the Symantec updates at all.  I attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls, won't do it.  The only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers.  Because of the problems, I've run into several problems, mostly related to .cab files when I attempt downloads.  I've switched to AVG and Zone Alarm - both FREE and they work
