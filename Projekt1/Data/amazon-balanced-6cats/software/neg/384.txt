I recently tried to update my Norton Systemworks.  Halfway through the update, I got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old Norton Systemworks.  I tried to back out of the installation at that point, but was unable.  I called the Norton company, spent an hour on the phone with a tech, only to have them tell me it was my computer.  I assured them that I was just using my computer, which was fine, and now it doesn't work.  They told me there was nothing further that they could do, and that I would have to call a computer service company.  I found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system, causing me to lose everything on my hard drive, and requiring a new operating system.  I have run into other people who had exactly the same problem, with no help from the Norton Company.  I will never again buy a Norton product.  I only wish I could get my money back from them.
