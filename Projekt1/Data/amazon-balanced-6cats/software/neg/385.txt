I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment.

1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible.

2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system.

3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years

4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!)

5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there?

During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product.

Cheers, Joh
