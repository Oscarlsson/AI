I "upgraded" to NORTON'S 2006 Version of Internet Security and Virus Protection software online. Included was Norton SystemWorks. I have used Norton anti-viral software exclusively for several years without any major problems. And yes, I always remove my previous version, before adding new software. Even though my internet connection is via private satellite antenna, it took almost two hours for the product to download and install.  Then when I rebooted my laptop (a new high-end Sony Vaio with Windows XP), it froze up during startup. I won't go into all the hassle involved, but after THREE removals and downloads over a period of several weeks, it became apparent that there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with NORTON'S 2006 Product. It caused crashes on almost a daily basis, and updates always took an excessive amount of time. Customer service was no help at all, and the company refused to refund my purchase price. I've since switched to a different brand of anti-viral internet protection software and have had no more problems with my computer. After this experience, I will NEVER use NORTON products again. The only reason I gave this a 1-star rating is because it's the lowest rating available. It should actually be MINUS 5 STARS for the aggravation and time and money wasted
