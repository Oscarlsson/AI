I've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported PaintShopPro and Corel products. I have to say I am very disappointed in the new version, PSPXI. 

No problems with the download, but the program crashes easily, you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9, basically is slower in everything you do. I am a photographer, and looked forward to the new photo features, which work, but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it. Just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between.

I have searched the net and support wise, the upgrades and patches have not helped. Corel is not solving the problem and maybe they can't. This is not a PC problem which they so want us to believe. I have plenty of memory and speed on my PC. It may be something involving how the XI stores it's cache. Not sure. But the changes are not workable, sadly.

I think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that Corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with, or they will find themselves out of the PS market. This is not just me talking, it has happened to alot of loyal fans. Because it could be the better than Photoshop if they fix it.  If you really want the program, download the free trial first and or try the X or 9 version, especially if your PC is an older model.
