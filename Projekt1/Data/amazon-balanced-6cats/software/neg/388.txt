I buy this dvd from Amazon and try to play it but my desktop can't read any data on the dvd, like it's blank. So I send it back for a replacement and it has the same problem. Both my desktops can't read any data on the dvd but my laptop can play it fine. Next I contact Git Corp and they say burning software can conflict with it so I uninstall Nero and it still wont work.
Git Corp says they don't know what the problem is and passes it to their developers. I haven't heard back from them. All 3 comps run XP, 3 different dvd drives, don't know what's wrong! I have no problems playing the Avengers, Spiderman, or X-Men dvds
