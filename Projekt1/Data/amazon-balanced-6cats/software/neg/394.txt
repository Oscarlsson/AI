I'm an amateur photographer and I use Photoshop CS2 for most of my digital editing.  I decided I needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that I have read on digital editing.  

I had to download an update of the software program before I could start using my Spyder.  This procedure alone took several hours because I kept getting "error" messages.  I can't count how many times I unloaded and reloaded the program.  I was eventually able to run the program, however, every time I calibrated my one year old Emachine CRT monitor, it left me with an orange color cast on my screen.  I worked with ColorVision technical support for many frustrating hours.  The technical support person I was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me.  They even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective.  Unfortunately I was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor.  After several weeks of trying to get the Spyder2 Express to calibrate my monitor, I gave up.  I just didn't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned.  I really wanted it to work.  I'm back to using Adobe Gamma.
