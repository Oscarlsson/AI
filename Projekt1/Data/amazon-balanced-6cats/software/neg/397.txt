Unlike versions up to No. 6, this version require authorization. This means that a single use version can't be loaded on multiple computers. Adobe informed me that this was not a bug and wanted me to buy multiple copies eventhough I am only using one computer at a time. This version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install. When I found out that my legal version couldn't be used, it forced me to reinstall version 6, this took almost an hour to install, reboot, un-install and reinstall the orginal version. Why is Adobe the only company that forces this? Their program installation don't even skip from one set of four numbers to the next. They force you to type the dashes between the numbers. 

If you have multiple computers stay away from anything above version 6
