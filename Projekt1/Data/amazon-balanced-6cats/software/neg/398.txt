Worked okay until I installed XP Service Pack 2.  Now I can no longer scan using my Brother MFC-9700 and Paperport 9.  It has been a long time since Service Pack 2 was released, and Scansoft has left everyone who bought Paperport 9 in the cold.  I could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with SP2.  This kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business.  Don't take my word for it.  Google the issue, and you'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers.  From now on, I'll avoid Scansoft
