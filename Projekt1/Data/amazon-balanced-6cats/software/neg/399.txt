I was very excited to get this product.  It scans well, files well, is very sexy and promising.  Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords.  Oooops!  It won't search!!
If you don't know already, PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call.  After that it's $20 a pop.  The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program.  Okay, but it still wouldn't search.  Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2.  Uh uh, no way.  Nada.  That's when I asked for a refund.
I bought MyCab for $40.  Tech support is marvelous, within one hour over the Internet.  The only thing it doesn't do is scan within the program, but then I can do that, can't I?
