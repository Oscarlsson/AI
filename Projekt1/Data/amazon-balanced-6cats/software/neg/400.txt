I have used both Paperport 8 and Paperport 9 Deluxe for over a year so I am qualified to report.

Both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with Windows XP Pro.  

I cannot really get version 9 to operate.  Everytime I try its like cold molasses.  Click...wait....wait....wait...wait...and then lock up.

I'm very experienced.  I've been working with PCs since 1991.  Every other piece of software I've loaded works very well...except for Paperport 8 and 9.

In theory Paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to PDF which is more or less a universal file format.  However theory is a lot better than reality.

Support is nonexistent from ScanSoft.  If you pay the $19.95 per incident, you still do not get a solution.

The ScanSoft forum is always either not working (another bad sign) or it's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support.

Unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives, but doQments looks promising.

Avoid Paperport unless you have money and time to waste
