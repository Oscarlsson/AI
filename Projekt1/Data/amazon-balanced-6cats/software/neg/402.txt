I got my DVD a few weeks back and discovered I could not read any of the files form the 1990s. I tried on several computers I have in the house and came to realize that the DVD is defective. I contacted Gitcorp about the problem and they informed me they would send me a replacement disc. 

Problem is that after nearly four weeks there hasn't been any DVD and repeated attempts to contact Gitcorp has resulted in no reponses.

Update, after continued emails to Gitcorp, I finally got a replacment DVD. They didn't even ask to see the original bad DVD. So my rating of this product would go up if I could. If you buy the product, check it closely, and get in touch with Gitcorp as soon as you find any problems. They can be very slow about responding
