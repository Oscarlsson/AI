The game is called Fritz and Chesster. Fritz is the boy. Chester is a rat. That girl you see in the picture, her name is Bianca. She never actually plays. She just says things like "Well done, brave knight!" and asks stupid questions. At one point poor Bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece, and Fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father. The tone and context are extremely anti-woman, in my opinion. He also counters by saying that boys are smarter. 

It seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece "she". To take the queen down a notch, they refer to a group or queens as a harem. To demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can. A male voice says, "Off you go," in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind.
