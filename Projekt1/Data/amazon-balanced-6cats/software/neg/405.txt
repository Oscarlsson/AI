I agree with reviewer Mr. Dietz.  I was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on Amazon for $24.99.  Put it in and loaded it in.  This game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all. No help menu either.  We wasted at least 2 hours on it before I ejected it and apologized to her.  There is nothing here to learn chess from
