I was looking for an intructional CD to help my daughter to learn chess.  I read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what I was looking for.  WRONG!

First of all, the CD comes with no instruction book and you're left to try and figure out what you're supposed to do by yourself (good luck). I've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and I still haven't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess.

I've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them.

Save your money and your sanity and don't buy this CD.
