I am a software tech. I first "free trial" V6 online-
1. Finds 131 errors, but will only fix 4 (must buy full version!). SHEESH!
2. Buy full version with 20% off coupon (3 computer lic, for only $9.95 more- their web site).
3. Does NOT remove left/overs..., from old uninstalled pgms. (Fix-it Utilities "6" safely did- read my review).
4. Then they only support updates... for 1 year- auto-renew! RIP-OFF!

I got a refund, and will NEVER use them again
