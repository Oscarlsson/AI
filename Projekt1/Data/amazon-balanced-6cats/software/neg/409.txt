Be warned, this product does not support all advertised features on all phones.  Right out of the box I found it did not support 2 of our 4 cell phones.  Of the phones that it did support, the only sync features available were photo downloading and calendar sync.  The ability to transfer other data such as movies, contacts and ring tones were not available for my particular phone.  Without all of the advertised features are available I consider this a complete waste of money
