I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE.
