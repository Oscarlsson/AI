We were big fans of TaxCut, especially after Turbo added spyware ..... THIS YEAR'S TAX CUT has irreguarities that are costing ($$) me ......... for example, you file your college student's return and check the box that she/he will be an exemption on the head-of-household return & then comes the surprise, head-of-household can't file their return with that college student as an exemption, despite checking the proper boxes! ....... for example, it can't caluculate railroad retirement benefits ..... for example, it tells you that your return is a-okay, you pay $15, then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another $15 to refile! ........ good-bye Tax Cut!
