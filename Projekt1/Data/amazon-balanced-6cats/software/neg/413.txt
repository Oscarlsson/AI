H&R block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H&R Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do
