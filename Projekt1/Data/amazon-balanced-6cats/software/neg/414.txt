Two weeks ago I attempted to do my taxes on this software.  However, it couldn't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so I could file.  I had two weeks until the update was available.  I downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told I had a credit of $3,100.  However, it never added this number to my total tax credits.  All customer support could come up with was "Start over from scratch, don't even import your information from last year's Taxcut".  Never again
