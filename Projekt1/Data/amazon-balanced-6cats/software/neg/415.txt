Microsoft continues their legacy of software that doesn't work. I've been using Windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems Microsoft has released. You would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this, instead it is many steps backwards. BTW, I have a 4400 AMD, 3 gigs of ram, and can say that Vista is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on XP. Cool interface, about the only positive thing about Vista I have found so far. Searches are also much faster, but hardly a reason to upgrade. Be prepared for Windows Updates after installing Vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working. I'm tempted to go back to XP, so needless to say a big waste of time and effort.
