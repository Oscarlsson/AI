I have thought well of every operating system since DOS 3.1.  This is without a doubt the worst system I have ever seen.  Not only is it NOT graphicaly intuitive, it is incompatible with most all of my 32 bit software.  Trying to use Quicken will crash the computer.  It is going to cost a bundle to upgrade all of a person's softwarein order to use Vista.  The only thing you will get out of running Vista is a lot of headaches
