I paid top dollar for PS7 and thought it was time to upgrade to CS2.  After I installed CS2 I discovered that I could not crop any photo without having my PC crash.  Every time it crashed I looked at the defrag utility and I had fragmented files all over the place.  Then I defraged the hard drive and went back to CS2 and tried to crop the same photo again.  Again, my PC hung up and was unresponsive and the defrag utility said I had to defrag.  The only thing I did was to crop one photo in CS2, and that was enough to make it necessary to defrag again.  I uninstalled this piece of garbage from my PC.  It does not work, and I don't care what Deke McClelland says and I don't believe what he says, either. Save your money.  These rip-off artists at Adobe are nothing but thieves.  Yeah, they ripped me off for $153 but you know what?  At least I have my integrity, and that's more than you got, Deke baby.
