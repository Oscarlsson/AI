The new  look is very nice.

BUT, when you install, you have also to keep the previous version (in well behaved software, automatically the previous version is cleaned... not here).

The system of validation of License through Internet for the physical machine is fine, I just hope that I will not have a disk crash and then waste time to be authorised to re-install a product that I rightfully paid (and at such a price).

Well, make sure you:
- do not try to de-install 5,5 after the install of CS2 (or bye-bye the license)
- have a clean and robust backup of your installation....

I am not sure I will make the next upgrade....
