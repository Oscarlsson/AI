I should have ordered thru Amazon to avoid the confusion, since they state the vercsion needed, but where I ordered from did not mention the 5.5 version requirement, and on the box cover, THERE IS NO STIPULATION ABOUT THIS, only a generic statement that a previous version is required. How hard would it be for them to print on the box what versions will and will not work??????

Adobe Customer Service would not budge, so I am returning the product. Of course, Christmas is ruined for the person I bought this for, and I am out shipping and handling charges. Thank you Adobe. Obviously, I can't recommend anyone buy from Adobe at this point. It's easy to see why warez are popular when companies are this foolish
