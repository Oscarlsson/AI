I wanted a new computer, so a couple months ago I ordered an HP computer that happened to have Vista on it.  I thought, "oh great, I'll get the newest OS as well"... major mistake.

1. Didn't work with my perhipherals, including my scanner and an HP PRINTER.  For god's sake, the COMPUTER'S AN HP, why won't it work with an HP printer!?  If they knew the drivers for perhipherals weren't ready, why the did they release the OS and force us to buy it?

2. Annoying security feautres, constantly asking permissions to install software.  Just like the Apple ads-- a total joke.

3. After struggling with the damn thing for 2 days, I decided to try to install old trusty xp on it... $200 later, guess what?  You CANT INSTALL an earlier operating system!  Booting from the CD doesn't work either, you get the blue screen of death.  Maybe some tech geek can do it, but I'm done wasting time with this thing.

4. All that agony, for what?  The "fancy" interface?  Who cares what it looks like, I just want to use my damn scanner!  I'm sure all those slick effects suck up RAM and resources, for what functional purpose?  Just to look more like mac?

5. ... Speaking of which, I am now switching to.  Goodbye windows, after 15 years of struggling with your crappy software, I'm done
