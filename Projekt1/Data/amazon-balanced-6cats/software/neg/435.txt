My computer was running fine until I tried to upgrade.  First it took almost 2 hours to install at the last 3% it found a error and was going to roll back.  Well it never did.  It erased everything.  It went to a dos prompt. Called help line and it took 3 hours to just reload.  When it was done, I had no files or any of my programs on the hard drive.  Not only that but he said I had to install again to register.  It takes forever to install.  Took forever to get in touch with someone, they were in Nova Scotia, and I still do not have a working computer.  I have to try and get a recover program to get my files back.  I recommend staying away from this product for upgrades.
