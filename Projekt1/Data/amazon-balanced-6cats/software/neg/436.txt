You can bet those people gaving Vista a good rating here, work for the company.  It's a piece of JUNK.  If you have a good working XP, or anything else, please don't buy Vista.  I bought it a month ago already installed on a good HP computer.  I've worked on it from sun-up to sun-down for a month and still, all I've got is a pile of junk.  And, it's so slow, that you have to take a coffee break while it's gathering up a program to run.  Don't buy their One-Care either.  I've owned Windows since "98".  I'm considering re-installing my old HP/XP.  It's still here in the closet
