I just bought this yesterday, and though the product description here on Amazon says it's compatible with Windows 98 and Windows ME, the packaging says "TaxCut USB Drive is compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP."  All our taxes for several years have been done on a Windows ME computer with a USB port.  Now what?  HELP!
