I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. "Nope, can't do it" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, "you'll have to use another product." So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year.
