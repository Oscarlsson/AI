Unlike years past, H&R Block (founded by a guy named Bloch) decided to charge $16 for each e-file, Federal or state.  Only one version, "Premium Federal+State+E-file" includes a "free" Federal e-file and state e-file; but that version costs $70, so there's no free lunch at all.  Seriously, $16 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!

I don't work for any of these companies, nor any tax-related company, nor any such entity.  I just don't think it's right for H&R Block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing, whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere.  BTW, if you use Taxcut to prepare your return, you'll have to use H&R Block's e-filing service if you want to e-file; you can't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.

Good luck
