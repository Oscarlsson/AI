This software messed up my computer big time.  It does something first of all, to Microsoft word.  Word does not work properly after installation of Photo Explosion.  It then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up.  At first I only suspected it to be Photo Explosion.  I had to have my computer sent back to HP.  When I got it back I reinstalled Photo Explosion and the same thing happenend.  BE CAREFUL.  Product has BIG PROBLEMS - WHICH WILL GIVE YOU BIGGER PROBLEMS - I GUARANTEE IT.
