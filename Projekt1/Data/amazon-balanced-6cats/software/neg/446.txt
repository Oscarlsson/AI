The editing portion of the software is completly separate from the CD portion of the software and does not store in the same file. CD's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500. I was told by Nova Development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the CD writer was a free add on to the program. The box and program info did not indicate that. I offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere
