Once again, Microsoft has proven they can churn out some new schlock overnight, filled with bugs, with limited usefulness. The greeting card section was the most amusing to me- it prints out great looking cards with upside down text beginning at the bottom of the inside of the card. In short, the cards section is buggy and you can sink hours trying to maneuver around it and look for solutions online. I make pc cards all the time and I can say this program sucks. The help section answers nothing, but MS will gadly charge you $35 per question for support. Some huge sections of MS Works is just made up of links to internet sites that one can find easily by using any search engine; I call this fatuous redundancy. The loading for some parts, like the calendar, is slow even on a very powerful computer. This is one of the most useless and shoddy programs I have ever used in my ENTIRE life. It is a waste of space on my pc and will be used rarely if at all. It's hilarious they are charging around $50 for it. This is a $9.99 bargain bin kinda thing. Don't buy it. My pc came with it and that's the ONLY reason it's there.
