Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad. 

I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this. 

Recommendation:  Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE
