I have used Taxcut and TurboTax on and off for years.  TurboTax tends to have less problems.  This year Taxcut was incredibly difficult.  First it would not properly import the data from DeductionPro.  Then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information.  Finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data.  Also,  when I received the Taxcut email that the IRS had accepted my return I logged on to Taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number.  Taxcut would not recognize that I had efiled and would not check for the dcn.  I had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone.  Because of these delays I have still not finished with the state return.  I don't know if I will buy this product again.
