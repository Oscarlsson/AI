Found the registration number difficult to read. Had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time! The I's look like 1's. Tried it again! I got it to load. My computer slowed down significantly! Certain sites I could not access anymore without re-configuring the software. I have used Norton. MCaffee or whatever, and other suite type security software. This one was the worst. I would not recommend it. I got a well deserved refund
