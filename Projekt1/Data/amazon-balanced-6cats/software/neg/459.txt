This was the most user unfriendly Turbotax I have ever used.  The Schedule C imported misinformation, had to keep forcing in the correct info. And I just found out my State taxes were received showing I owed a completely different amount than what I had electronically filed.  I have used this program for years, but after this, NEVER AGAIN!!! Let this be a warning to others
