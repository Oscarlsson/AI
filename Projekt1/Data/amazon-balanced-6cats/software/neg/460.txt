I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year.  What a fool I was.  This years program was a nightmare.  I will never purchase it again.  Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted.  Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time.  It got to the point I quit going back to check.  It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct.  I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend.  Next year I will try a different product.  ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult.  There were hidden pages in something called "quick zoom" or some such thing.  I could never figure out where I was.  Thanks for the headache Turbotax
