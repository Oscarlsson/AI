I had the exact same experience as another reviewer. ....loved it for years...changed formats...no confidence. At the last minute I had to use an accountant. The accountant cost me $650.00. $50 more than what I was over paying in taxes using this software. A disaster. It doesn't look like it was importing data correctly, state navigation really was painful. I buy this software to try different senerios (Joint or single)...but this year it wouldn't do that. Probably because they worry too much about getting paid for every user and not enough to assist people who bought the software.

To my mind the software is crippled
