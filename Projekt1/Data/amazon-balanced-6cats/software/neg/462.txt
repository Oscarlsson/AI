I have used Turbo Tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it. This year however some "genius" decided to change the entire format and approach and I found this year's version to be terrible. Very confusing now when used to be clear and simple. Hard to even download, confusing up dates, difficult to find numerous frequently used items (estimated taxes paid in previous year, capital gains/losses, state taxes paid, and more). The running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed. 
   I have zero confidence in this year's program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years. Have recommended Turbo Tax to many over the years, but would strongly recommend against buying this year's product. A perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it. Suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software, this one stinks
