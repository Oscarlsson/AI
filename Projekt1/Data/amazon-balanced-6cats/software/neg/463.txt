I bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and PC magazines.  The product's performance was OK, but customer service was a headache.  The serial number on the CD that was shipped to me came up as "invalid" when I tried to install the software.  I had to call customer service, who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid.  Now, one year later I want to upgrade my software to the current version (to save $$ over a new purchase) and guess what?  My serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the Trend site I will have to pay more than what Amazon would charge me for a brand new CD.  I will most likely switch to ZoneAlarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product
