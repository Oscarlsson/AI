If I could give less than 1 star for any Trend Micro product I would. It gives too many false positives when you don't even have a virus. You are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as Trend told you there was. Avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money. It's a piece of crap.
