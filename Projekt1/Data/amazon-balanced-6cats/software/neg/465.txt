My subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew.  They are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software.  2005 works fine until I have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support.  I won't pay for their telephone customer support, trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this.  Shame on you pcillin
