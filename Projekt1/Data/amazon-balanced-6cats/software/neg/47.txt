First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.

But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.

It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy.
