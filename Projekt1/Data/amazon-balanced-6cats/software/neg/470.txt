This software only got one star because I couldnt give it a zero.  It never worked on my Windows XP computer.  I couldnt open the program, couldnt close it, couldnt get the sytem to shut down.  After a hard shutdown, Windows would not start.  Tech support couldnt figure out the problem.  I uninstalled Panda, reinstalled Norton and system is working fine.  I would not recommend
