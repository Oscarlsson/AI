I bought this 1 week ago at a local Staples.. The box makes it sound like the solution to all your problems.. It also says they offer tech support 24 X 365.. 

Sounds great.... the problem is..it will not install on my computer. I keep getting a message to remove NORTON ANITVIRUS before I can install Panda. I removed NORTON and it no longer can be found thru control panel, remove software or thru a search of my hard drive.

PANDA still will not install. I keep getting the same message. UNINSTALL NORTON.

So I tried to contact tech support per the box. I found out they offer tech support 24 x 365 via email. I have sent 3 emails in a week and have received no response. 

Bottom line is I have a product I cannot use.. TECH SUPPORT does not exist. It deserves 0 stars in my book. Spend your money somewhere else
