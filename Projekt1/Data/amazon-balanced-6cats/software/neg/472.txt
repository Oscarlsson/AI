As a teacher I use Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher when working with students AND engaging in professional activities (presentations to organizations, etc.)  I have been using Office 2002, and thought I should upgrade.  BIG mistake.  The ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through, especially since I previously just customized the toolbar so everything I needed was immediately available.  I'm still trying to figure out how to type in Chinese, although the Spanish and German are working fine.  Additionally, they've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons/icons/etc.  As a previous commenter noted, making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems, and I also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber.  It took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual, and I ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar.

The designs in Publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate.  In previous versions, you could see the stark differences between different designs.  In the current options pages, everything is so soft, both in line and color, as well as being so small, that it's hard to tell what you're looking at.

But the truly big disappointment is PowerPoint.  Their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill--I would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in 2007.  

I have reinstalled my 2002 programs.  I feel like I just wasted all the money I spent on this suite.  My suggestion?  If you absolutely have to have a PC because you do a lot of word processing, stick with Word 2002 or 2003.  If you need to do presentations/brochures/etc. for your business, get a Mac and avoid this problem altogether
