This is the worst thing since the Office Assistant animated paper clip.  Forcing the "ribbon" on the user assumes that the user likes icons (I don't -- what's wrong with words??), and fills too much of the screen real estate.  Nothing is where it should be.  And what arrogance on the part of Microsoft to provide no alternate views, no "classic" view, just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons.  Another oppressive, giant waste of my time and money at the hands of Microsoft.
