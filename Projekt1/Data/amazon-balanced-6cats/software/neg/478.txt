I work at Best Buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time.  For one its a huge system hog and two it doesn't catch much of the pesky spyware.  Also when computers come in to be cleaned up, no one uses this program (even though we're "supposed" to recommend it).  I would recommend xoft, pest patrol, or MS Antispyware much much more.
