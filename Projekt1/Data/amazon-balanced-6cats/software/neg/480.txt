I have owned Spysweeper for several years. I have found that a large amount of spyware is not getting caught.  In many cases, a  **portion** of the spyware was caught, Spy Sweeper did not remove the complete spywhere and I kept getting hits.  Tried out XoftSpy software and it found and removed ALL of the spyware.

Even more, I get constant e-mails from Webroot telling me that my "Subscription needs to be renewed."  and that I must send in another $25 to renew.  I got caught in their scam once until I started checking my subsciption date.  They frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions are up even though they may have as much as a year left.  I have contacted them several times on this issue with no response or correction.

I am only keeping this software installed because I paid out the bucks for it.  I would not recommend it to others mainly because of the decptive business practices and the inability to perform as advertized.  Look elswhere
