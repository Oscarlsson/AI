This is a good product but...

Unfortunately webrrot feels no need to stand by its current marketing claims of:

Free Software Updates
Spy Sweeper is continuously updated to provide you with the most advanced and effective spyware protection. As a Spy Sweeper customer, you receive these updates to our software absolutely FREE. 

This is simply not the case they have now instituted an anual subscription update fee like the big boys. When I addressed this with them on the phone they suggested I take it up with the vendor "Fry's Electronics" they should have warned you.

Our issues are concern over the future marketing claims made by this manufacturer. They will also say you should have read the small print... We guess their interpritation of free and the rest of the world's is a little different. Who knows what they will decide in the future.

We are seriously disappointed in webroot
