I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review,   I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC.   Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice.   Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer.   I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it.   I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product.    I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems.  I transfered it from an older abandoned PC.

I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software.   This is one of the few programs I could not instal.   I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems.
