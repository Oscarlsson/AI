Don't buy Zone Alarm if you use AOL; they are not compatable.  The pop-ups will drive you crazy and AOL won't work properly.  Also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed.  I bought it from Amazon and had to throw it away in a month...  no refund; money lost.  Norton is far better with AOL
