It seems that all previous Quickbook versions will not run on Windows Vista and I had upgraded my system. So, I bought Simple Start as the least expensive way to get a Quickbook product to run on Vista. Turns out Simple start runs fine on Vista BUT you cannot load a company file from earlier versions. Thus, Simple Start was simply useless to me. When I called Intuit customer service they said that for another $100 they'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature. By that time I was committed and had no choice. Talk about getting ripped off!!
