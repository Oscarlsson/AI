I read the review saying Simple Start didn't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version. Despite the warning, I thought I could get away with Simple Start because I was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program. Even for my simple needs, it was a bust I had to upgrade to Pro for an additional $100. If Quicken isn't enough for your needs, get Pro.
