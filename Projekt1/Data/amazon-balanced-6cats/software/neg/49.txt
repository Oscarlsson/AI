This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.
