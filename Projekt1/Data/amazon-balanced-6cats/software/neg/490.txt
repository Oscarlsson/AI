If you are buying this product because it is the cheapest one Intuit offers, excpect to get what you pay for.  If your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet, or downloading the free version from Microsoft, or even using their home version with business added.  By the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it.

Bottom line, if you want a good Quickbooks bump up to the Pro version, so you can get real Customer and Vendor management, and a decent overview summary, and multiple category levels
