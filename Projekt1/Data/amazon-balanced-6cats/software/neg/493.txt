I have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys. They won't talk to you on the phone, don't let you get support until you register your product with a serial #, which, if you lose and need to re-install, you can't get without a login and a serial #. That makes no sense.

I've had technical problems with True Image Home 9 and 10, and just can't get them to resolve it. Very unhappy with these guys. The product looks good, but if you have a glitch, prepare to wait A WEEK OR MORE for tech support to respond by email. Check out their web site and try some numbers - you'll find there's no way to talk to ANYONE unless you want to buy something.

This is not one experience with them. It's Feb 07 now, and this charade began last August! Buyer beware
