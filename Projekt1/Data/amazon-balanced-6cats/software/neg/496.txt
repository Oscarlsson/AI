It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac. I have used Window's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I cannot figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently. It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago. If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it...the docs will never transfer formatting properly. I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version. Having said that, there is no alternative to MS office; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power...no support and an inferior product for Mac user
