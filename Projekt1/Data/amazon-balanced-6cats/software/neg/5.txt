I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start
