I bought two of the Mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed. class. I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother (caregiver) passed away. The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother. Then she gets MUGGED by a rat! I feel this is a little to noir for small children. The math game (which I am returning unopened) is about her house burning down, and if she could prevent it by going back through time. I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects. I am returning both games
