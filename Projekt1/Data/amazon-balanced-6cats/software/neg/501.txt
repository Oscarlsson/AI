The creators of Mia's Reading Adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children's games. There is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child's effort. If you're looking to teach your pre-k/k child reading skills I'd recommend the Blue's Clues games instead. Any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did.
