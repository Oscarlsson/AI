I've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in Corel Draw, the file was saved several times without error, the finished piece is 2.6 GB. I exported it as a PDF that is 4.5 GB. Never any errors in Corel Draw. 

Acrobat won't open the PDF. Says it's corrupted.

Now when I open the CDR all I get is a single page, and when I right click on the file and look at the properties it says it's 0 pages.

I'm really upset, and now I've wasted an entire day with COREL's software, if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures COREL should WARN people on the package.

It looks like I'm SOL and I'm guessing Corel will never bother with a reply.

Hint: I think I'll switch to Adobe.

Sincerely,

Waitman Gobbl
