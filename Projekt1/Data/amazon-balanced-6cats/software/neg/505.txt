I purchased this item for $10 from Comp USA.  There was a problem with some of the files so when I finished installing it, my computer was a mess.
I lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else.  It took me a while to get the program removed and I eventually ended up doing a system restore.  When the screensaver came up it did look awesome.  I wish I could have used it but I am not going to try and install it again.
