In wandering around the web, I find I am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing (from Photoshop Elements 5).  When importing, Lightroom "thinks" for a long time (that's fine, and they do warn you it can be slow), but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import.
About the rest of the program?  I don't know.  Too frustrated just trying to get it up and running.
