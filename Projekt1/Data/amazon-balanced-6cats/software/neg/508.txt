I am rating this program just one star because I found out AFTER ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders.  I did go to the nuance website before ordering.  They didn't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard.  Anyway, if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing, you need the Preferred version, not this one.
