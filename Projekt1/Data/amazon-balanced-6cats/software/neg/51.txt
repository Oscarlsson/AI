I bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use. I am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy! It was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you're a professional architect/ computer genius
