I have a 3.2 ghz, 2 GB, PC, clearly ready for Vista.  After running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict (even the optional conflicts the second time around), they told me it would install, yet, it didn't.  After an hour of installing, it tells me the installation fails and restores XP.  I realise that mine is an isolated case, but it's typical Microsoft.  If you want something that works, buy a Mac
