In the instruction pamphlet under Scan Tools, there is a list of what the program scans.

One of the functions is a Registry Scanner--"This is a fast scanner that analyzes the Windows Registry for traces of known malware."

The bottom line--I have an infected registry which was discovered by my antivirus program and the Spyware Doctor doesn't know it's there. I do keep Spyware Doctor up to date.

I'm still looking for an effective spyware application
