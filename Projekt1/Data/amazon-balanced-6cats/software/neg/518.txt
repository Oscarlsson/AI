I have been a fan of spyware doctore for some time. Spyware doctor 4.0 was an excellent product. It did it job pretty good without taking up any significant resource. But unfortunately it seems that PCTOOLS have not yet got their act together for Version 5.0. The first version I received as an upgrade was version 5.0 build 172. Problems started as soon as my machine rebooted. The Spyware doctor service for apparently no reasons hogged the system resource to an extent 95-97%. Killing that does not matter because the application restarts after 15 sec, and also that it seems to be the heart of the application. After reboot the update started running and BAM came the blue screen of death. So after a series of reboots and crashes I installed the version 5 build 176. But that too did not work, hence finally I reverted back to version 4.0 and eveythig works perfectly.Please stay away from Version 5.0 till PCTOOLS get their act together. As a reference do go through the review of CNET for this product
