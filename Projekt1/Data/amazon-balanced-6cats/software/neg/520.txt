The new product release is worthless - too buggy and slow to work.  The previous releases were ok - they did find some malware and removed it, without interference in our system.  However, despite the cute-sy interface, there are other software programs that provide the same (or better) anti-malware support.

Most importantly, this company has some shady business practices (like hidden yearly automatic renewal charges, installing google toolbar with download, etc) and no way to contact them directly other than their online contact form which never receives a response.  Check out the Better Business Bureau to see their "unsatisfactory" report.

I am currently disputing a charge from this company on my debit card and have had huge problems - so far I have only been able to speak with Bridget at their third-party billing company who says they are not able to provide assistance with my complaint.  There are other, more reputable companies to work with.  This type of software is not worth the hassle
