This is an example of a large company pertpetrating fraud on the people who buy its products. 
I bought my son an iPod for Christmas. Unfortunately he could not use it to download from itunes on his 4 yr old Mac Powerbook computer. He needed to buy the newer (tiger) operating system. So another [...] to buy this operating system. He has been unable to install it on his Powerbook.Both of us have spent over 4 hours on the phone with Mac tech support(hah!) and have found no solution.  Finally they told us to bring it in to an Applestore (three hour drive away) which we did, only to be told that it would cost [...] for them to even  look at it.
I hope no one else has to suffer like we have just because you bought an iPod
