I loved the 2006 version of this software, but when I received an email offering an "upgrade" to the 2007 version, I decided to improve what I had.  I could not be more disappointed.  The resulting product is a miserable failure and I'm amazed that some people are having good luck with it.

This version prints everything off center.  I can play with some of it to center it, but not the Hallmark logo, etc., on the back.  The result is a very unprofessional mess.  I went online to report the problem saw they have a FAQ on the issue promising that "soon" they will have a "fix" I can download.  Three months later and still no "fix".

I've written Nova 3 times, they acknowledge the problem and issue the same automated response "Keep checking for updates".  Finally, after numerous emails and phone conversations they have agreed to let me return the software to them.

When I received the 2007 edition, which in every other way was virtually identical to the 2006 version, I threw away my old software.  I'm now thinking of purchasing it again because I found this software easy to use and loved to be able to make so many changes, add photos, etc.

Maybe some of these don't have this technical problem, but just be warned
