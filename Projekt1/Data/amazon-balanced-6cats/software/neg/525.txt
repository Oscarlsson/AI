I contacted the program's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what I did. I received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of January. Mid-February I asked again about it as there had been no fix. That time they said it would be fixed by the end of February. I've used their previous programs w/out problems, just wanted more variety so added this one. Apparently not a good idea.....
