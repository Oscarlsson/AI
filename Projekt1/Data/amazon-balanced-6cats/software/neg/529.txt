This is the worst software I bought. 

First,it cost $100 and McAfee did not honor the $55 rebate because I sent the rebate form a little late. They had only 15 days to send out after purchase while compusa receipt has much longer deadline to send our rebate form. Isn't that kind of trick? 

Second and most important, it slowed down everything, not a bit but by dozens of seconds  or even more than 1 minute. 

Third,the speed is not only the problem, its wireless connection sucks to the maximum and a couple of my machines can't get online and can't connect to the network. I have 3 PCs and 1 laptop. Only two machine can get connected. It also conflicts with Belkin network card driver which has been so popular for so many years. How the hell McAfee did not know that adaptor?

Fourth, there is no manual whattsover and you have to all figure that out yourself. Given it has so much problem it's very frustrating to configure it. Sometimes the security center is downloading forever. Who the hell knows what it is doing. Sucks. 

I had spent so much time to fine tune it and it still sucks that much. I changed back to Internet Security Suite which is much better than this. Don't buy it even they give it to you free or you will break the disk.
