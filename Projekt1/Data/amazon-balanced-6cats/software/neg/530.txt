 This software will not load properly no matter how you try. The online help is no help at all it gives you a few suggestions that all boil down to please try to re-install. Their down loadable wizard informed me after using it that I needed buy the components that didn't load but were on the disk. Try and remove the parts that do actually load and they do not uninstall properly. McAfee has a section devoted to removal of their software but so far all the suggestions have not worked. Need customer service and its $2.99 per minute from you're first call. I have never had such a horrid experience with a software from a "reputable" company in a long time. I will never buy McAfee products again.
