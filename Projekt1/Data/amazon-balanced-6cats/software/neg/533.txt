I bought this product because it combined a number of security elements.  It worked fine until I installed the network security feature.  We have a home network and as soon as I installed the product, the other computers were unable to access the internet.  When I tried to uninstall it, my computer lost internet access.  Even using the 26 digit key did not allow access.  Customer service was useless.  They gave me directions which involved changing the registry. Bad move.  Needless to say, I had to have a computer repair service fix the network, and I had to reformat my hard drive. McAfee assumed no responsibility for the problems it caused,  Dell was nice enought to walk me through the reformat and it wasnt even their product that caused the problems.  I would like to give this no stars
