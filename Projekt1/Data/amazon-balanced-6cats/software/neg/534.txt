I bought this to upgrade my previous version of McAfee Total Protection. The first install was on a laptop, when it configured the wireless security it actually made changes to my WAP setup without notifying me. First of all it said that I didn't have any security set up on the wireless connection (although I have it set up with disabled SSID, MAC filtering, WPA protection...), and after it was done it had changed the setup to WEP... Also causing my other wireless PCs (that don't have McAfee) and my Xbox 360 to no longer connect to the network... So I ended up deinstalling that part. 
Second PC: regular desktop, after installing the software (only select pieces: antivirus, firewall, spamkiller, privacy service) my multimedia sharing to the Xbox 360 no longer worked. Contacting McAfee support never yielded any usable response ('reinstall' seems to be the default answer ...). Deinstalling/reinstalling didn't help, opening up the firewall didn't help, etc. etc. so I ended up reverting back to my old version of McAfee.
I consider myself a power PC user, I've set up and configured dozens of PCs over the years, built my own PC, and I can honestly say that I have never used software worse than this one. I hardly ever write reviews, but I had to write this one. Be warned! Maybe McAfee will eventually get its act together, but for me it's time to move on.
One last comment: this McAfee software (just like prior versions btw) takes up a lot of resources - several services need to run that take up a considerable amount of memory). Not good if you don't have ample memory
