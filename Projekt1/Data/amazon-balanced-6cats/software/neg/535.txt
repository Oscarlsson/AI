Until '07, if you had a McAfee suite but only wanted to use some of its components, and use other programs for other aspects of protection, that worked fine. For instance, I use Zone Alarm Pro for firewall and Spyware Doctor for spyware, and McAfee '06 just for virus. This combination has worked fine, but McAfee '07 won't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed. And that's a no-go for me, since some components of McAfee (esp spyware) weren't rated all that well by reviewers.
