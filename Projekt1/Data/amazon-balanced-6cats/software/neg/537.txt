This has caused serious technical errors on my systems--all new laptops, desktops.  It will cause MS Word 2007 to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system, possibly requiring you to re-install your Vista OS.

Worked well in Windows XP and Office 2003 environment, and they claim this is Vista compatible, along with Paperport 11.  

The company will not offer me a refund.  I will pursue.
