Freezes IE 7 and you have to close out and restart...besides that, the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the "Print as Image" selection for anything that is scanned.  Overall it is OK, and with the vast price difference with Adobe, I can live with it.  BUT, make no mistake, this program is far inferior to the Adobe product
