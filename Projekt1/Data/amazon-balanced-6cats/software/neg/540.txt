I recently upgraded to MS VISTA and MS Office 2007 and I upgraded to the VISTA version of PDF Converter Pro 4.  BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!  The program installed some sort of pdf "add-in" to MS Office that caused Excel, Word, and Outlook to CRASH.  As soon as you opened one of the programs it would give an error message and close.  It took hours on the phone with Microsoft to figure out and correct the problem (THANKS MICROSOFT!).  However, I got ZERO help from Nuance, they wanted to charge me to even REPORT a problem!  BEAWARE YOU WILL NOT GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH NUANCE PRODUCTS! Before I upgraded, I used PDF Converter Pro at home whereas at work I used Adobe Pro.  There is no comparison, PDF Converter Pro while considerably cheaper, does not do near as good a job of producing pdf files. I'm still looking for something that works but is cheaper than Adobe.
