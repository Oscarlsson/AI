I have purchased this product which I run on a Dual Core Processor under Windows XP Professional. Software is very unstable and crashes many times when I want to open a document from a URL. ScanSoft solution is that one should save the document in once PC and then open it up. This is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a Band-Aid fix.
Customer Service is the worst I have ever experienced and NUANCE/Scansoft need to greatly improve this. I have submitted on various occasions emails which I never ever receive a response. When talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have NEVER EVER done so!!!! Extremely unreliable service. I own many of their products and will NEVER EVER purchase another one of their products.
