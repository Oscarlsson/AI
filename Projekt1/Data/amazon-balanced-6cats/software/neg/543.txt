I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software.

The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons.

I was hoping the "student & teacher" edition would be more instructive, but it's not.

I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach
