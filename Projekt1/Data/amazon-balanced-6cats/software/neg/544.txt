I used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday. 
First of all the software takes up a HUGE amount of space! Like 1600MB. The program is so slow and I have a relatively new computer. After about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes. I had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone. All the work gone. The text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces. Sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer. Once it added bright green lines where I had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background. I had to redo it. Piece of JUNK! but what does print on a color laser - don't try it with inkjet - looks great
