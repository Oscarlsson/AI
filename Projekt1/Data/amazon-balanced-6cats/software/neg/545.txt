Be careful with this program.  My wife bought it, and I tried to install it for her on our PC.  I made several attempts, and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure.  When installation hung, I could not cancel or kill it, or even shut down the PC without pressing the Reset button (on Windows XP Pro).

I went to the support page of the web site, and found a FAQ item about incompatibility with Zone Alarm.  If you're not familiar with Zone Alarm, it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users.  According to Nova Development, the only way to get Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove Zone Alarm.  Besides being a serious security risk, this is an extreme measure to have to take.  This seems to be perfectly OK with Nova Development.  They offer no workaround other than removing Zone Alarm from the PC.  Personally, this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if I did not use Zone Alarm.  You have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it.
