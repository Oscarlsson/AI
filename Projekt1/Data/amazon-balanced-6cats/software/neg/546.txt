This software was rated the best out of a large group of digital scrapbook programs. I am very disappointed with it. First of all, my system resources can't handle moving the pictures so while I click and drag, the screen doesn't keep up and I have no idea where the picture or item will end up. It's not very precise this way. The website's solution is to use my arrow keys. Ok, so maybe that's a problem with my computer. Second, I can't select photos easily because it brings up images that are too small to see the detail. And that's with the LARGE thumbnails. So in a photo of a group of 12 kids, I have to have the photo pre-selected. Not how I planned on putting together a scrapbook when I have thousands of photos to look through. Also, in researching the screen freeze issue I discovered that I can only have up to 10 pages in a scrapbook. Also not my part of my original plan. My advice would be to go to the designers website and look at the FAQ's before buying. It helps you to see any issues before you buy. I'm not sure what my next selection will be, but I don't see me using this for my scrapbooks.
