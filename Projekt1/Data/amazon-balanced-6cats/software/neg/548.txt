I bought Taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership. For the money I guess I'm satisfied with the partnership results, but that's where it ends.

Taxcut for Federal taxes is not integrated with Taxcut for business... ok so what do you want for cheap. But, it also isn't well integrated with the Massachusetts state tax version, leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls "special" situations (unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks, for example). Overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if I override calculated data I can not e-file (not that I would trust it to e-file my taxes). Form navigation is hopeless. I can only imagine what someone who isn't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess.

I filed for an extension; now I'm probably going to buy Turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns.

With a deep discount, I would probably purchase Taxcut again for the partnership taxes, because it is slightly easier to use than the Excel spreadsheets I'd been using (but only because I don't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms).

Honestly, you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional Taxcut without the overblown, fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads Turbotax alternative
