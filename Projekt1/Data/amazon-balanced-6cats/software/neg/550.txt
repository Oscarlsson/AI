This program sucks. I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing (i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs, there's very little transparency in the system). Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax, and I needed to get my taxes done quickly. This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites. I will NOT be buying this product again
