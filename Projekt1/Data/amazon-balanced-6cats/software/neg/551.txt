It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone. There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it. 
I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware. I was happy with taxcut until this year. It is defective. I can't even believe it isn't in the news. My taxcut program is missing the "wages" entry on the Schedule C form. It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it. I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available. I can't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I couldn't find any reference to this problem anywhere. Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it didn't make any other mistakes! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand.
