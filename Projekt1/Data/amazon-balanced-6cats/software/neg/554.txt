This is a complete joke.  The only cities that are in the program for U.S. states are major metro areas. If you have a handheld (either regular or mobile phone) you more than likely also have WiFi or GPRS internet connection.  And if you are in a major metro area, with a WiFi connection, why would you need a program for maps?  Just go to Yahoo Maps or Mapquest.  If you don't have a WiFi, then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing (maybe even more!) than this program.

The only possible way this program could be useful is if you already have a handheld GPS receiver AND you never find yourself outside major metropolitan cities.  I have a GPS receiver for my laptop (USB) which I though could connect to my handheld and it won't...so my advice is to buy an entire package (software and handheld-specific GPS receiver).

Can't believe Microsoft put its name on this junk
