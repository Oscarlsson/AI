I purchased this program recently, and was very disappointed.  The maps are very limited...for example, most of the major tourist areas (beaches, Newport, ect.) in Rhode Island are cut out of the RI map.  I recommend buying MS Streets and Trips 2005 (which includes Pocket Streets 2005 in the box) instead:

With this program, you have the entire USA at your disposal, and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone.

Fortunatly, the store that sold me Pocket Streets allowed me to exchange it for Streets and Trips (after paying the difference).  The prices are very close.
