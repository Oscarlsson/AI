This app is just horrendous. It is literally NOTHING more than a moving map; I'm serious. There are NO features at all. To make things worse, when zoomed out, the display is littered with the names of every little village and hamlet you've never heard of, leaving the names of recognizable towns a cities nowhere to be found. Also, at these zoom levels, most roads, streets and highways are not visible, making navigation impossible. This app does not even come close to qualifying as a GPS nav system. Even as a 'moving map' it's pretty well useless unless you're zoomed into about 300 yards. Even though this app was a freebie included with Trips and Streets 2005 (which is a VERY nice, capable app.), it's still maddening that Microsoft would allow such a eggregiously lame program to be released. If it were possible to give this program negative stars AND charge Microsoft with a crime, I'd do it in a heartbeat
