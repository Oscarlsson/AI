This is simply awful!  I would expect this type of performance from some no-name brand software purchased at a flea market - not from Microsoft!  I think they must of contracted this off to some really low bidder.  I had more satisfaction tossing the software into the trash than trying to auction it off on some internet site.    I think I'll go with the TomTom Navigator software instead
