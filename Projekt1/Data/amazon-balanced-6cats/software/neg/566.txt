This is an extremely flawed software program. I have used Quicken for more than a decade, and this product is not worthy of the name. Runtime errors keep me from evening getting the program going. It contains 6 bank accounts which I cannot currently print checks from. I have reinstalled the software at least 15 times with no success. I have used every suggestion from tech support and the Quicken forums without ANY success. I guess I'll have to move to MS Money
