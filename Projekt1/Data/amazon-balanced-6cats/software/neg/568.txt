Looks nice... but beware!

Installed Norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office.  As soon as I did that our accounting system (Peachtree) started to lock up a few times a day.  Even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up.

I've now uninstalled Norton 360 on the server PC and that seems to have solved the problem.

I wish now that I had just upgraded from Norton Internet Security 2005 to 2007...  Never again.
