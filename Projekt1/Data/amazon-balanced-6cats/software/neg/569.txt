Installed great - looked good. Day 3 it started blocking me from websites 'as their security certificate had been revoked' - Amazon even? After a week of back and forth 'support' they couldn't fix it and left me with a partially working PC to drown.  THe PC support is partially automated as they didn't read my responses and their advice went in circles.  Plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare.

It might work on XP but don't get it if you have Vista.
