Having had Norton products installed for years including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and SystemWorks, I decided to replace the installed products with Norton 360 and a non-Norton password manager.  Obviously, it is critical to FIRST remove all Norton programs before installing Norton 360.  The installation process proceeded relatively smoothly.

My computing environment includes a 1.6Ghz processor, 1,000MB of memory, and 6GB of available disk.  

The background scans and LiveUpdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire CPU at 100% CPU utilization.  One application that streams radio broadcasts now stops.  I immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups, however, the CPU occasionally still locks.  

Additionally, there is no way to transfer security settings from previous Norton products to Norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive.

If you now have separate Norton security products and are satisfied with them, save your money and renew the Norton subscriptions.
