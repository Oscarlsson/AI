My subscription for 2006 was up and I needed to renew - since I just reinstalled Windows XP Professional (SP2) on my laptop (a Dell Inspiron 9300, Intel Pentium M 2GHz, 512MB RAM, 60GB Hard Disk), I decided to simply purchase the 360.

I have been having issues with the Live Update for several weeks now (Error 5).  Instead I have to download a 15 MB file ever so often with the updated definitions.

After checking the technical support website, it appears that Norton is aware of the problem and is currently working on it.  That was just about two weeks ago.  Customer support is non-existent it appears since I have yet to be contacted.

Complete waste of time.  Renew your existing subscriptions instead.  I wish that I had
