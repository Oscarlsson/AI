The video editing part of this software is completely useless.  It didn't come with a manual and I ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it.  It hasn't made a difference.  The software is completely uncooperative.  My computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program.  If you bought this software for the video editing, I recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else
