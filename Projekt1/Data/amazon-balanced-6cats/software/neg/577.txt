That's exactly where my CD went. In the garbage. That's where all the other Roxio software I've ever owned has ended up. At least I never had to spend extra for their junk.

It's always came as  part of a peripheral or PC software package. 

No printed manuals are ever provided and it's always an issue trying to download one from the Roxio website...which I would then have to print at my expense.

I could live with the on-screen manual if the software wasn't buggy and they provided some sort of customer support. 

I can't believe that this company is still in business. I guess that they survive by making deals with peripheral and PC manufacturers to stick their customers with inferior software.

Be advised......don't be fooled by their slick packaging and website. Read the reviews here and elsewhere
