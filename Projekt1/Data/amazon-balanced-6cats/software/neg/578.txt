The video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out. The tools are not explained and there isn't as much to do with it as they imply. May be nice for birthday party editing, i don't know. I didn't like it. It's not worth $100. The other capabilities might be nice,but from what i've dealt with, that's not the case
