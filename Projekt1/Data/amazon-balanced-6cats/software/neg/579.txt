I was extremely disappointed in this "upgrade".  I had Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 and loved it.  That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort.  Almost everything was intuitive.

Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility.  So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what?  The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts.  Arranging music is not as easy as it was before.  And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother.

In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing!

Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works.  I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money).  I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio
