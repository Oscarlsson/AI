Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD.  Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9.  This sucks.  I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9.  Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time.  Even in the new 7.5 version.  Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen
