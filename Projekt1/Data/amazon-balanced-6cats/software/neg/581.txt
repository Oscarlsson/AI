I foolishly purchased 7.0.  It worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system.  Funny, it started hanging up when 7.5 was released.  I tried to get "customer support" but that's a joke.  Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ROXIO.  I'd given this software negative stars if I could.  Spend your money elsewhere.
