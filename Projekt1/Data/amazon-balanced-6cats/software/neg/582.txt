The game disk does not run on my laptop. But it will play it on my desktop computer.  Very annoying, but at least I can play (other reviewers have not been so lucky).

The game has some good questions and I enjoy testing my Friends knowledge.  The game itself is rather simple and not totally fun.  The "game board" is the outside of the Friends' apartment building.  When you get a question right a window lights up.  When you get one wrong a window dims.  If you don't answer the question nothing happens.  You win when all the windows on that floor are lit up.  I would prefer that they make you answer all questions- none of this passing on a question- it would up the ante and perhaps add some excitement.

If you play a multi-player game you cannot select which letter is your buzzer and the letters assigned by the game designers are adjacent keys on the keyboard!  It's silly for the two players to be huddled together, hovering over the same part of the keyboard when the designers could have selected other letter keys set further apart.

There are SOME video clips and still images accompanying the questions, but it's mostly a trivia game without visual aids or embellishments.  Think Trivial Pursuit with a computer screen as the cards.

This game was a gift.  If I had to do it over again I'd probably spend my money instead on Scene It! Friends Edition.  As of right now, Scene It! Friends Edition is on sale at Circuit City for the same price as this game is on Amazon. (And though I haven't played it, the reviews of that game are much better than this one).
