This is an item that I purchased from Amazon.com that I am not satisfied with.  I cannot install the game on my computer to play it.  I had a relative try to install it on her computer and she also could not install it to play.  She believes that it could be a damaged disk, and that I should pursue getting a refund or replacing it with another copy.  I hope you can help me with this.  Thank you for your support.
