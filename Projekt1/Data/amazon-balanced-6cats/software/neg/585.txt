     I read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk. I thought this couldn't possibly happen on my high tech computer... I WAS WRONG... Even though I purchased a legitamate copy, the program still would not let me run it.... BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
