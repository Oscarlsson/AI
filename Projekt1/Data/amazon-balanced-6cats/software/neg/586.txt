I changed from quicken to Quickbooks and regret it.  Yes, Quick Books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but I have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards.  I have also found it difficut to match transactions.   To get a better handle on my expenses I am going back to quicken or try another program.   Online help and tutorials, "dummies guide.... not helpful either.

You would think see they make quicken they would allow import of QIF files.
dissapointed.
