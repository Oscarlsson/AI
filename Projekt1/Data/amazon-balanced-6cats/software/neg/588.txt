The product is great, calling tech support is a task though. Intuit outsources thier call centers overseas and it is difficult to communicate with thier support people by telephone. If this product wasn't preffered by my CPA I would never buy it ever again. Boycott companies that outsource to other countries, keep our jobs at home!
