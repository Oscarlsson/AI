I'd give this product zero stars if I could.  

I use the QuickBooks online payment service with version 2004, and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service, so they forced me to upgrade.

So I bought the upgrade, and when I ran the installer it wouldn't accept my serial number.  I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work.  I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer.

I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.  I'd used QB since the early-1990s and never really had a problem.  But this is really, really bad.

Intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version.  It's a TOTAL LEMON
