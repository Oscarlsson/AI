I have been using Paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about 9/10 years and since then upgraded a few versions. After reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from Nuance website, I cannot justify upgrading my paperport software to PRO given its  current cost. I am pretty sure that a lot more people (especially loyal users like me) would snap it up if it was little cheaper. I will probably wait for some time for price to go down.... It will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet !!!) and become compatible with Vista. For those of you who got lotsa money (please send me some), I would recommend Paperport as a decent doc managment s/w
