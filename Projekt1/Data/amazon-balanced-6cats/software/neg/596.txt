I have been a user of PaperPort since version 9, skipped the upgrade to 10 because of bad reviews, received an upgrade notice in the mail, so I decided to buy it. It turns out it was a bad decision. The scanner that I use with 11 is the same as with 9 and is on Nuance's hardware compatibility list. The problem is, it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with PaperPort. Then, when I did get it installed - and I used the advanced setup option with it, tested it, all looked good - except everytime I scan something, the program crashes! It is literally unusable as a scanning solution.

I have seen a few companies with products that were once really good, sell it off to another company, and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned. It seems that this may be the case. There are no updates or bug fixes for 11, and I will not buy another PaperPort version in the future. I will attempt to go back to 9, and probably stay with that. If I run into any issues with it over time, I will look elsewhere, and I recommend others do the same. I normally don't write reviews for products, but this one is so poor, I just had to warn people
