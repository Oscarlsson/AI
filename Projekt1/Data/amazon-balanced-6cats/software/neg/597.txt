  I've used PaperPort for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options. However, Version 11 is buggier than earlier versions: every time I launch a Microsoft Office product, the PaperPort installer starts up.

  There is no reference to this in the PaperPort Help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the PaperPort site. Another bug imprints a "trial copy" legend on your PDF files. This one is explained in the knowledgebase, but requires you to tinker with the Registry to correct it. That's a bit ridiculous. Why are they distributing code with a known bug?

  Nuance expects you to pay $9.95 for e-mail technical support - even if it's a bug in their own product.

  The product is a modest performer at best, but Nuance's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here.

  I've requested an RMA for a refund.
