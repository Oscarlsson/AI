I used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it.  Boy are they right.  This thing is terrible.

After installing on Windows XP SP2, as soon as I started the program it crashed.  Now every time I try to scan using my Canon Scanner, it crashes every time.

Product is useless.  Wish I had of never bought it!

DO NOT BUY!
