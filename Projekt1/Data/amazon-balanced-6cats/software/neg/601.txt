I bought it, installed it, tried it, uninstalled it and returned it (of course I had to reformat my computer to get things back to the way I like them). Reviews say it was a big improvement.  Maybe so, but I have no desire to learn a whole new way of doing things again. I spent years learning keyboard short cuts and putting up with a product I thought was inferior to WordPerfect (how I would love to have the reveal codes option for formatting).

Be prepared for a steep learning curve. If you use word a lot and are proficient, you will find it very frustrating. Menus are different, key combinations are not all the same. You can customize it, but to be honest, I don't care. 

Between Vista and Office 2007, I think Microsoft has finally screwed the pooch. I'll stick with the old versions (XP and Office 2003) for now. My next computer will be a Mac running OS X and some sort of open office application. I have had enough.
