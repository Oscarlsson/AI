As another reviewer says:

"But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all."

Exactly. I've re-installed it over and over and the same thing happens. I've used Turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this. After spending hours entering in my data, there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage. With four days before the due date, this is disasterous. Their support site offers no hint of a fix. Mac users, stay away
