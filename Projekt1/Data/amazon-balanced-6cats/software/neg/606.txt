This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first
