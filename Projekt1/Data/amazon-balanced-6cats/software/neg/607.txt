The program does a great job in figuring my taxes. But now Intuit is charging for filing and the state program. Also I was unable to download the updates over my dial-up connection.  I called to have a CD version mailed to me but so far I haven't received it. I'm trying Tax Act this year. It is a free program and has free filing. IF I can complete the TurboTax version I will see if I can duplicate my return using Tax Act.  If so then good bye TurboTax
