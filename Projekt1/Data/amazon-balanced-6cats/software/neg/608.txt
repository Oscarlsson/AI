I have used Turbo Tax for about 20 years and have loved it.  In the past it was user-friendly, efficient and complete - it even printed out all the forms I needed - ready to send to the IRS.

As usual, I purchased it this year.  
The format changed and isn't nearly as user friendly as in years past.  You have to manually select the walk-through feature, section by section and it's very easy to miss sections.

When I got to the end, it wouldn't let me do a review for errors until I updated the version.  But, I don't have internet at home and couldn't update.  It crashed my computer 3 times before I skipped the review totally.  (God only knows what else I skipped in the process.)

When I went to print the forms - again it nagged me that the software was inferior and needed to be updated.  Again, I skipped it but the pages printed out with a nasty watermark saying the forms weren't updated and couldn't be used.  I can't use these.  I can't send them to the IRS.  So, I have to find IRS forms and manually insert the information myself.  So, why did I spend money for the software??

Why would they sell a product that you can't actually use?  Yes, it'll "prepare" my forms.  But, what good is that if I can't print them out?  

Why would they sell a product that was already so obsolete that you can't use it without contacting the company for another version?

ABSOLUTELY - RUN - DON'T WALK - RUN RUN RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  DON'T BUY IT because it simply doesn't work.

I won't use Turbo Tax again.  They have lost a faithful and long time customer
