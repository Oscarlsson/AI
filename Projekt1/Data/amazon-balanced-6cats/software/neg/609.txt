I kid you not, this suite,program,resource *THUG* IS THE WORST GARBAGE ON THE MARKET. Like others i read the shiny reviews and took a chance and purchasing it because of the frequent trips to HELL I had logged in with other so called "SECURITY SUITES" over the years. Works ok for about the first month or so and then...WHAMMMM..crash city. Think I'm joking...buy it and find out for yourself. I'm no PRO yet, but i do have enough knowledge about programming to know when my PC goes from( NORMAL to CHOKE) out of the clear blue. Uinstalled it (3X) just to make sure that it was the cause of the problem,sure enough,it was. Other reviewers mentioned thier processor being pulled to the grind...well it's true. STAY AWAY...STAY FAR..FAR..AWAY
