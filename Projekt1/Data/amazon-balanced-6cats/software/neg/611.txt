I've been a long time user of Trend Micro's PCcillin but after reading poor reviews on their latest version I decided I didn't want to take a chance on it so I went looking for different anti-virus software. I stumbled onto this ZoneAlarm (piece of junk) and after reading mostly wonderful reviews I down loaded their trial.  It didn't seem too bad. After a few weeks I bought this 3 computer suite and installed it. I went a while longer and notice my computer's performance was not as good as it was. I downloaded upgrades and uninstalled old versions and installed new.  Now after about a month my computer is practically unusable (as well as the kid's - they have been screaming about slow computer since the start).  
This zonealarm is the worst software I have ever used.  It hogs CPU and memory.  It gets the CPU usage to 80 - 100% and it doesn't free it up.  I shut down all programs and CPU just keeps churning away. The interesting thing is that at times I would check task manager processes and system idle would be 90% but when you check the performance tab the CPU chart would be near 100%?  Go figure! I finally said enough and uninstalled it (and deleted every occurrence of zonealarm out of the registry) and downloaded Trend Micro's pccillin.  It's installed and I got my old machine back.  Log-ins take 40 seconds were they would take over 3 minutes with ZA.  CPU is back to normal.  You couldn't give me this cr*ppy software.  I wish I would have stuck with pccillin and saved the $40
