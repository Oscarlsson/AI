I bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in CNet. However, I just bought a new Dell Inspiron E1505 that shipped with Windows Vista Home Premium, and ZoneAlarm 6.5 is flat out incompatible with the new OS. I downloaded ZoneAlarm 7.0 and that is flat out incompatible as well. I'm sure this is a great Security Suite for Windows XP, but beware if you have Vista. There seems to be no update on their website when Zonelabs will release a Vista compatible ZoneAlarm. (They mention something about "after January 2007", but it's March, for crying out loud!) So there's my purchase price of a good product down the drain
