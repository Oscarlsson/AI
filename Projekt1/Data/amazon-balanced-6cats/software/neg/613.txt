I purchased this product after reading many negative reviews on other products (my last Internet security product was PC-Cillin, I didn't renew because of the Low ratings for 2007). What I found was that an huge load was put on my processor, and system memory apparently because I use a program that feeds video over the internet from a network cam.  I never had problems like this before, and after some research on the ZA support site, I found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking.  VSMON.exe seems to be the culprit, and is the main component of the Zone Alarm product.  Everything seems fine, as long as I don't try to use video over the internet(including IM webcams).  I would recommend thinking about if you intend on using webserver programs before making this purchase
