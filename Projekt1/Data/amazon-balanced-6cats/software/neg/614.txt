I bought a new PC last week and maxed it out with a gig of ram and 512 video card...Vista was preinstalled...

These are the basic specs of the PC I have:

AThlon 64 X2 dual core processor
2 Gig memory DDR 2
250 SATA HDD

not only did this thing run slow...I found out that a lot of my old software wouldn't work...what gives????

I ran Company of Heroes (seemingly a surefire bet considering the upgrades) and that crawles like I was trying to run this on a minimum spec'ed machine...and mind u I bought this new AND did upgrades (an extra 250 dollars worth) so I wound up spending a nice part of Saturday reformatting the HDD and putting XP back on my machine and viola! I really get to see whta kind of power I am working with...

for those of you thinking about going back to XP, do it and wait until Vista gets figured out...it's 250 dollar resource hog and it won't be on my machine for a little while...and while u are at it...please be sure to back up your drivers files...
