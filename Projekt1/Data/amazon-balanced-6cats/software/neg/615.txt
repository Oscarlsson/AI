I bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer.  I tried to install and half way through the set up, after it had uninstalled my old programs, I got a message to abort.  The abort left me with a damaged media program, and thus far I have spent over $400 trying to re-connect damaged files and programs.  My best advice is to wait until Microsoft gets the "kinks" out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade
