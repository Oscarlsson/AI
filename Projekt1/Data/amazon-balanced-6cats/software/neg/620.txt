I have used McAfee for at least 5 years. This 2007 Suite is a piece of trash. I takes soooooo long to find a site that IF it eventually finds it you forget what you were looking for.  At half the sites, if they are found, it will not allow me to progress into the site. In setting it up it insisted upon registering but never did tell me if the registration was completed; just kept blinking. I assume it was registered because it did update. I cannot get into half the sites I visit on a regular basis. It won't even find the McAfee site. Just sits there searching until it gives me a notice it can't find the site. Never will I buy another piece of software from McAfee. I should have read the reviews before I bought it but I had been satisfed with the previous version so I never bothered reading them. Dumb move on my part. Dumb one on yours if you buy it. Never again.
