As everyone else has said, this product is not at all what it should be.

It slows down the internet browsing to a crawl (my laptop that has crashed several times, is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with McAfee).

You can't close it, as others have said, other than uninstalling.

The funniest part I've found, however, is that it warns you the first time it tries to access.  Being amused, I refused the program permission to update itself.  Other than removing the program, it was the best thing I did using McAfee
