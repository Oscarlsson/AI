Buyer beware: this program will critically impair your system!  Internet loading will be drastically crippled.  Expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes.  There is NO WAY to close McAfee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall.  I am going to return this first thing next week.  I gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades, but nothing has changed.  If only I had read the reviews ahead of time.  
Bottomline: if you don't mind these side-effects, by all means purchase this program;  McAfee has solid protection.  But there are easier ways to get that protection
