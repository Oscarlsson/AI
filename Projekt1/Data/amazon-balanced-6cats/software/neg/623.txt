I had McAfee ISS 2006 and loved it.  I bought 2007 when my subscription expired.  Oh my dear God!! What have I done!!  The thing is complete crap. My computer is 1 year old with duel core chip and 2GB of memory.  This thing never crashed.  I loaded 2007 and it was crashing every 5 minutes!!  I could not get on the internet with my browsers.  McAfee was updating and Microsoft was reporting the serious errors with no problem, but forget about trying to get help from their website.  They have got to be kidding!!  I tried to uninstall it, forget about it.  I was able to get enough of it off so that my computer is able to access the internet and not crash every 5 minutes.  Thanks alot McAfee, you took a good product and turned it into crap and made a mess of my computer.  I downloaded a free firewall and AVG anti virus.
