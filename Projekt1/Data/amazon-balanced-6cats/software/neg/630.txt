I agree with the other reviews this is a horrible piece of software. I am a software developer and have written some serious applications in my career, and this one ranks at the bottom of the barrel.

I have a stock Dell XP machine, and after a 15-minute install, Audition 2.0 crashes every time on startup. I never even got it to run. Tried calling Adobe support -- useless...waited 35 minutes on hold then hung up. Search of Google groups for answers revealed nothing, as did their support site.

I *loved* Cool Edit 2000, and even Audition 1.5 to some degree. This new version is what happens when too many engineers get put on a project. It's a remnant of a once great application. Avoid it like the plague
