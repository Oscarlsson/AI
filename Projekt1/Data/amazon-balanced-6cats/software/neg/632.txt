Adobe Audition is my favorite program. I use it more than any other program I have on my computer. I have used it to restore thousands of old phonograph discs. I am only giving them one star because I can't give them no stars for this joke.

I knew this was going to happen. I had been using Cool Edit Pro for a long time when Adobe bought it and I knew that they were going to turn it into an Adobe product and screw it all up. I am very fortunate that I went to Adobes web site and downloaded the free trail version. I would have been really upset if I had actually paid money for this dog.

Lets start with the boot up time. I own a 2 year old average laptop and Audition 1.5 used to boot in about 2 seconds. 2.0 takes 20 seconds. That is almost as long as Photoshop or Premiere Pro. 

Next we have the user interface. They destroyed it. And the old one worked so well. Adobe is really hung up about making absolutely everything a "Palette" and so now every little thing is a palette, allowing you to resize and relocate them to your hearts desire. But after about a half an hour of trying I'll be darned if I could not make the 2.0 interface remotely resemble the 1.5 interface. 

The shortcuts buttons have been removed (wow that makes a lot of sense), however you can get it back if you look long enough for the place to do it. (Don't bother to right-click anything, in their imperial wisdom right-clicking is now pretty useless.) But if you do put the shortcuts back up they are now all black and white and it is really difficult to find the one you want. In place of the shortcuts they added some icons that I have yet to figure out or to need. What are they thinking????

A lot of the presets have been reconfigured and trying to figure them out gave me a headache. 

After several hours of playing with this pile of garbage I decided to uninstall it and return to using 1.5.
