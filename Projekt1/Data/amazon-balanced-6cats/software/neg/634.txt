I am not a bookkeeper. Without bookkeeping software I would be lost! I own a small business and help keep books for a friend's business. I have Quickbooks from 1996 and love it so I convinced my friend to get this newer version. I am very disappointed with the format and see very little similarity between them. Aarrrgh!
