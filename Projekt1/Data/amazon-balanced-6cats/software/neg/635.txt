This program is terrible to deal with.  I run a small business and bought QuickBooks Simple Start.  Once loaded and you go to use the program there is a pop up requiring you have an Administrator.  When loading the software it does not tell you to select or bypass the Administrator requirement.  You only learn this when you first go to use the program. The URL they give on the pop up for troubleshooting does not address this issue, either.  You are just locked out of the program.  Now it gets fun. So, you have to speak to them for help.  But this is where it gets to be no laughing matter.  To get help you have to email them to ask for help.  They then call you back at their convenience.  If you are busy working when they call back you have to start all over.  I have yet to be able to use this product since I bought it 3 weeks ago because they will not call back when it is convenient for me the customer and will not let me call in at my covenience.  Even worse, since they have bought out all their competitors QuickBooks customer support no longer is available after regular hours when a small business owner has the time to handle such operations issues.  I can't return this product for a refund because I have loaded it.  My first clue to how not user friendly this product is should have been the title: Simple Start
