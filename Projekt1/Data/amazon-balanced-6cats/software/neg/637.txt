This is by far the most basic editing/creative package that I have ever used.  I have been using every version of Print Shop since some of their early versions.  I have Print Shop 22 and was haveing issues with printing in MS Vista.  I figured that I would be able to purchase one of Broderbund's similar products (one made for Vista) and it would be similar in style and usage.  Wrong.  I was not able to import other Print Shop projects, printing is limited, no drag and drop feature from other programs, limited editing, formating of text is off when copying from one document to another, sizing pictures and text boxes while editing projects is limited to dragging corners only, and on-and-on.  I tried to use Broderbund's tech support page, but it is very limited to their FAQ section.  Try asking a question or emailing for help; good luck.  I will fumble with this product for awhile (only because I can print more than one page at a time, because PS 22 in Vista only allows for this)and wait until the next compatible version of PS comes out for Windows Vista.  I would have thought there would of at least been a patch by now.  I think they may have made Zoom the way it is now to allow for newer, better versions.  I hope this helps...
