I was very disappointed in this software.  It's not really good for anything and I still haven't figure out why this was even released.  I own Printmaster 15, American Greetings Creata Card 8, and an few other photo and scrapbook programs.  This software has templates to make banners, cards, invitations, and all that stuff.  The templates are few compared to other programs and then to customize them, well you really can't.  If you try to start out with a blank template and add your own photos you are limited to what you can do.  No borders, edging, font manipulating.  It's just insert the photo, do some basic photo touch ups and that is pretty much it.  I wanted to add shadows, edges, frames to my pictures and couldn't.  The fonts could only be made in single color.  You could not add outlines or drop shadows, NOTHING.  Add the font, pick your size, pick your style, and that was it.  You can only save to their 1 file format which of course only works with zoom.  No e-mailing or file converting.  What good is this program I have yet to find out.  I spend time to make a birthday invitation from my own pictures.  Well guess what, I couldn't e-mail it to my guests.  Print is all it does.  Complete waste of money.  This is the first software I ever purchased that I will be returning.  Spend a few extra bucks and get something like Print Master, Print Shop, or something comparible
