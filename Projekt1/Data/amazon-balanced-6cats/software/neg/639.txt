I bought this product based on Consumer Reports review.  I've had Norton and McAfee in the past which slowed down my system.  My computer is slower to start up with ZoneAlarm, but faster than McAfee while on.  However, most of the time, I need to shut off ZoneAlarm in order to access the internet - just like another reviewer.  Defeats the purpose don't you think?  It also recognized my offices's software as a virus and although I allowed access, it keeps showing it as a virus.  I'm going to have to go to another product.
