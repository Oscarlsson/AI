It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K
