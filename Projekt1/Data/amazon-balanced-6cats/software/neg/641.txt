I am very disappointed in this program.  I have been doing my own graphics/cards for about 10 years.  I started with Print Shop (early edition) and progressed thru all the updates.  I then switched to PrintMaster and LOVED it!!!  Again, I have progressed to each new verion with very little or no problems...until now!  This has got to be the worst of the worst--- the program did not want to load without being babied.  When it finally loaded, it was very confusing and I found that I needed to get my graphics from the internet!  The area I live in only allows me to have dial up---you can imagine how long it takes to get the graphics I want!  If you are interested in doing your own graphics/cards, skip this program...go back to PrintMaster Platinum 16 for much better results.  As far as I am concerened, the River Deep Company needs to hide this edition in the DEEPEST RIVER they can find
