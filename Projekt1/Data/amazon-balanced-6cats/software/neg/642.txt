I've been using a Win 98 version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the XP version was tempting.
However, it does not work at all in my portuguese XP.
After searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer's database I was informed that it does not work in non-english Win XP.
All the previous versions worked fine in my PCs but this one was totally disappointing. Living in Brazil, I had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value I would recover.
Shame on them
