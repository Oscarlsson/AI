You've GOT to be kidding me.  The Fry's salesperson told me Microsoft Word couldn't print business cards and that I should buy this product to make high quality business cards.
What an incredible lie.
This is such a piece of junk.  It has almost nothing.  The cards look TERRIBLE, a total embarassment.  It's HARD TO USE, it's easier to make it in Word.
