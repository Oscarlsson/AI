I love PrintMaster.  I'm currently using PrintMaster 16 Platinum.  I have used many generations of this program with great success.  I have taught classes on creative desktop publishing and always recommended--even sold--PrintMaster, but this one is terrible!  Most of the images, even the previews, seem to be online and require a download which is very slow.  The thumbnails are low resolution and hard to see, so you have to download previews just to get a good look.  Most of the images can't be accessed at all, because there is a prompt for the intall/program disk.  There is no such disk.  There are separate install and program disks, neither of which satisfies the program.  
  Encore, which now distributes the program, does not support it.  Broderbund does not not support it, except through its website which does not address this issue.  If you try to phone customer service, you pay for a call to get an automated response which sends you to another response which tells you to go to the website.
