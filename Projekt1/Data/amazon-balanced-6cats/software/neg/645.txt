I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out.  I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less.  Where are all the projects?  Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone.  For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2!  The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background.  (At least you won't need much ink).  In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself.  Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send.
