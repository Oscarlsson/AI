I have used lots of PrintMaster versions I had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so I was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me I wouldn't have a problem with the new one.  This new version is JUNK; all the projects have to be downloaded so if you don't have a high speed connection forget it!  I don't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc.  I sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response.  So looks like I have to find new software
