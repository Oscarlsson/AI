Everyone uses office.  Everyone is familiar with office.  So why did MS change the interface to make it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get anything done?  I am computer savy (I'm an engineer) and I find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating.  Worst of all there is NO way to go back to the "old" drop down menu system.  It honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word/powerpoint because they've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons.  MS claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you're familiar with the ribbons.  I don't know/care whether that's true or not.  The learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new UI is immense.  So much so that the time investment to become proficient FAR FAR FAR out ways any "increase" in productivity....not to mention that it's overpriced.  Offce 2003 is a far superior product
