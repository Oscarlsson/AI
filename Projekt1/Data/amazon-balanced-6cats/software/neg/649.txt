I just wanted to write a little note about getting the case open.  I just received my copy today, and in my excitement discarded the darn instruction on how to open......I know you're all probably thinking I'm just stupid.....after realizing what I did - I'd have to agree!  :)

Anyway, if you pull off the "peel" tab and get rid of it - here's what you do:  

See that red tab at the top of the box/package?  Hold the case from the "spine" and pull the little red tab down.  I found it most effective if I used my thumb and index finger (I'm right handed) on the tab and placed my middle finger on the top of the spine, and pushed a little with my middle finger.  I've gotten so used to ink cartridges, and other items that have a "don't pull this yet" type of tab, I was a little afraid of touching it....until of course I finally found what I did with my "peel" notice and found I did need to pull on the little red tab.  

So that's all there is to it.  Again, most of you out there probably think I'm stupid - but for the one or two others out there that tossed that peel tab  - Enjoy.  I'm going to install tomorrow, and once I've used the programs I'll see about a real review then
