The product was fine, but, I received an older version and as a result I couldn't properly update it even after registering it.  As a result, I purchased the newest version available directly from Lavasoft and it works fine and I have had no trouble updating it.  Why didn't you specify what version it was on your website; then I could have made an informed decision?
