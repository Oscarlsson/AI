The software requires a "patch"...not a big deal.

Once I got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes.  The "goofiness" is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software.

It has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well.

If you are SERIOUS about trying to learn some basic conversational Spanish, try something else.  Don't waste your time or money on this one..
