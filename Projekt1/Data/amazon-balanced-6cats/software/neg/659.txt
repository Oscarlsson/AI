I bought PC-Cillin because it has 4 stars in Amazon rating, which is much better than McAfee and Norton. But I am wrong. Before installed PC-Cillin, everything is fine. But after installed, I can not access my yahoo email. After calling customer service two times, even uninstalled PC-Cillin, I still can not access yahoo email. Now I have to re-install Windows XP. It will cost me a lot of time. Anyone knows what wrong is
