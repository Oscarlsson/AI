If you have not bought this yet, don't. If you have, but haven't installed it yet, don't. 

I've used Quicken for years, and this is the worst implentation yet. The major problem, an issue known to the company, is that reports will not print properly on many printers. 

Wait until they issue a fix before you use this product
