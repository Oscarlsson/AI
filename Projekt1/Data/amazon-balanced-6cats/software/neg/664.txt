Well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly, but if you're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...I wouldn't recommend this.
I was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but I have no idea what any words in the sentence/caption actually mean.  
I've used it for a month know and I have no greater knowledge of Chinese than when I started....
