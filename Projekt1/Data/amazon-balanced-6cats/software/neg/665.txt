If you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of Chinese, stay away from this product.  Rosetta Stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven (the critical language learning years), but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use.  The object of the "game" is to match a Mandarin phrase (said aloud and written in pinyin) to a poor, pixellated photo.  For example, in the first section of the first lesson, you are shown a ball, an airplane, an elephant and a horse.  A phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo.  It gets much too complicated after that.  Basically, it's a pure guessing game for most of the time.  I gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews.  I thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance, but I feel as though I wasted hours and hours.  I can remember only two or three words from the entire experience.  Although I have spent fewer hours on Pimsleur's Mandarin audio lessons, I am able to recall many, many more words and phrases.  Although Pimsleur's isn't perfect, it's definitely the best choice for a beginner (along with a solid Chinese-English dictionary).

If you do not know well the basics of Mandarin, this software is completely useless.  Buy Pimsleur's instead
