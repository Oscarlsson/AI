You've got to be kidding me. There is no English translation, just pictures and Mandarin phrases.

How are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase?

They're suppose to be teaching Mandarin to an English speaker, not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language.

This is retarded. Worst product ever.
