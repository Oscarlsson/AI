Their approach might work for other languages, but for Chinese it's critically important to understand the grammar of the language, which Rosetta Stone never explains. It simply displays four pictures at you, with some incomprehensible (to a beginner) Chinese near them, and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures. I've taken Chinese for two years, and I still found it impossible to learn anything from it. I either knew the words already, or I couldn't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach.

I would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a Mandarin college course, but I can't find anything like this for sale or free online
