I liked the software itself.  Being the first year I used it, I thought I'd start being a regular TT customer.

Then it was April 17 2007 and I tried to e-file.  The servers would not respond ALL DAY. There were no admins to be reached on the support sites or the forums (except for one who said "I don't know what is the problem and I have nothing to tell you").

One major failing with this software is that it cannot AUTOMATICALLY try to connect.  If it fails, it says "try again in 10 minutes".  Which I've had to do all night.

Now - I will miss my tax deadline and have spent 6 hours at my computer trying to get connected.  Mail is not an option now as my car is gone.

This is a major failure of the company and an utter lack of support, since their officials apparently couldn't be bothered to come in to work on tax day to offer us any solutions.

I will not buy again.
