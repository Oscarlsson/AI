This is a product that is dependent on constant upgrades because the most current version of the 2006 tax forms are often not available when it first comes out.  That is the nature of the product.  

However, for the third year in a row, many Macintosh users have run into problems with their automated online form upgrade process.  If the automated upgrade process does not work, you can do the upgrade manually, but that is a somewhat complex process.  Alternatively, you can order a snail mail version of the upgraded program, if you can ever get through to the phone number you have to call.  They always seem to be encountering a large volume of calls no matter what time you call.  

Its a great product once you get it upgraded to contain the most recent version of the forms.  I wonder if the automated upgrade process works for Windows users?  At any rate, until they fix the automated upgrade process, an important part of the software, I have to rate it as low as possible
