Having used Turbo Tax since 1990 I feel that I am qualified to comment on it.
I have also used Quicken, Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Home & Business, QuickBooks Pro 2003 & QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition. The Turbo Tax product seems to get more user UN-FRIENDLY each year.  The navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's.  Like I said I WAS using QuickBooks Pro 2003 until tax time last year.  I purchased Turbo Tax Home & Business like I had for the past 4 years, and really got a shock when I found out that it would not import my data from QuickBooks Pro 2003.  Three year old software that was not compatible with Turbo Tax in 2006(actually 2005 tax year).  I ended up purchasing QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition 2006 
($280+) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done.  Intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed.  I am done with them and will purchase TaxCut this year
