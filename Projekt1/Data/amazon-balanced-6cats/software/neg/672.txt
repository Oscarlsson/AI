Mutual fund basis calculations are broken,  updates fail on the mac.  Not to mention no state in this edition.  It's absurd how many different versions of TurboTax there are this year.  It almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes.  I'm done with TurboTax, switching to TaxCu
