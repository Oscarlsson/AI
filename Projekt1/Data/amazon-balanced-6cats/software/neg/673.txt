Have used TurboTax for years with no real problems.  The low rating is due to the following:

Bought this in a store and discovered later when trying to download the state that it is FEDERAL ONLY!  If I had known that I would have ponied up the extra minor $ in the store rather than the extra $30 for download.  

Last year the state was included with this version - this year Intuit's new fine-grained tiering of their product line ripped me off!

Also, the price for this product is way too high, and the lack of an upgrade path is (pay less if you are a loyal customer) completely sucks.  Intuit almost lost me a couple of years ago when they introduced product activation.  They are in serious danger of losing me again
