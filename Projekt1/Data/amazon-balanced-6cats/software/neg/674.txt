I have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed Norton anti-virus programs.  I purchased the 3-pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired.  I then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer.  When I contacted Norton, they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full.  When the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer.  Norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers.  I will never purchase another Norton product
