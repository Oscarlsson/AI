I spent 3 days trying to get this installed.  I think the complication was that I had Norton Systemworks 2005 and wanted to add the NAV 2006 on top of it.  Well I finally got it done, but not until I'd restored my system to a backup from before I'd installed NSW 2005.  At that point I had NSW 2003 installed.  I had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry.  Norton's automated uninstall failed over and over so I gave up on that and did it by hand.  Then I installed NSW 2005 with NAV.  When I went to install NAV 2006 it was unable to uninstall the old version.  So I had to restore the system again.  This time I installed NSW 2005 without NAV.  I was then able to install NAV 2006.  It is working now.  It just shouldn't be this difficult
