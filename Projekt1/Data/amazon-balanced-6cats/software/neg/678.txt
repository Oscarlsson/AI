Bought the 3pack for home use.  Installed it on two pc's and then had defective a defective new pc that it was installed on and removed.  NOW, it won't let me activate on the new computer - their system is flawed!!!!  They want me to mail in original invoice, unlock code and disk and THEN they'll see what they want to do.  This will all take at least 2 to 3 weeks, in the meantime there is no protection on this computer.  HAAAAA!

They really need to have a specific code for each activation so that it updates to the active computer it is being used on - they really could figure this out.  They're taking the easy way out and getting more $$$ in the process.

This combined with all other slow down issues, I'm switching to ZONE Suite, as I've used Zone Alarm for years and it is great.

Best of luck
