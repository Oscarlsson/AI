The first order I received for Italian 1 and 2  had defective disks, which were not replaced by the manufacturer when I called their customer service.  When I re-submitted my complaint to Amazon, they immediately sent me a replacement of the whole set. However, these disks also are very slow to load on my new MacPro laptop, and quit at times. I am not able to recommend Rosetta Stone
