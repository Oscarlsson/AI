I specifically bought Turbo Tax Premier because of stocks sales/purchases we made in 2006.  The section on stock income was confusing and it took me several times to figure out what information Turbo Tax wanted where.  When I thought I had it figured out and finished that section, I thought I would repeat it to make sure I did it right.  To my surprise, the second time I entered the information I received a different total than the first time.  So I did it a third time.  The third time matched the second, so I figured it must be right.  Then when I got to the section for error checking, I was told I had errors in my stock sales.  So I did it a forth time, which came out the same as the second and third time.  This time it passed the error checking, but instead of showing that we had purchased the stocks, Turbo Tax showed we had "inherited" the stocks.  I could not get Turbo Tax to change, so I printed out the form scratched out "inherited" and put in the date of purchase.  I would rather do my taxes by hand than use Turbo Tax again
