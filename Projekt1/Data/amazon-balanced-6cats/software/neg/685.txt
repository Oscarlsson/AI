I have been using Turbo Tax for years just as I jave used Quicken for years.  One of the big plusses for me was It's Deductible, a program that places values on items you give to charities and imports directly into Turbo Tax.  

It's Deductible was a stand alone program until 2006 when it went to Intuit for online entries.  You could not longer buy the program to install on your PC.  This would have been OK but then Intuit would not allow you to see the values placed on donations until you purchased Turbo Tax.  Intuit thinking of the bottom line rather than the customer.  I hated that and told Intuit my feelings - no response as I expected.  But what the heck, I entered my donations through 2006 and when Turbo Tax 2006 came out I purchased it from Amazon for a good price.

After installing Turbo Tax I went to see what my donation values were and to import the values into Turbo Tax from my online entries.  Nope - No can do.  Not only was It's Deductible buried in Turbo Tax with a very clunky and slow link to start the program but there was absolutely no way to import.  After much searching on Intuit's support pages - always a chore - I finally found a page explaining - no import.  But if you like you can get a voucher to unlock the online values and then manually re enter the information into Turbo Tax!  What a crock.  On top of that using It's Deductible and Turbo Tax slows my duo core PC to a crawl.  I will look elsewhere next year
