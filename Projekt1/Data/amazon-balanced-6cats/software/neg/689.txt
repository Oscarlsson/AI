I'm good with computers and have used other architectural software, and this was most disappointing.  In fact, if I had not bought this on Amazon, I would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints.  It was difficult to install--buggy.  It had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up.  The "objects" that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized--and sometimes cannot.  Hardly intuitive at all.  Also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up.  I had reasonable expectations for this software, but wish I had bought something else.  For $10 it would be a good purchase.  For anything over that, you are wasting your money.  Try another product, a demo first, or something.  But in my opinion this was a big waste of money
