I was so excited to get this! The terrain on our lot has quite a slant to it because we're on a hill. My husband and I thought this would easily help us create a materials list for our retaining walls that we wanted to put out front. Long story short... I spent hours (at least 40) getting the dimensions of our house correct and trying to get the yard right. We even rented a surveying instrument to determine the slope of our yard to input elevation points. MANY hours wasted... the software does not let you set the height of the retaining walls and it inputs random walls and pieces of wall in the 3-D view that you can't get rid of. The flowers are hard to place, they don't end up where you want them.  Besides, the "Plant Chooser" doesn't have hardly any perrenial plants to choose from.  

Bottom line: I spent $50 in software costs and $50 for a surveying instrument and ended up having to calculate the wall length and height manually.  If you have a flat lot, this might work well for you.  For anyone that has hills, or slopes to their yard, Good luck!
