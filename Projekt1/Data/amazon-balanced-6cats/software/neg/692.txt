I work for a software company so I know a little about the user interface concept.  This is one of the worst packages I have ever used.  I just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right.  The automatic dimension builder did not work.  I had to draw it, and redraw it to get the dimensions right.  Then I added a few windows and doors, and 2 porches. Then I tried to use the camera to get a vertical view.  The whole file blew up - can't find it anywhere.  The manual is useless, and the tutorial CD is just an overview of each topic.  What a waste of moeny
