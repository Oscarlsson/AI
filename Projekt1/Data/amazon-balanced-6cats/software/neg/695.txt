I have moderate knowledge of computers, etc. and I found this overly complicated.  This is not intended for the novice.  However, even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money.  I wish I had not bought it at all.  Perhaps it has secrets and treasures I am not aware of...but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them.  Save your money...this was a waste
