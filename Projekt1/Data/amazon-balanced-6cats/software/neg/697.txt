This game can get very boring. It's very confusing and hard to control. It is sooooo frustrating!!!!!!!!! The instruction booklet doesn't come in handy either. Like some other people, I only got rabbits too. I bought this game because I wanted to heal cats and horses. But, only rabbits came. Buying this game was a big mistake. It is reallly no fun. Don't waste your money on this game. I gave up about a month ago. I've left it on the shelf and haven't touched it since.
