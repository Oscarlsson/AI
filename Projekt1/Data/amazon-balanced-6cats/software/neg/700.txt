Conceptually this is a great game, especially for a child with visions of being a Vet. You (can theoretically) learn about animals, their care and health issues. Those 2 stars for overall are basically for the concept and little else.

Unfortunately the general usability of this game, vis-à-vis lousy controls, is quite low. It's nearly impossible to move the character at times, which results in stressful failure in the game. It crashes. It can't remember simple settings like, leave the terribly loud and obnoxious music off. 

Playing this multiple times with my 6 year old always goes from excitement to frustration (bordering on tears more than once as a bunny gets woefully ill while your character is comically stuck bouncing between the sofa and ottoman).  

Once going you can engage your child by "studying" the books you've bought. Also, as you analyze the patients you learn about ailments as well as the treatments. That is all good stuff, but on whole the game is too frustrating to enjoy. 

One final note, this is the first time I've ever bothered to review any product.
