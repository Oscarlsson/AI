I was very excited to get this game.  I did read previously written reviews. My 13 yr old daughter wants to become a veterinarian someday and loves spending time on the computer, so this just seemed like the perfect Christmas gift.  Alas, the game has many faults that does interfere with the game being enjoyable!  I should have listened to the reviews.....

The game is extremely glichy!  It makes playing it very hard and frustrating.  My daughter tried for one week and has given up.  The characters get stuck and just stand and vibrate on the screen until you start the game over.  Sometimes she will play for a half hour before it starts up and sometimes it does this right away.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  

Also, some internal setup issues of the actual CD is that it works better running from the disk then saving it to the computers hard drive.  We have a pretty new computer, we have windows XP - this program just doesn't run well off our computer anyway.  We have other games that don't have this problem. In fact my son got a game - building machines and inventions - and it doesn't have any of these problems and actually requires more from my hard drive.

Also, my daughter complains of some of the limitations within pet vet that don't allow her to change.  You have to pay a specified amount to hire an employee and the employee in this game is a slouch - there are no other choices when hiring staff, no wage choices, you can't get this employee to work or and you cannot hire anyone else.  

Overall because of the gliches in the game, she hasn't been able to play it to the programs full potential and has given up....so the idea is great.. but the makers should have looked at this better before taking the consumers money and putting it on the market.  I cannot find any fixes or downloads online to repair it either.  BIG BUMMER!!!  BEWARE!  JUST DON'T BUY THIS ONE, LOOK ELSEWHERE
