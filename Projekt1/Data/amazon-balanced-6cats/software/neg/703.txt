I am a retired senior software engineer (web development).  I've used many antivirus/malware packages both at work and at home.  This is the ABSOLUTE WORST.  After installing it, I got popup virus alerts from BitDefender every 10 seconds.  No kidding.  I couldn't believe it.  I previously had a copy of Norton AntiVirus 5 on my computer which is highly reliable (not like the latest version).  I tried BitDefender based on the reviews below which were obviously written by people with less than standard operating systems.  I use a PC with Windows XP SP2 and IE6 (IE7 is still buggy).  Although multiple runs of BitDefender show absolutely no viruses or malware on my system, I continue to get these popup "virus alerts" every 10 seconds when I browse the internet, which is way more irritating than anything Norton ever did to my computer.  In addition, it drags my computer to almost a screeching halt when I go to a web page I haven't been to in more than a day, sometimes even the ones I just went to an hour ago.  I find this truly irritating and went to BitDefender's website and tried their online chat.  "Jack" was completely worthless.  He told me to completely wipe out my cookies, as well as a lot of other useful files for no apparent reason other than he's probably not named Jack, but something like Vishnu and this was the first thing on a long list of things to tell people to do.  Very useless.  Not recommended for anyone.  Try to get an old copy of Norton Antivirus 5 and pay for the update feature ($20 per year).  Much better than this garbage.  

In addition, there are virtually no options to customizing this product.  You're stuck with what they think is necessary (like automatically deleting internet files you may need--like shopping carts).  It literally cripples your computer.
