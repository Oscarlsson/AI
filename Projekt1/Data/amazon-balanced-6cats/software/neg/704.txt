I made the unfortunate mistake of reading fantastic reviews for this product and trying it out myself.  I went online and purchased the program, downloaded, and installed on my pc.  Installation worked perfectly. I ran a scan and it even found viruses that Mcafee missed. However, any program that used the internet now freezes or takes forever to load. After closing web browsers I have to restart before my PC recovers.  I unistalled the program and now everything works great.  I'm shopping somewhere else for my Antivirus needs
