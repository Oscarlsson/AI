I'd give this no stars but it won't let me.

Why would anyone buy this? I was in Compusa today as they are closing down on Long Island & thought about buying this. I put it down & said I will researh this more at home. As I suspected, you can go to [...] & do the same thing that this software does. The software doesn't allow you to print stamps at home so what's the point? The only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps, so it's like buying a [...] coupon, that's a one time use. I don't get it
