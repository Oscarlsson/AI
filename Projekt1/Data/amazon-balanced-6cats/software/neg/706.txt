I brought the software beleiving that it would help me with my scrapbooking.  It has very limited graphics and templates to work
with.  I would not recomend this software package.  Also the journaling sucks as well.  Even when you start a product from scratch the software isn't user friendly with very little guidence. As stated before 1 star is to much.
