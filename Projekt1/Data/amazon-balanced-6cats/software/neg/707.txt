Complete waste of money.  I purchased my copy at Wal-Mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did.  The graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful.  The actaul program is SO not like that.  The graphics are down right cheesy, and low budget.  Having only paid $9 for this program, I feel like I was completely ripped off.  I'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund. 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item
