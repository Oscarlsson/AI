This program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts.
It is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic. The word bubble sdo not rotate, so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to.

It looks really great on the cover of the CD, and that's what sold me.
It was a disapointing christmas
