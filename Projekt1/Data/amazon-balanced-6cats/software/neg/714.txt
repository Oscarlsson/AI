When I considered purchasing this product, I was confused to see that some people thought it was great, and others thought it was terrible.  I couldn't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews.

After I bought it I understood: For some of the things it does, it works fine -- no problems.  However, there are many major bugs in the software, and if you need one of the buggy functions, you'll be sorry you bought it.

Examples of some problems: 

1. If you burn an audio track entitled "Blue Fog" Nero will give it the title "Fog."

2. Every time I run a backup, it tells me there was a write error, but the backup seems OK.

3. I backed up every file on my drive, but when my system crashed, there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system.

4. It has blue screened my system one time.

5. Many commands are poorly or not at all documented.  For example, the wave editor has a declipper function, but there is no documentation on how to use it.

So, I'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product.

Good luck
