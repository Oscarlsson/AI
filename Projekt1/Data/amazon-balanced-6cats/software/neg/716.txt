I could be home in bed. But I'm Fing around trying to undo the install of the biggest mistake I've made to date...purchasing, tossing money in the toilet for Nero7. The damage and the time it's taken to recover is about 20 times it's cost. Useless. I can't copy a disk. I can't burn and image. What's the deal??? 

All the negative stuff I've read true. Unfortunately AFTER I paid for Nero7 BEFORE reading what others have to say. 

What really puzzles me is who all the folks are that are writing all the wonderful reviews? Employees of Ahead? 

Keep your distance or you'll be sorry
