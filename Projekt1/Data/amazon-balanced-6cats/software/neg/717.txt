Nero 7 wants to prevent you from generating ISO files and instead wants you to use its NRG CD backup file system. Then it doesn't want you to burn WAV onto CD but forces you to invest in MP3 encryption so that you can burn MP3 to CD. The software is full of these horrible twists that Nero has gone from the best burning rom to the worst burning rom by simply making it harder for you to do what you want. I rolled back to Nero 5.5 and had a fully functional and top of the line burning rom again
