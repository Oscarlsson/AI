This product is worse than useless.  Right off the bat, the tutorials do not behave as depicted.  What is left does not run properly.  I spent hours and hours trying to make a CD from an LP, all to no avail.To make matters worse, this bug infested monstrosity, has very poor support.  There is no 800 number.  The version that I had came with 10 days of tecnical assistance that was useless!  After the 10 days, technical assistance costs $1.29 a minute, plus the cost of the long distance call!
I REPEAT!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
