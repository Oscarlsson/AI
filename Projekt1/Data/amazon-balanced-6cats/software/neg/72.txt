I used Easy Creator 4 for years. Bought new computers so bought Easy Creator 6. It will not work on 2 E-Machines with XP. It wipes out CD rom drive so that it is unusable. I requested tech support 6/12/06. It's 7/15/06 and I am still waiting. I uninstalled it. I found Easy Creator 5 platinum on Amazon and ordered it. It works
