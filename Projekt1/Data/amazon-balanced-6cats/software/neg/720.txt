Ever since Adobe bought out this small operation, customer service has been severely lacking.  Software will NOT work on Excel 2007.   The promise for additional POWERLOOKS has become dead.  Granted that the program makes presentation more interesting, the Powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website.  This is highly disappointing as I purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the Powerlook templates.
