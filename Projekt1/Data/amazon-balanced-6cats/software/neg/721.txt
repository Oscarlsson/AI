First, I should have listened to my instincts and downloaded the trial version BEFORE purchasing.  Had I done this I would HAVE NEVER purchased this product.  As it is, having bought the product from a box store and NOT online, I made a $99.00 mistake, plus tax.  

The product has too many limitations to be considered as a viable add-on to your powerpoint presentations.  As a presenter, using PPT every week, in training presentations, I can tell you that this product does more to limit PPT's slide producing capabilities than it does to add to them.  As a matter of fact, I found the product to "take away" from PPT's slide building procedures, NOT "add" to them.  

Save your money and wait for the next PPT add-on to come along.  This product is worth neither your investigative time, nor your monetary investment
