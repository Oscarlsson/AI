You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have. 
Don't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it. Many changes are literally imposed on you, like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars. Missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return. 
There are new features which can be helpful to some, but Microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining. 

The arrogance of Microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible. 
You upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual.
