Far from user-friendly, you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks, wondering "Why did I get this program again?" Its like reading another language after using previous editions of Word, which I was a big fan of. I guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it's a nuisance. I can't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit. In the words of Thoreau "Simplify."
Good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they won't be able to view the newere version. Get used to saving in "97-2003 Word Format." Also, won't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner. At this price, you could do without the headache.
