I have always used Norton antivirus, and had no problems with it at all. I have recently had to migrate to Outlook 2003 and Norton IS 2005 and have non-stop system crashes. I have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of Norton Professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load.
