I have always used the other well-known office suites in the past but when I received an offer on this suite at a significant discount, I thought I would try it.  I should mention I'm a doctoral student in the middle of a dissertation, so the challenge was to migrate important data and documents into WordPerfect and Quattro Pro.  While I was able to get it done the Quattro Pro interface with SPSS, which had worked seemlessly with the other spreadsheet, failed horribly.  Not to mention the complicated details of what should be simple document formatting--the Visual Basic Editor kept freezing or denying me access.

Invest in a better product if you have serious work.  I've gone back to the benchmark office suite product
