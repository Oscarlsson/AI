Quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for Intuit products and services.  In my opinion, it is fine to offer additional services to customers, but give the customer the opportunity to say "no thanks" and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software.  Forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea.  Advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity
