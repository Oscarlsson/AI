I've only had this software for a few months and already know half of the tech support population of Bangalore, India. One problem with this software is that it has an auto update function that results in "Patch Engine Error," which I've solved through versions 2, 3 and 4. Another problem is with Quicken's servers, resulting in CC-501, CC-502 and CC-899 errors. Translation: Quicken's servers are unable to reliably update your bank account information. Today, in the time it took Pandeep to respond to one of my online chat questions, I was able to migrate a dozen accounts to MSN's free online version of Money, which updated all of my bank accounts easily. Conclusion: Save your receipt for their 60-day refund
