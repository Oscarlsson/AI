I have been a long time user and have always had good success until the 2007. 

I have tried to install on my new PC and have not been successful. I called Intuit Phone support and spent and hour changing setting on my computer. We did the usual things for WinXP Pro:

1. Set up a new account to verify it isn't a permission problem
2. Shut off all service and switched to safe mode

None of these made a difference. So the Support Technician told me to call Microsoft and then hung up. That was it, no chance to even complain, just a dead phone line.

Luckly, I know enough to put my PC back in worki9ng order but this is pretty lame support. 

I never though Microsoft would get me to switch and they haven't but Intuit has forced me off all on their own.
