From my experience just about all support calls are routed off shore.
Most of the tech support staff just take your question and type it into their work station. They say "May I put you on hold while I check my resources". Then they read answers off their screen. Several times I had to say to the tech - I can't understand your English. If you buy the package I'd find a local QB certified accountant and pay him/her for their time.
