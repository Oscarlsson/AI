When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data.  I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now.  Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer.  I've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones.
Intuit's support sucks and cannot seem to resolve my problems.  I have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer.  My recommendation is if you are using the 2005 version, and don't need tax tables, don't mess with 2006 version.  It has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own
