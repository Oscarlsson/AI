this product does nothing.  i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied.  easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn.  everything is copy protected...and i hear that over and over again.  there is a reason why this product is so cheap...BECAUSE IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL!  u CANT burn dvds.  you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player.  thats it.  dont waste you money on this.  its worthless..
