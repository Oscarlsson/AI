It's a piece of junk, so save your money and some headaches. Even Dell technicians can't fix it.   My new Dell computer had Norton Ghost pre-installed with a back-up hard drive just for cloning.  It sounded like a perfect setup except my Norton Ghost wouldn't work.  Contacted Dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with Norton to no avail.  Now I'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me
