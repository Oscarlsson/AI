Don't waste your time and money!! EXTREMELY poor product support! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit, then you're stuck with worthless software.
I installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it. Then my computer crashed and I lost everything. I thought I was covered since I just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when I tried to do a restore Norton Ghost wouldn't recognize my external hard disk.
I spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours. Nobody called!
I bought their Extended Download service and tried to download the product again. It didn't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone I still haven't got a working copy. The product key they said I needed and I tried to use also doesn't work. I'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but I expect the same result - NO credit back and software that doesn't do what Norton said it would do
