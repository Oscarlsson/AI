I have used this procuct in the past with great success, but Ghost 10 is useless. Symantec tech support is (as far as I can tell, been doing computers since 1957) the worst. If you get the Boxed version It says PC Magzine September 2004 "Belongs in every serious PC user's toolbox."  Think about it using a 2004 quote. In 2004 and 2005 I would agree.  The 1st sys I installed Ghost 10 is a Dell XPX600, Boot disk will not work, BackUp will not work, blue screen when backing up.
Tech support directed me to web sites that don't exist, and the sites that did come up didn't have the files NU tech listed.  Dell Workstations 530 and 360 both dual processor, no games, 15,000 Scsi Raid, 4GB mem, 1GB nVidia, Dual Displays -- They Crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled. System works 2005 expired I couldn't use my Ghost 9 backups, and I kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by NU, the systems were shipped to Panama and were in Customs for over 6 mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer, but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me Sys Works was not up to date I reformated. I purchased (in anticipation of setting up my computers) boxed from Amazon and download from NU Ghost 10,Sys Wrks prem, NU int sec (2007 versions) but couldn't install them. That was Mid December 2006, now its January 19, 2007 and still not one answer from NU that works, yes all systems are pluged in to  TrippLite Smart3000RMU & TrippLite line condidtoners (2 Batery Backup Units), the computers lived in ST Maarten and the power was 105 to 140 volts with lots of downtime.
Panama weather, people, public offices are great (Driver lic $24 Lic plates $30 for 3 years, St Maarten driver lic $450 for 2 years, Lic plates $400 yr) sailing is better in ST Maarten. Life in Panama ( and I don't speek Spanish yet )is good Norton is bad. l read a lot mostly tech books, I purchase tools, electronic gear, software, computer hardware, etc without Amazon it would be hard to live offshore,no need to go to Borders, Amazon is online 24 7.
