I bought this for my two sons, ages 6 and 8, to help them develop speed with their memory math skills.  What a disappointment.  Even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game.  Each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off.  Good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed.  I wish I'd purchased a different product
