Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.
Went to website, downloaded patch. It said I had the latest patch already.
Everywhere you go on the roxio website, it tells you you can upgrade to version 8 for $20 off. It still is more than $50 and if Version 6 doesn't work, why would I throw more money at the problem?

I could find no usefull information on the website and no way to speak to someone.

I took it back to Best Buy. They said they could only exchange it for the same piece of junk. I went next door to Staples and they said if I bought software that does not work from them, they would refund my money if I bought it back within 14 days. So, I found a new source for software.

Pros: 
It did not crash my laptop
It did not cause the modem to dial international calls

Cons:
Doesn't work
no tech support
doesn't work
no tech suppor
