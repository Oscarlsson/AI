This concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible.  My 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse.  And we couldn't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game.  And playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels.  And...did they actually test this thing on humans?  What a waste of potential.  It is a good concept
