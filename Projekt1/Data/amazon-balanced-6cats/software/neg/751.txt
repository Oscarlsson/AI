My son had an earlier version of Math Blaster, it was wonderful.  I saw this new version and expected more of the same.  WRONG!!  After 10 minutes of loud sounds, and pulsing video, he was complaining.  It was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff. Never could get to a point where learning might take place.  Wish I could get my money back.  

After this disaster, we purchased Mia's Math Adventure. This was more in tune with the first Math Blaster.
