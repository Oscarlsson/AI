I just got a 2006 version of math blasters, I played it for a while and I thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all! I think that anyone who plays it will probably fall right to sleep when they start playing! The box it came in said it was for age 6-12 but I think it is for 6 or 7 year old kids. I really dont think this is a good game to play
