If you buy this be sure to set a Restore Point before installing. This may work if you have never installed any other Anti-Virus software. This is not for a novice computer user to install unless maybe you are installing on a brand new computer.

After uninstalling Norton (my previous anti virus software)I installed Kapersky and immediately had total system lockup with warning message from Windows (the old blue screen of death) saying a serious problem had occurred and if I had recently installed new hardware or software to uninstall it.  Which I did, then logged onto the Kapersky forum and was told to download a Norton Removal tool and run it and then reinstall.  I did this and still ended up with total lockup and warning message.  After three tries I gave up.  Luckily I had set Restore points and was able to get my system back and am now back to using Norton.  According to the forum there are also problems if you have installed McAfee.  I am running Windows XP.  Since I never got to use it I can't judge whether it has any value.
