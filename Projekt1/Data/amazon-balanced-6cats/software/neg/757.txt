I have this program on a 30-day demo.  It might be OK if I didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable.

I tried to run the system virus scan, as recommended, but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it couldn't seem to get past.  I skipped the file, but then it quickly got stuck again.  The "time remaining" said it would take 4 days to complete, so I cancelled that scan.

It has a learning mode that initally blocks EVERYTHING.  Apparently, this program has no brain.  For example, I have the Live Search Toolbar installed in Outlook.  It had to ask me if it was OK to run that dll file.  In fact, each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run.

Don't even get me started on the Quickbooks and Internet Explorer problems.  Which is what it wouldn't let those programs do, even after they had been run and I repeated clicked "allow" over and over.

Twice today it got so slow running IE that it finally crashed the computer so bad that  I had to do a hard re-boot.  If you have it checking ports on your computer, almost nothing would run or download on IE.

So, I'm going to demo a few more, but it's probably back to Windows Live OneCare, which I had the past year.  It just doesn't seem to do much (no long list of features), but it also doesn't jam everthing else up
