If I could give it 0 star, I would. My humble opinion is that Kaspersky is not better than Norton at slowing down your computer. One brand new computer, plenty of space and memory. One old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well. Each time Kaspersky updates, I can't open Outlook Express nor Explorer. Well, the programs do open actually but I have time to vacuum and dust before they're launched. I used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement.
