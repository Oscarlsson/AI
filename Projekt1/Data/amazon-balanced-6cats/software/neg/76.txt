I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features
