Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky.  After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted.  I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours.  Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key.  This did not work.  I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied.  I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied.  I emphatically advise against buying this product.  If you ever have a problem, you will not get help
