The graphics are clear, but they are bad! Horses look nothing like that and it is really gross! I would say get it for the younger kids, because they won't care.

There is nothing to do with the game except earn money, build your hotel, and keep your horse from getting sick. You don't get to ride that often because it said "you have ridden enough for this round" and it is very enoying. you can't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse, but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect. But you can't do that unless you can jump the horse alot, and you can't. It is easy to go 'bankrupt' so I would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing.

not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look, not for younger kids because of the money problems.
So don't get this game
