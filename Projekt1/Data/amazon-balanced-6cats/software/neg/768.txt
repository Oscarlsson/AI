If you have an older systemworks loaded, NSW will go to remove the older GO BACK version.  If it does, (depending on your system) OK.  However, if it wants you to go to Symantek web site and download a GO BACK removal toll, beware.  I downloaded it and ran it and it stated it wanted to restart my system.  What it did was screw up the partition and crashed the system.  GO Back puts your data in a seperate partition.  Symantek knows about this and has a "fix" you run before loading NSW, but they didn't let anyone know that it may crash your system.  On an older PC, without windows restore tool, it works OK.  However, if you have a newer PC with a windows resotre loaded and then have an older NSW GO back loaded, it will crash your PC if you use their GO Back removal tool.  Emailed Symantec twice, they stated they would get back in 7 days - never did.  Hope you have better luc
