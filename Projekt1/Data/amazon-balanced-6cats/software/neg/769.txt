The new Systemworks has a horrible interface.  You can't see what your options are easily.  You can't see the status of your components.  You can't see what version you have.  When you load it after loading Norton Personal Firewall 2006, the Firewall will not load program rules (you have to uninstall the Firewall and then reinstall it).  I'm not sure how the protection works, but the software "redesign" was done by an ergonomic moron
