The software installation is buggy.  It try's to download the entire installation from the SnapStream web site, even though there is a installation disk included.  If your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall Windows.  I have Windows XP SP2 with a flakey internet connection. Although I am computer literate, after two attempts to install this product I have chucked the whole thing out the window. P.S. SnapStream has no tech service department to speak of
