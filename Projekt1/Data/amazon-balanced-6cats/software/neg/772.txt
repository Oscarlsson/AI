After 25 years of building PC, and installing software, beta testing software, I am unable, even with Adobe's technical support staff to install Acrobat Version 8.  Software gets to the end of the install process and stalls.  No combination of repair, uninstall, reinstall, registry cleaning, advice from THREE technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem.  Using XP, with all the latest upgrades, defragging the drives, with 2 MB RAM, and a Adobe Tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software.
