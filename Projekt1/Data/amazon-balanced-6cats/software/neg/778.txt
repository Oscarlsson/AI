After spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions, I was still unable to install this on either of my PCs. They don't want to admit it, but their ad for Deduction Pro kills the software install at 21% (or 26% for the standard version). And no, their "font patch", killing all startup services, upgrading the Flash Player, nor starting in Safe Mode did not resolve the problem. I'm out the money on this and am switching to TurboTax. H&R Block has lost this customer.
