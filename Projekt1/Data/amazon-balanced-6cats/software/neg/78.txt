It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money. 

Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical.

After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is!

As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.
