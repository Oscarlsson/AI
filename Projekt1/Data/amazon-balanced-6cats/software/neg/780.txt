I just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer.  When I got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains, I couldn't figure out how to import the data from Fidelity that I've done for the last few years.  Looking around on the Fidelity website, I can across the following statement: "For the 2005 tax year, Fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into H&R Block's TaxCut programs. H&R Block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year."  Unfortunately, this is the reason I'm using a software tax prep program, looks like it's back to TurboTax
