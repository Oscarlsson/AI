I was a private beta tester for the new OS. I tested the software for a whole year and I am not pleased with it.

If you depend on stability for your existing software, you are out of luck. The hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible. Many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use Windows Vista. 

You are better off upgrading to a Mac. After all, Microsoft did steal many ideas from Apple Computers.
