I hate this product. Since I'm used to Office 2003 (at work), opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock. The layout is irritating, poorly designed, and does not provide sufficient features. To make things worse, this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to CD. The one-star rating was too generous.
