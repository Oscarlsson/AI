I bought this program because I wanted to use it on the pocket pc (DELL Axim X50v).  The program is very confusing to use.  It took some time to load on the PPC first, then you have to load the maps.  I tried to load the map of the whole state and it wasn't working. The map would come up and the gps reciever would pick up where I was, but when I would write an address of a street that exists, it would say "SEARCH DONE, NO MATCH FOUND."  I called the Delorme support many times, they helped me go through the application, but I feel that this application wont give me directions that I want off of the PPC.  

I should have bought the iguidance.  One of my friends has this application and it is awesome.  He loaded 3 states all at once and it gives you directions very easily.  There are many points of interest.
I particularly like the screen that shows you all the streets in a 3D fashion.  It is easy to use.
