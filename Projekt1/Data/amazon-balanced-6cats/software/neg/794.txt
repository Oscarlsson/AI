Unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets.  Spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments.  This is not always practical.  The tripod mount fits too loose on Spyder and easily falls off.  I think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product, but not yet ready for prime time
