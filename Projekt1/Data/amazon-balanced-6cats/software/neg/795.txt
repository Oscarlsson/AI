I am really thinking of returning it to Amazon. I think I will stick with good-'ol MS Word. You see I wanted a 12-page form and spent two days creating it. It's a form to survey boats so it also had graphic areas for photos (about 12). Well, all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to .pdf. The size of the created .pdf was near 10MB! (Similary done with MS word resulted in a 1.2MB finished .pdf). Well, I can't be e-mailing 10MB files!
I also recieved the book for the 5.0 filler which says it can use Dragon Naturally Speaking (I use that). I'll be darned if I can figure out where that tool is, "you must activate voice recognition in the tool bar." And, if you use Dragon Naturally Speaking in the form filler area all sentences start out without capital letters, say and select does not work. (I should note that Dragon Naturally Speaking works flawlessly in MS Word!) So, you manually have to go back and capitalize each sentence. Finally, as others have said, there is no FAQ and generally no troubleshooting help on the ScanSoft web site.  This is very poor for a near $100 product. There would be no way that I would spend $700 on their premium edition.
