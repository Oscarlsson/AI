Do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date.  (The receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days.) You don't have much time to return an item, and the company does not give any leeway for Christmas orders.  I am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room, and I can't exchange it for another item because he didn't like any of their products.
