Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review.
These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone. 
If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs. 
(My apologies to grandmothers with corded, dial, yellow wall phones). (Actually, I kinda wish I had one!)
