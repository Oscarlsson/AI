I bought this product because I thought Norton was a quality product. Man did I make a mistake buying this product. I only had it on my computer for 1 month and it made my computer crawl , almost to where it would not  hardly work. I deleted it . Then my computer starting working just fine. This happened to me 2 times before I got tired of it and trashed it.
