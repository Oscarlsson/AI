I bought a new Desktop PC installed with Vista.  It came preinstalled with McAfee 2007.  I have been using Norton products for years, so I bought a 3 user package of North Internet Security 2007.  For the 60 days of the trial, my computer ran flawlessly.  But it was time to install Norton as McAfee had run its course.  I installed the program last night, which took 45 minutes with the Vista update from Symantec, required updates, restarts and the full system scan.  After this time my computer, which as I said ran flawlessly for 60 days, well now every 60 minutes I get the blue screen of death and a forced restart.  I contacted Symantec's customer support only to be greeted with an hour and forty five minutes wait to chat with an analysts (seems that I was not the only one with Norton troubles).   After all this time, the advice I was given was....uninstall and reinstall!!!!  Gee, Einstein, I would have never done that already before I wasted my time contacting you.  But the Symantec analyst was firm that this was the problem.  So I took my morning and uninstalled and reinstalled and...THE SAME BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH but now in under an hour of use!!!  I'm uninstalling this virus and buying a McAfee package ASAP.  

Oh also, during the time my computer was not crashing, it ran SLOW!!  It is a 2.8 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram but it ran as if it were a 386 processor with 32 megs of ram.  And everything you run, Norton needs you to approve its connection...EVERYTHING.  You can allow Norton to decide what can and cannot connect so you do not have to click every five second, but then you will not be able to user 1/2 of your programs as the geniuses at Norton did not include them in their `safe' list.
I regret buying this and only wish I could give it ZERO stars!!!
