Norton is now owned by the huge behemouth Digital River, who haven't a clue how to run support or customer service.  They are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it, wouldn't consider it.  Norton used to be top notch, now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer.  It interferes with everything.  Microsoft seems to have given up on them too, as Norton has not bothered to interface properly with Windows, a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic.  I can only warn you ~ AVOID!!!  A bad bit of software and a company that hasn't any clue about what customer service is and doesn't look likely to change.  Profit seems to be likely more important to them than service or keeping the Norton family of software up to date and working well...
