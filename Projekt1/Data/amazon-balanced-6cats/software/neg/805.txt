This product is horrifying. It worked for three months, at which point it experienced a complete meltdown. Started getting Auto-Protect errors, and suddenly could access the internet with Explorer, but not Firefox. It kept trying to send me to Live Update, which wouldn't work, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton. Now the error happened again, and I could access the internet with Firefox, but not Explorer. An error message referred me to an online "fix," but -- guess what! -- you can't access any of their fixes with Firefox. You MUST be using Explorer. (Which is, in and of itself, offensive and obnoxious.) Explorer, of course, wasn't working. (Incidentally, with Norton uninstalled, all worked fine, so that was indeed the source of the problem.) Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton again, hoping to get on Explorer and get the fix before the error recurred, but now I couldn't get on the internet AT ALL. At that point, I uninstalled Norton for good. Ditto on the fact that they don't support the product, apparently don't stand behind the product, and apparently aren't very concerned about their reputation. Very disappointing. Previous versions were just fine; this is a complete mess
