Bought System mechanic 6 pro online, it repairs but reports problems but you cannot get information at all. None of the modules report what is being done. If you need assistance forget it, all you get from IOLO is go see the FAQ's, I don't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!
