Save your money!!!

I used the evaluation version of System Mechanic version 6 for 29 days and thought it was great enough that I paid for and upgraded to System Mechanic Professional version on the subscription option for $69.95.

I download the installer and ran it at 7:30 am on Sunday morning.  None of the modules, I repeat NONE worked.  I uninstalled.  Cleaned out my registery and directories of all traces of this and the previous version and reinstalled, several time to the point that I gave up at 8pm the sam night.  I search the online support and found no help.  I wrote an email and as of today (Wednesday) have not yet received a reply.  Their phone is constantly busy but I did get through last night at 7pm eastern time (they close at 8pm eastern/5pm pacific) and was transferred to tech support.  For the next hour I listened to the message: "All of our support specialist are busy.  Please stay on the line and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received" until 8pm when the recording switched over to: "Thank you for calling Iolo.  Our business hours are from 9am to 5pm pacific time.  Please call back during these hours."

I'm extremely upset.  I'm not a noob and have been using computers since the 386 days.

As soon as my American Express bill cycles, I will call and have the charge removed.

Version 6 was great, version 7 tanks.
