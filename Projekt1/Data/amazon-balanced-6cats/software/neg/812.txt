My daughter (13) and I tried The Number Devil together. She has ADD and has difficulty with math. We found the intro to be too long and the games boring.  This game did not keep her attention at all.  We also tried Math Blaster and would recommend that game instead. I am glad others have found this game helpful unfortunately it didnt for us.
