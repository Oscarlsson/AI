I installed this software after getting it free after rebates, and I must say I am not the least bit impressed. It claims to speed up your system, but instead only slows it down. Seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer, but it's relatively new and has a gig of memory. As another reviewer mentioned, my internet stopped working correctly (although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet!) and my system restore just wouldn't work. It deleted a lot of entries I needed to run my system correctly.

The anti-spyware was an absolute joke & the updates were large files almost every day. 8 MB a day practically.

On a lighter note, Fix-It Utilities found a virus other programs were unable to find.

I use Zone Alarm Security Suite and then use CCleaner to take care of the rest. I think they're the best combination. No program beats Zone Alarm's. Fast, secure, and won't bug down your computer. I had to reinstall my operating system thanks to Fix-It Utilities
