I installed the product hoping it would help me with all the errors I was getting (I have Windows XP). Well, 2 weeks and $200 it's what it took for me to have my computer repaired. It would not let me log on to windows, I got errors I've never seen and it completely messed all my files. BIG waste of money. I had to re-format my hard drive and my computer is only 1 month old!!
