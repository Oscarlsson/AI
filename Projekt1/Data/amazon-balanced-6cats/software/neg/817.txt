Purchased Fix-It Utilities 6 a few weeks back and installed it on my desk top running Windows XP.  Immediately after installation I ran the program and repaired only the minimum errors as recommended.  However, many programs on my computer would not run and could not access many files.  Called VCOM for help ,but  their solution did not work.  I was even unable to get system restore to correct the problem. I had to re-format my hard drive and re-install all my programs and files.  I cannot recommend this registry repair
