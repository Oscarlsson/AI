This OS is not for any ordinary user.  If you know nothing about drivers, peripherals, etc, then don't get this OS.  Lots of incompatability issues.  I thought this OS would make my gaming experience better, apparently it needs lots of work.  Can't play CS:S, Day of Defeat, Lord of the rings Online, etc.  BF2142 and some other games play slower in Vista compared to XP.  I hardly write reviews, but I just want everyone to know that this OS suxs!  Stay with XP Pro SP2.  Games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on XP.  It isn't worth getting right now, wait a year or two until it gets worked out.  Feels like BETA, which it shouldn't.  Microsoft, you get a F- for your new OS.  You fail.  Nice try
