I'm not a tech guy.  But from a simple user's standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance.  About 1/2 the software you might have purchased that worked with XP won't work with Vista.  

I was thinking that Vista would be an improvement.  But there is nothing there.  Just some minor superficial changes as far as I can tell.  Maybe for IT people, there might be some big difference, but for your average user, there is no improvement at all.

Save your money.  Don't buy it.
