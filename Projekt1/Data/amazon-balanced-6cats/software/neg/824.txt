You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.
15 years of Outlook and you can't print a single address label or an envelope with one click. (or 10 clicks for that matter)
There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either. 
Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things... 

Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer.
