I have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess.  They are also both very computer savy.  I bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy, but they say they find it boring and don't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces.  The characters are very difficult to identify and confusing, they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes.  I'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club
