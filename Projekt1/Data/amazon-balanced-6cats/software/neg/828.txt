I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again.  My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand.  You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date.  Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming.  His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught.  Again, the software is good but may not be the best on the market.  Then again, I've only purchased three titles, and this one offers a few things that the others don't include
