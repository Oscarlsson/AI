The problem with this game starts with the introductury movie... it develops slowly, goes on forever, suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play. 

Once game play FINALLY does start, my child found the games boring and the TRANSITIONS between the games tediously slow.  Cute characters...zero edutainment.  It was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day
