I have a 2 month old high-end Dell PC with tons of memory and disk, running Windows XP Pro.  This game doesn't work.  Period.  First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options.  Second, when I attempt to play a game, even at the settings that it chose, I get nothing but a white screen.  After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options.  Clicking on them does absolutely nothing!  It doesn't recognize my mouse clicks.

I'm assuming that the game was written for the Apple Mac, and ported to the PC.  Trust me, it doesn't work.  

BTW, we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them.  

Now I have to figure out how to return this silly thing.
