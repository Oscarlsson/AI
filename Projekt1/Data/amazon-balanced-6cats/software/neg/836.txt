Cakewalk"s advertisement saying something like..." no experience needed to operate this software..." is, in my mind, mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most. I've had it now for about three weeks, work on it most days, usually in the middle of the night so I can really concentrate on it, and still cant get anything out of it.
All I wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work...blues, pop, country....so far nothing and I am thinking about giving up.
I can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk I have ever seen.
BEWARE...unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed.
