This is the slowest. Operating. System I have ever used. The first time I installed XP Home, I didn't see what was so bad about it, but when we tried installing it on our new Gateway Machine, it imedettly slowed all system operations down to a crawl. Even My brother's laptop, which is a very Fast Machine, has XP pro, and it randomly slows down. Don't get this operating system. It's slow, buggy, and expensive
