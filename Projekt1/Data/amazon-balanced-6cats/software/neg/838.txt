This operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used--including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98. 

Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashes frequently-particularly if you like to work with several windows open at once. 

Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware. 

True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway. I had to hire an expensive data recovery guru-another story in itself. 

Even reinstalling the program did not solve the problem. My computer was completely compromised. I was eventually forced to junk the machine. 

After my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition, I have sworn off Windows forever. Mac and Linux are both far superior
