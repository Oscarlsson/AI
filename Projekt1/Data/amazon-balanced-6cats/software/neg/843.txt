I was able to install most of MS office but am having printer conpatability problems.   I wasn't able to install Vitural Pc properly and get error messages when i boot up.  I'm going to have to the Mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out.  All in all I think that every thing will work OK but I'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed.  Maybe it's best to stick with Mac software for Macs.  I've NEVER has a problem installing them
