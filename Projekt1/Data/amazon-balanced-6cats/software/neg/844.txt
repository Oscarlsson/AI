This product arrived with 2 number 2 installation disks for the Virtual PC and no number 1.  As a result, I was not able to install VPC, which was one of the reasons I purchased this overly expensive product.  The Office part does not seem that signicant an upgrade to the Office X that I had. So it is both an aggravation and a rip off
