Let's start with Outlook interface.  These are the exact words from their user manual:

"ACT! 2007 E-mail will work through Microsoft Outlook versions 2000, 2002 (XP) or 2003."

So those of us with newer versions of Outlook cannot synch the Outlook email or calendar with Act.  What's the point?  Then what are you supposed to synch with your Blackberry - Outlook so you can get your calendar and email information or Act so you can get your client database.
The Act email is so basic and primitive looking, you  can't put attractive auto signatures on it.

Then they tell you that you can have one month of telephone support, but it's only available during work days, not on the weekends.  Since I purchased the product on the weekend, I won't be able to speak with someone to ask for a full refund until Monday.  I've used this product for 24 hours and I'm giving up.  What a waste of time and money.

How does this company survive with such a bad product?  

If anyone knows of a good CRM program for a small business, please share.
