iF i COULD, i WOULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS.Caveat emptor! Let the buyer beware. I made the horrible and expensive mistake of buying this the beginning of Feb. 2007. I had to open the box to realize I needed to load it as administrator. That was beyond my limited knowledge. Since it was opened I stupidly believed in their money back guarantee and got a return authorization. It took forever and many calls. They kept on lying on when the refund was mailed. Yes, this went into April 2007!!!!! They insisted the mailing date was April 9th. On the 18th I thought I'd never get it. They stopped payment and maybe issued another. Well, I received the $199 (I am shafted on my state sales tax.) But because those idiots didn't put the name of my street, it apprently was returned and what I got was postmarked April 16th!!!!! And they refuse to rescind the stoppayment. Sooooo...I now need to pray I will ever receive the replacement. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I can't beleive these people sell accounting and contact software
