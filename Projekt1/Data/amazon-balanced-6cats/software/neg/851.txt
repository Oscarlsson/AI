Good grief.  Where do I begin?  We upgraded two computers from 6.0 to ACT 2007.  Prior to the install, we totally reformatted our hardrives and did a clean install of Windows XP.  We performed an XP update, installed MS Office and basically had two smokin' clean machines - more or less brand new.  Then we we installed ACT! 2007 expecting perfection. Our problems with the software have been:

1) Miserable, buggy installation - barely worked.

2) Inability to convert our old ACT 6.0 e-mail database into the new version of ACT 2007. 
 
3) Slow, slow, sloooowwww performance.

4) e-mails will delete themselves for no apparant reason.  This is the worst of all.

5) Terrible syncing with the Palm.  Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, overwrites data when it is not supposed to and vice-versa.

5) Useless Sage tech support.

Don't buy this product.  In fact, I would never buy another product from Sage ever again.  My colleague has already ditched ACT! and switched to using the Palm Desktop and Outlook Express.  This was after losing all his e-mails.  If I lose all my e-mails again - I will uninstall and ditch my copy altogether.

I would love to reclaim the hours of my life lost to this poorly written loser of a program.
