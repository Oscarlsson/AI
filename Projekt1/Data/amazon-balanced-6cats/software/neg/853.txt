It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company.
I have owned this software for about 80 days. 
1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice.
2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes.
3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support'
4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device.

In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them.

Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else
