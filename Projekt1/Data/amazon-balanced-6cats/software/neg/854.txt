I have been a long-time ACT! user. My biggest complaint is recovery. If you have to move the email and database to another computer due to a failure you have to jump through hoops; that's just what one feels like doing when the pressure is on. I still can't bring my ACT! 2007 email over even though ACT! says it was restored successfully (empty folders!). They have a ridiculous technical support team unwilling to help unless you pay, pay and pay and their knowledge base must have been restored like my email: non-existent. The earlier versions were great. I agree with a previous reviewer that when they switched to SQL it all went downhill. I think I'll stick with anything else. It is really ashame. ACT! used to be fast, tight and clean; now it is clunky, lethargic and hangs for 20 seconds on all the time (for some stupid reason) running on an a 2.4 dual core AMD with 4GB memory. Even when Symantec had it they didn't screw it up, but now, you may be better-off sticking with the Palm Pilot contact management software--well, maybe not
