We may never know if we like this product as the Amazon box was empty when it arrived.  We have had no help from amazon, compusa, nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls.  This was my son's Christmas present and he's still waiting... at this rate we'll end up with the opinion that we shouldn't order software online...
