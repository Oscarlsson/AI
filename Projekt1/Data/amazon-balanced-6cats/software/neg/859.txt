I got this as a present about two years ago, and I have had mixed feelings.  I like it, but I get really frustrated because the program is buggy.  I cannot create a standalone executable, and the program has random bugs.  Also, it is very hard to create proffesional-type games.  Be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card, regardless of whether you use it or not.  In conclusion, good idea, but very buggy
