 Microsoft should have done more testing on this product.  This is one mess up product.  I have never seen a version of Microsoft Windows so mess up.  There are so many bugs in this product it is not funny.  I've always been a big Microsoft fan, but I can't endorse this version of Microsoft Windows.  I'm a PC and Console gamer and let me tell you something.  Microsoft Windows Vista does not go with most PC games.  That is very sad.

 Even if Microsoft gave me a free version of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium, I wouldn't take it.  I've read where some Federal Government Agencies won't even use Microsoft Windows Vista because it so mess up and it has so many bugs in it.  I'll stick with Microsoft Windows XP which from what I understand pretty much does all the same things that Microsoft Windows Vista does but without all the bugs in it. Plus you can play any PC game on Microsoft Windows XP.  You can't do that with Microsoft Windows Vista.  I love Microsoft Windows XP.

 Why should anyone waste their time and money upgrading to Microsoft Windows Vista if it doesn't work right?  It is really frustrating because brand new PC games coming out right now and in the future aren't compatible with Microsoft Windows Vista.  If you don't believe me, go into different gaming web sites and read about all the problems people are having playing brand new PC games that just came out with Microsoft Window Vista.  Please Microsoft, fix Microsoft Windows Vista
