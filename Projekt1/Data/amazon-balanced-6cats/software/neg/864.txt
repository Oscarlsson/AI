I think this product is highly overated and this claim
of being 99% accurate is false.
Once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100% accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when
you realise that the very next sentence is complete
gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you
said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted
what you have in that manner.
I think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an American accent may get good results while 
a person with a British or an Australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training.
In summary I think the program is unreliable with an
accuracy of 45% at its present level of developement.
It has plenty of potential and with future developement
 it could much more reliable but at its present level of
developement I think the performance is mediocre.
