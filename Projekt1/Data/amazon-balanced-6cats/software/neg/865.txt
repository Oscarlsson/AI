I will never buy another product from this manufacturer. I have a legal copy of this program, and on the weekend my motherboard died. I had to buy a new board then reinstall all my software, and when I got to DNS8 it told me I'd registered too many times and I had to buy a new copy.
Hidden somewhere in the site I found reference to uninstalling the previous install whilst online to allow me to install it again. So, I dug out my old hard drive, set it up temporarily, connected to the internet and uninstalled. Went to the new machine and installed and ... no dice. Same message.
This is the worst example of product activation, and when I went to customer support they wanted my credit card number in order to charge ME $9.95 to install a legally purchased product. I will now explore other means because I fully intend to use the software I paid a lot of money for.
And in case anyone from the company ever reads this (unlikely), I'm going to use all my online clout to tell people just how annoyed I am. I only get one thousand three hundred unique visitors per day to my websites and blogs, but that adds up to quite a few people over a couple of months and you can be damn sure every one of them will hear about this. I once wrote a lengthy blog post praising your product. Now it's time for the addendum
