G'day, 

I bought DNS 8 Standard to use mainly on trips so I could keep a diary of the trips.

When I tried it, the voice recognition was so-so.  

The worst part was that after about 3 pages the "file" fills up and you have to begin a new one.

Now maybe there is a way around this, but I and no one else will be able to find out from Nuance.  Their customer [dis]service is down at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.  [I could make reference to whale droppings, but that wouldn't be polite.]

I emailed them about this and was told to call for an answer.  However, that would be my one and only free call.

I really think, Nuance needs competition.

Hello there Microsoft
