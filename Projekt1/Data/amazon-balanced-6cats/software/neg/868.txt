This was a huge waste of money. If you have plans to make a custom animation, do not buy this.  Anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters.  You can not change eye color or hair color.  If you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $10- $20.  Their free ones are completly dumb. Using their "easy to use" bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use.  It took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure. (which didn't work very well) You can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version.  I  spent hours trying to use this, and could figure none of the above out.  It also took two weeks to get here instead of four days.  I don't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator.
