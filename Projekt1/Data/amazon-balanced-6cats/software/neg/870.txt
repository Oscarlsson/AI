I have used Turbo Tax for as long as I can remember.  I have always purchased their business and their personal tax products.  Generally I had been satisfied. However this year after spending much time over many months working on a complicated return, Turbo tax dumped all the data including that which was saved many times over several months. It corrupted all but 2kb of data and can't even open that. Of course you can't get a person via telephone or email.  

I would give them o stars if that was an option. So long Intuit
