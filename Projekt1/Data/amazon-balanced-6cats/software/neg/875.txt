Since Tax Cut decided not to produce a Mac version this year, I got stuck with Turbo Tax.  Their website promises that one may import data from the previous year's Tax Cut return.  Then you buy the thing, and you find out that it requires you to load the Turbo Tax program and your 2004 Tax Cut data onto a Windows machine, transfer there, then load it back onto the Mac for this to work.  So, like a chump I borrowed a friend's windows machine and did all this.  But, it doesn't work.  Not at all.  And it takes a lot of time to find that out.  Tried every workaround I could think of.  Nope.  It doesn't work.
