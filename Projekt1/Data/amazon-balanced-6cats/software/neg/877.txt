After purchasing this product, I found there were several problems with scanning. I contacted Nuance (who purchased ScanSoft) to ask for assistance from Technical Support. However, I then learned they want $9.95 for each incident when a request is made by email. Not by phone - by email. After putting out a great deal of money for this product, I should not have to pay $9.95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product. Save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product. I regret that Amazon does not allow me to give this product "0" stars.
