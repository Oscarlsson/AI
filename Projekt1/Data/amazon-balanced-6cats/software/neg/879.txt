If you spend a good deal of your time doing OCR on books skip this program. It is even slower than the previous version (which was tortoise-like) still screws up the order of columns, is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters, Takes forever to move through long documents, and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4. Oh, and don't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms. It will take you less time to create it from scratch in Word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors. I'm switching to Kurzweil
