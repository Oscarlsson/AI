I've used Omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf.  Nothing really fancy, two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables. Using this software was a nightmare.  The OCR worked better than the previous version BUT it showed mixed fonts on the page (two column text w a title about 1/3 down and above the text).  No problem I thought, I'll just use the wysiwyg (what you see if what you get) text editor to fix this..it looks very nice w some good features.  Well, wysiyg is more like wysiwyDON'Tget.  I'd fix the fonts, save the file, open it in adobe reader and find that Omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts/size and the titles.  I tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines (each w text followed by a page number)...no go.  Plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into 'replace text' mode while I was trying to insert text and I couldn't get out.

In frustration I used a friends machine w Abby Finereader 7.0 Pro...what a welcome change.  OCR was at least as fast and accurate and the editor, while not as feature laden as Omnipages, actually worked!  I did in 6 hrs what I'd been trying for well over 12 to do in Omnipage..and that was w/o going thru any of the tutorial info..just loaded it and started.  I'm buying Abby for my next project, they've upgraded to 8.0 and I'll bet it's editor delivers what Omnipage only promises.  I wouldn't recommend Omnipage 15 Pro to anyone
