I bought this to protect my new Dell Axim, a replacement for my Palm Tungsten E (and a step up).  The Axim is wireless enabled so I wanted to protect it.  When I tried to install it, I ran into major issues.  It automatically wanted to install to the Palm (seeing the Palm Desktop software).  There was NO way to override it or choose which device to which it should install.  I contacted Customer Service (an issue in itself) via phone and email.  Emailed response told me to uninstall my Palm software.  How stupid!  I have no intention of uninstalling the Palm just yet.  Meanwhile, trying to PHONE Customer Service was a joke.  I tried a few times, once spending over 60 minutes on hold, another over 90 minutes, with no human contact.  I have a business to run, not plenty of time to waste!  Maybe it works great, but the complications of trying to install prevented me from ever finding out.  Amazon was terrific and let me return the product
