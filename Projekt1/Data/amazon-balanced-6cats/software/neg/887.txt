I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6
