This product is a huge waste of time.  It loaded easily enough, looks friendly, and is feature rich but it just doesn't work !  And support is awful.  Biggest problem is it just would make a good back up image.  Burned many dvd's and the program kept telling me the files were corrupted.  In most cases, I couln't even get confirmation of that.  The program did something to my DVD drive.  It would ask me to swap a spanned set, yet disable my drive !  Process had to be cancelled, whole system rebooted just to get access to my dvd drive again.  When I tried manually checking the files they wouldn't open.  Explore or mounting the images kept requiring a "password".  But I don't use passwords !  Made sure the settings were all password free.  
Stick with Norton Ghost !!!!!
