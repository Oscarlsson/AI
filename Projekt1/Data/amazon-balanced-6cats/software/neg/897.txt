This program has a bug in processing 1099-R data that makes the whole software package useless to me.  After filling in the data from my 2005 1099-R form, the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005, and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return.  I could not find a way overide this problem. Also, there was no apparent way to directly contact H&R Block to find out how to fix it.  After wasting a couple of hours I now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo-tax, which from prior years experience is relatively bug free.
