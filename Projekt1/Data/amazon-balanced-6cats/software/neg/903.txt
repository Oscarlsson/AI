Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan
