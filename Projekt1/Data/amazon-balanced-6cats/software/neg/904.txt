I have been using FrontPage since 1997.  I am webmaster for three websites and have alway really thought this was a great program!  BUT!  I have only upgraded to FrontPage 2000 and find that with my XP computer, Win XP does not support FrontPage.  Now, if I want to continue with my family Genealogy Site and a community Genealogical Society site, I will need to purchase and learn ANOTHER program.  At age 70, I really don't feel like doing that!

Does anyone know if FP 2003 will work on Win XP?  OR  How can I get my FP 2000 to work on my WIN XP computer?
