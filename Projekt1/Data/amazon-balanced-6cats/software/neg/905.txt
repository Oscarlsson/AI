I am not a 'professional,' but figured out how to build a website with this program, which I bought thinking that it was going to help me produce more professional-looking websites/pages, and I invested a bunch of other money in how-to books I'd ordered here, and lo and behold, the server with which I have a website I maintain for my city gov't does NOT support any sites made with this program, and then I find that NEITHER DOES YAHOO where I have my personal site and have been promoting to the city to move their official website to!!!  I've apparently wasted a lot of money and had NO CLUE this would happen when I finally put a website together with this program.  I never would have imagined Yahoo would not support the most current page builders, but it could be they want to force people to use their wizards.  WHY would Microsoft not have a patch available or something to fix this problem so this program can be used for more than just my entertainment spending hours and hours trying to learn it and build something, then find out it was for NOTHING???  Of course, both the server with the city website and Yahoo work with versions up to 2002....but I can't invest another over-$100 for the old version now just for that.  Yeah, it's great....made a pretty page, but only I can see it.  If I could publish with it, I wouldn't have just given it one star here
