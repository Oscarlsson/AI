Have tried about six times to install it.  I've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice, all to no avail.  It says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings.  It tells you to check the log.  Well, there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I don't see any way to correct the errors. When I try to run it I get "starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close".  I'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement
