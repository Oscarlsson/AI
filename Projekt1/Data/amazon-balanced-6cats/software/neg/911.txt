I've been using Quicken for Windows for years.  Since I recently bought a Mac, I thought I'd switch Quicken over from Mac to Windows.  Forget it!  The Mac version is totally incompatible with Windows, you must export your data and then re-import it on the Mac.  This works OK for simple checking / Visa accounts, but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts.  If you look on Quicken's support site, they say "Reinvest Dividend, Reinvest Income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered*"  Hello?!  Like I'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions?  With most major products (Adobe Creative Suite, MS Office), the same files work transparently across Mac and Windows.  Quicken's inability to even import the data, nevermind actually opening it, reeks of incompetence.  Stay away from this product
