I purchased this product thinking that it would revolutionize my financial organization -but I should have known better after I have started to read all of the product reviews.

I can't even give a thorough review, since I can't seem to get past even downloading my savings & checking information from my bank.  The incorrect balances are showing, and the register doesn't show all of the transactions that my banking website shows.  I'm finding that I have to actually check my banking website to cross-check Quicken!  To me, that ain't so quick.

I've just spent over 45 minutes on an online "chat" - which was more of a waste of time than anything.  The customer's support suggestions pretty much entailed deleting files, restarting, deleting files, restarting.

10 minutes ago, he wrote this:
Ashish R.: Thank you.
Ashish R.:  Please  give me 2 minutes only.
Stacey: I think I would just like to return the product...
Stacey: It isn't working...
Stacey: are you still there?
Stacey: Right...
Stacey: Hello?

I'm still sitting here waiting.  I want to return this product - DO NOT BUY!
