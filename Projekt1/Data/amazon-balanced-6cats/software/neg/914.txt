I've been using Quicken for over a decade, and I have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management.  But I had no reason to upgrade from Quicken 2004 until Intuit decided to "break" it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features.  Quicken 2007 for Mac's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version, much less 2005 or 2006, and is certainly inferior to Quicken for Windows.  That's bad enough but Quicken 2007 is also WAY less stable than my prior version (I'm using the R2 update).  It crashes frequently.  Bottom line, Intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market.  I for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there
