I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else.
