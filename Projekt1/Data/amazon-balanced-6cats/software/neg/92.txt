While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.
