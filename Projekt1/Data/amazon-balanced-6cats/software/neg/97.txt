Everything has been said about this product. When it's working, you're happy. With my 8 version, almost everything was fine. With the 10 version, it's a bloody nightmare. I'm giving up, throwing my Dazzle DVC150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my VHS to DVD. NEVER Pinnacle again
