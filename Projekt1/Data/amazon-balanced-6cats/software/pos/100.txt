You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. 
I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. 
I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.
