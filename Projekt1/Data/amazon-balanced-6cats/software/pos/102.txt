I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean
