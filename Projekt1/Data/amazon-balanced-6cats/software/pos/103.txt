I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.
