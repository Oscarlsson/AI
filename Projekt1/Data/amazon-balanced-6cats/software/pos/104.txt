This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.

However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.

I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course
