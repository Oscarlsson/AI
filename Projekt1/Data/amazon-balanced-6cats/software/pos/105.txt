I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.
