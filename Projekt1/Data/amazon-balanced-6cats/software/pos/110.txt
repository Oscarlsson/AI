I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website
