I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!
