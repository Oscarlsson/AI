  My experience with this software as well as the company has been extremely positive. I ordered this program a little over a month ago. When I first received it from Amazon, I was amazed at the shear size of the program. It has a HUGE 1,300 page book with all the images and categories for easy reference. It also comes with 34 CDs that are loaded with images. This software is truly the largest set of art I have ever seen!
  Dealing with Nova Development is as easy to use as their software! When I first opened the box I was a little overwhelmed with the whole thing, so I called tech support. I may have waited a whole 20 seconds before I began speaking with a technician. They walked me through the install and how to use the clip art. They were professional and courteous.
  This software gets an A+ in my book!.
