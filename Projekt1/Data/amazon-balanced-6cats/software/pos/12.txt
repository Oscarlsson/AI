Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!)
