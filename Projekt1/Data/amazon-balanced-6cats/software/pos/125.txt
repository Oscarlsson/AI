I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.
I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine
