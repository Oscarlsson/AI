Not a complicated application, but it successfully repartitioned a 100G drive into 3rds on a new Lenovo laptop with XP SP2.  I would recommend using the DOS version which you can get just by booting on the CD.  Requires no install, you can simply boot, make the changes, and it is done.  Seems to be very straightforward and I would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with Windows running
