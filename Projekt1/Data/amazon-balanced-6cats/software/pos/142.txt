Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast.  Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation;
Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens.  With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer
