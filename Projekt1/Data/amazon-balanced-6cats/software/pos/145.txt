This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! 

There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.

I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.
