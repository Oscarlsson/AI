I was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product -- it's as we we've purchased entirely different programs. In my experience with this software, I've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing, and the card selection and customization is second to none. 

There have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we've customized them countless ways -- adding and editing photos, moving text, sending ecards, you name it! Navigating within the art studio is very intuitive.

Printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great. Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had the problem of having to re-configure every time I print. We set it up once and that was it. I've printed on card stock paper, which turns out gorgeous, and we've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size A2 envelopes (this is a great printing option if you don't want to buy card stock paper!).

I've used this software on all of my computers, have recommended it to many people, and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems. I highly recommend it. It's a fun program, the recipients will love their customized cards, and it will save you money in the long run
