I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past
