I followed all instructions before I attempted to do an upgrade from Windows Me to Windows XP - infact, the more I read the more I was told to do a clean upgrade.  So, I did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and I got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth. I love what it gave me. Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program
