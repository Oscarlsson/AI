I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. 

I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..

Definitely worth the upgrade
