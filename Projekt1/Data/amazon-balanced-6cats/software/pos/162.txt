OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.
OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.
In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.
Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected
