I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD
