I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....
