I'm a longtime Mac user and for re-naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iView Media Pro is the best, I really like the feature that let's you produce and publish on-line galleries of your images, without any code or html experience, using only a very simpe interface and you're ready to go.

For the full-time photographer or amateur, I highly recomend it
