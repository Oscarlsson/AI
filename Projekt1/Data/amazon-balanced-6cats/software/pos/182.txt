I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.
