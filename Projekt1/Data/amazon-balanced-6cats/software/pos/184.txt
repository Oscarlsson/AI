I have been playing the Nancy Drew games for a few years now, and have found that with each one the graphics, intrigue & fun just keep getting better & better.

In "Danger by Design" Nancy agrees to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette's House of Fashion.  He's nervous because Minette had begun acting very strangely & had fallen way behind on her new Spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture.

Once there, Nancy becomes aware of several threatening letters the designer had received, as well as a number of rumors concerning artwork that had been stolen during World War II that may be hidden in the old Wind Mill that now serves as Minette's House of Fashion.  Could they be related some how?

As Nancy Drew, you will find yourself snooping around for clues, working to earn the money needed to buy several needed items, solving various puzzles, and ultimately putting all the information together to solve the mysteries surrounding Minette & the stolen artwork.

Overall, I loved "Danger by Design".  It has the best graphics to date for an ND game & it was great fun to play.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed playing other such games, as well as those who enjoyed (or are enjoying) reading the ND series.
