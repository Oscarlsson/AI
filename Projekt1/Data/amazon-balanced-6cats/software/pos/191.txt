This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.

Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics.

 If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly
