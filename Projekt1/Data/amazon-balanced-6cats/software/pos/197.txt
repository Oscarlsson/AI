I've tried this on two different mac computers: an emac desktop and  an ibook G4, it runs perfectly on both. I see that some people are having problems, I'll see if I can help with that at the end of the review.
I'm a huge x-men fan, but can't afford to buy a bunch of back-issues. The essential book collections are affordable, but they're printed in black & white. With this one disc you get almost 500 uncanny issues, including annuals, all are high-quality scan in's. The disc also has a nice little bio section, and comes with the neccessary adobe software. The one down-side is that you miss out on he tie-in issues, whick gets irritating mid-90's, but I'm not docking a star for that because   what you get is well worth the price, and it's clearly stated in the description that this is strictly "uncanny". 
OK, for those of you having trouble getting it to run w/ a mac here's the process:load cd, click cd image on your desktop twice. You'll get a finder window w/ various files/folders, one will have install on it, this should be the adobe software, follow the installation instructions, and move your new adobe reader to applications when finished, restart your computer. Once re-started load the cd again, open adobe reader 6.0 click the folder image in the upper left-hand corner you should have a finder-type window, go to desktop, click on x-men and choose start.pdf. You should be good to go. HT
