Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.
