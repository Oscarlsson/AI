I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.
I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.
