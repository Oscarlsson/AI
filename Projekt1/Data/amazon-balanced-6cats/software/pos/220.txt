i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .
