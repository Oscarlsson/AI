This is a good package for backing up your PC.  Fairly intuitive, although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so I could select the right stuff to backup.  It uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup.  The downside of that is you can't just select a file to restore, you must go through the restore process.  You can select a single file, but it takes a bit of time.  Runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won't interfere with your current work.
