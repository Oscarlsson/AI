I had access to the CD version of this product that came with the Image Library Catalog in the box. I liked using it and although there was a lot of CD disc-trading with 34 discs, it worked well for me. I could usually go to the disc I wanted on the first attempt.

Later, I wanted to add this collection to my home office and went back to the same store where the original version was bought. They had sent back all the CD editions where the image catalog was included in the box and replaced them with the DVD edition that is only 5 discs and you have to send off for the catalog for the low low price of shipping ($4.95). Whenever I go to use the DVD's, I have to wait a long time for the dics to load into memory and almost forever if I request the thumbnail versions to come up in the browser.

I would rather switch discs any day then spend my time staring at the monitor while waiting for the computer to load my information. The store involved is happy because they are using less box space on the shelf (or so the stock personnel said). I am unhappy at having to send off for the manual that says it's included on the box but isn't, the extra money for the shipping, and the awkwardness to use this 'upgraded' product
