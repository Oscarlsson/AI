I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked.
