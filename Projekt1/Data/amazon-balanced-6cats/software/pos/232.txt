   I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished!      
   Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do.
