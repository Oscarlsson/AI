...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.

The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. 

Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.

If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did
