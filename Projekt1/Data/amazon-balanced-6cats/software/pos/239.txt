This is by far my favourite HER Interactive Nancy Drew PC game, and I have played them all multiple times. I loved the food aspect of it [my sister's a chef], in the cafe where you could gyp the game into letting Nancy have a muffin or a bowl of delicious New England clam chowder anytime you wanted to making a sandwich for Katie; AND calling Bess and George to hear how Bess is learning to cook from a TV show and hearing her worry about what she's making.

The puzzles were not nearly as difficult as some more recent games make them; they were challenging but doable, took some moving about and kept the game adventurous. The bike riding was inventive, rather than a train or car or what have you, and I loved being down by the lighthouse, near the water.

I believe it is one of HER Interactive's best games so far and is the best bet for a Nancy Drew gamer
