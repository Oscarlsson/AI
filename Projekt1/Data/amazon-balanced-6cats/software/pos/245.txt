If you have used MS Streets & Trips, then you'll know your way around AutoRoute.  We are using this to plan a trip to Europe next May.  Based on my knowledge of locations in Britian, the software appears to be pretty accurate.  If you want to use this with a GPS that does not come bundled with the package, expect some frustration.  I still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my USB based Garmin unit.  I think it is possible, just do not know how.
