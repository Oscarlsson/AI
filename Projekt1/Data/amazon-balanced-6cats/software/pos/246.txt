As far as GPS software goes, there is nothing better available than Streets & Trips and AutoRoute.  There are dozens of features that you can't find with the self-contained GPS units.  It is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order, night-view is another great feature, as are the topographical maps.  The new feature offered this year, of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map, is also a welcome addition.  

The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the following:

1)  There is STILL no ground-level or 3D view of the roads for use in the GPS function

2)  They still haven't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them.

3)  There isn't a lot of coverage for Eastern European countries, most notably, nothing in Russia.

Nonetheless, it is still better than any other GPS software on the market
