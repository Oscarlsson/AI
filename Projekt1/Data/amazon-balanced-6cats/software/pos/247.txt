Easy to install and get started.  I purchased it to manage my digital photo's and not to do sophisticated picture editing or enhancements for publishing.  It's been easy to use for my purposes.  If you are planning on doing professional level editing or graphic manipulation, do more homework on the robustness of this product.  I can't comment on it's capabilities for that purpose
