For those already familiar, I was excited about this edition when it was advertised that it now works with RAW files.  This one of the advantages that Adobe Photoshop Elements has.  I have a Nikon Digital SLR and I often shoot in RAW and have to convert to .jpg if I want to edit with Microsoft Digital Imaging.  When I went out to buy this "Anniversary" edition, in very small print it reads that it's the same as the previous 2006 edition "except" support for RAW files is no longer included.  Still, it was on sale ($24) and I thought an upgrade would be cool.  When I used it, I saw little or no difference in this than the Microsoft Digital Image 10 I had already been using.  In my opinion, upgrading from 10 isn't worth it. 

For those new to this product, let me start by saying, I've been a long time user of Microsoft's digital imaging products.  I enjoy the bright, clean look of the interface.  More that that, I love how simple it is to use.  I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image to all skill levels, but especially anyone who's just starting out in Digital Photography and computers.  Hands down, it's the easiest.  It does in one step what would take three Photoshop Elements.  You sacrifice come control, but simplicity is the focus of this program.  Adobe Photoshop Elements is more powerful, but harder to use.  Bottom line is, if you want to concentrate on getting out and taking good pictures instead of spending lots of time editing, get Microsoft Digital Imaging.  For the average shutterbug, It'll edit just as good as Photoshop Elements in less time and for less money.
