Learn Catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base; however, i have taken about 5 years of Spanish and found the CD to be fairly basic, and while catalan differs in many ways, many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope.   There are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist.   I definitely have benefitted from this CD because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it.  Overall, great for beginners, and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge
