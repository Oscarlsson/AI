Remember....this is a software program and may require you to purchase appropriate hardware to compliment!

PRO's: Easy to install, somewhat intuitive to use. Up and running in no time. Imports Digital Video fairly simply. Speed of production is directly related to your equipped home computer. Stability of program is strong point. Does what it says it can do. Didn't make any coaster on first attempts to use. Finish product runs well on all DVD players.

CON's: Needs more style templates. Needs an imbedded sound translator for music track imports. Steeper then normal learning curve with less then optimum manual explanations
