I've only just begun using this software, but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow. I would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials. I find the tutorial confusing. So far I have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the Help section, but it just isn't as straight forward as I would have liked. I purchased this b/c it was rated so high by PC Magazine. I'm sure in time I'll learn the software better, but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware I have taught myself to use.
