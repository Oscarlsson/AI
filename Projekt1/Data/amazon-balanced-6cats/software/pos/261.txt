Simple and Great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user. I would say it is the beginner to Intermediate user tool. I can really create fast movies very quickly. 

Pros:
Easy to install
Easy to split/edit Home videos
Compatible with iLink
Support for High Definition HDV Camcorders
Competitive price

Cons: 
User Interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows.

Rendering is slow.
