I was a little skeptical about this program  - until I tried it last evening for the first time. I am really impressed.....  I did not even use the tutorial before I dove in and tried to play a bit.  I created a single room in less than 3 minutes, using simple walls, doors, windows, and a fireplace.  Adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful!  LOL

I am most anxious to do more with the program and learn about all its capabilities.  Today I watched the tutorial and was really surprised at how much this program can do!  

I am entering into an interior design program in January 06 and wanted to "play" with the CAD software in advance.  I was really happy and impressed with the simplicity of the Better Homes and Gardens version as the idea of CAD seemed intimidating.  Not any more....

I whole-heartedly recommend this program to everyone who is considering designing their interiors or for students of interior design who have not yet attempted any CAD programs.
