Impressed with the way it clears out viruses, spyware, and Trojans---I can look at what it's doing or just let it do it. That all goes well. What I don't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and I can't figure how to change this. So the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful
