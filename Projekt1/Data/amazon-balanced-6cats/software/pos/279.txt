I am not a computer geek or techie at all, most software and hardware changes always make me hold my breath and cross my fingers.  I recently purchased the Kaspersky Anti Virus based on the review of it in Consumers Reports.  It installed easily, updates automatically and frequently.  Very satisfied with it.
