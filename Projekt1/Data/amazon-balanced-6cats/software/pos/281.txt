This is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for I have several Immaging programs that I use for several different things. This one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user. Its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use. However you do have to be some what computer savy, (like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks. I would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program. Its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it
