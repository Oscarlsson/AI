Not sure how I got it, but I got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot wouldn't get rid of.  On top of that I got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid of.  So out of desperation to do something quickly, I went to B.Buy and bought this for $40.  They didn't have a large selection, so I put down the money for it.  Imagine my  feeling when I saw it on amazon for $20.  Still this product works well.  It made me uninstall spybot, adaware, and  turn off my windows firewall to install it.  You can install it on 3 different computers, or it asked you to switch your license from one of them, should you install it a fourth time.  So you can install it more than 3 times, you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand?  Product works very well and got rid of my problems.  You get updates for 1 year, and then you have to renew.  I think this is stupid personally, but its the Trend now days.  Its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year.  Several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what I want it to do.  I wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it.  The firewall slows down your connection, but they all do.  I have 3MG DSL and my speed test are down around 1300K, so I've lost alot of bandwith.  I guess its worth the protection.  Before with spybot and adaware, the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware.  Now with Trend Micro, I find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan.  So I'm happy with the product, except for my decrease in DSL speed
