I have been using PC-Cillin after dumping McAfee following some lousy customer support with no issues. This new version I was very concerned after reading all of the reviews. It does seem to slow things a little on my AMD PC if I am running all of the options I can run but even with them it is tolerable. I am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple.
