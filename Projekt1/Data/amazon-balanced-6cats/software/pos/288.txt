Switched from Panda Anti-Virus to this one.  Great software, very sensitive settings.  It was quite aggrevating at first getting constantly interrupted in other programs to be told of various things going on.  Finally got each feature individually adjusted to settings I can live with, and it works great.  They could improve the filtration time (long) to analyze your computer (I only have a 40gig HD with about 20gig used) as it takes about 20-25 mins. to do the complete cleansing process.  However, first time I ran it after having run Panda for the last time, it caught 2 undetected trojans Panda missed.  It also isolated a hidden file trying to access the internet for "updates" that I still have not been able to identify, but it's zapped.  Overall, best I've seen so far, and you can install it on up to 3 computers from one cd (just name each installation with a different username to accomplish, all perfectly legal with the 3 User CD deal).  I have 3 laptops covered at a cost of about $13 each - I'll take that all day long
