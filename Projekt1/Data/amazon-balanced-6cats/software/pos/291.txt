My feelings are...if you have simple income, not a lot of financial dealings, this program will walk you thru your returns with no difficulty. I've only done Fed & State with 2 incomes, 1 home, with all the associated deductions and the program handled everything. Using the program is a snap and it saves me about $200-300 over using a tax preparer, who asks me questions just like this program does. You simply need to sort out all your receipts, etc., the same as you need to do for a live preparer
