I love Toast, and have had it since version 3.  Don't have TiVO, so can't comment on usability, but for everything else it works better than software that comes with Mac.  Can't wait to try double-density and Blu-Ray, with which this is compatible.  Even earlier versions could burn more different kinds of media than the burn software that came with the Mac.  A friend of mine just switched from PC to Mac, and this was the first software that I suggested he buy.  As another reviewer said, if you have Toast, you don't need Popcorn.  The best!!
