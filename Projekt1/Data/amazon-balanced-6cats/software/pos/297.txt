I was a little leary about purchasing this product, having never tried anything like it before and being fairly new to the computer world.  I was delighted to find how easily the Toast 8 system worked for me.  The owner's manual is VERY specific, and while I am still discovering all the capabilities of this software, I have found it to be extremely useful.  I recommend this product very highly
