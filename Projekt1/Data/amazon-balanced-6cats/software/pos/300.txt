This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else
