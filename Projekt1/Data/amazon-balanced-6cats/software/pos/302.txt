I purchased Elements because frankly,I couldn't afford the whole big Adobe enchilada.I have found it to be pretty intuitive.Lots and lots of options as to organization,photo-tweaking and such. I have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos.
I do have two other imaging programs,and with the addition of Elements,I feel like I'm basically well-set with zillions of options.Plus,there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography,and they supply free downloads of Photoshop samples, such as "textures," and so on.Very helpful.
Get this if you can't spring for the complete Photoshop program. You will not be disappointed
