I wanted to see if I could do all the essential digital image editing "on the cheap" in PSE5...and I am satisfied that I have been able to do just that.

The best companion book I've seen to assist in that effort is this one:
Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Maximum Performance: Unleash the Hidden Performance of Elements by Mark Galer.
 
The combination of the PSE5 software and book proved to be perfect for me, and as near as I can tell, I can now do all the image editing I need to do, at a fraction of the cost and time required for the full-on Photoshop product. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. If you're on the fence about it, I'd recommend downloading the 30 day trial version from the Adobe website prior to purchasing
