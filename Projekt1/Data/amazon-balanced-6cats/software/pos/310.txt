OK, it is big (4 CDRs).  And a full install will require over 2.35 GB.  But it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card.  

As in previous years, it also installs Event Planner. If you don't want to use Event Planner you can stop it from starting with Windows by going to START / ALL PROGRAMS / Startup group and deleting the entry for Event Planner from the STARTUP group but if you don't have a similar program, you might find Event Planner to be useful.

I found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing Ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do, so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also. 

The quality of the printed cards is really astounding, even my normally "picky" wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use. I suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures, then the cards should turn out very nice. I recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product. 

Cards that default to printing out in the 1/4 sheet size (four fold) format can easily be printed at 1/2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding. 

I never experimented with the "partial install" that would require disk swapping but save HD space, so I cannot if that would be a nuisance or not.  

Overall, there is nothing I've found about the program that I don't like.
