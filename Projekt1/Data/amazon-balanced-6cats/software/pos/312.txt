I have used WordPerfect and Quattro almost from their inception, so I have seen both of them improve over many years. Those years of practise have resulted in WordPerfect Office X3, a really outstanding product.

Because many other organizations and people that I work with use MS Word and MS Excel, in the past I have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response. Now, however, WordPerfect and QuatroPro can translate Word and Excel, incoming and outgoing. Therefore, I no longer have to maintain two Office programs. 

Many years of using WP Office have probably prejudiced me, but I find it more user friendly than MS Office; however, the biggest difference is that Corel is responsive and helpful whereas MS is almost impossible to deal with
