I like WordPerfect much better than Microsoft Word as it is easier to use.  Reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave. Not available in Word. I bought the X3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12., like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems. The price was right on Amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12. I don't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that I was having in 12. If an earlier version is working for you, I see no good reason to upgrade.
