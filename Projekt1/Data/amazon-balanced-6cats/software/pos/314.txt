I installed it on three of my computers with no problem I have used wordperfect before and it's vey user friendly. I'm not a power user but the basic things seen be easier to do. I recomended. The software came with and intructional  dvd no how to used un like the microsoft counter part.
this software is more then what is needed for the average person. it also comes with some free download for installing the software in your computer which you can install on all three computers. it come with lots of template that you can used.
