I've always preferred WordPerfect to Word.  I find it is easier to use, more intuitive, and allows more control over documents.  It is less buggy, and I have yet to find one thing that Word does better than WP.  This new version of WP is even better than the old, and I can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from Word.  

Word users should find this version especially easy to switch to, since it can be made to look and act like Word (though why anyone would want that, I don't know).  Underneath the surface, though, it is still WP, which means it is stable, you can see codes in your document and manipulate them, and it won't do things like decide when you put a number somewhere that you are making a list and start indenting and doing other weird things you don't want and can't control.  

I have been using WPX3 heavily since I got it, but I still haven't used all the features.  I am especially looking forward to trying its PDF conversion function.  I also haven't used any of the other programs in the suite yet, but if prior versions are any indicator, they will also be easy to use and powerful.
