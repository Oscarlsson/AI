A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
