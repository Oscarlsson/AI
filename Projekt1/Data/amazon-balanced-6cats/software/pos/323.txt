I have been using FrontPage 2003 and decided that Web Expression Web was the next stage in my website building hobby.  It was easy to install, and I can still use FrontPage 2003 on my existing websites. No need for FrontPage extensions which will be a plus on one of the server hosts I use.  Also bought "Using Microsoft Expression Web" by Jim Cheshire. An excellent book.  Still have much to learn, but looks like fun
