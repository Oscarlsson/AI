The only problem that I had,was loading the actual program on the three computers that I have.You had to delete your old Norton AntiVirus 2006 before starting.Also I have one more problem that after I loaded the Norton AntiVirus 2007 - 3 Users on the last computer I still get a error that I need to down load the latest updates,which I already did
