I do television editing for my church and I dabble alittle at home. I have many editing programs that I use for music and video editing of home movies from cams and 8mm.I had nero 6 and it was ok, but nero7 ultra (enhanced) has taken the place of all the other programs. It is my primary editing suite for music and videos. for music I can make changes to songs for skating programs where I would have to send out to have words removed or create a cd for pleasure.This program is remarkable, there are still somethings I have not yet used, this was the best but in this type of program for under $800.00 that is how much the programs that we use in the studio starting price is. Buying this program will be a great investment.
