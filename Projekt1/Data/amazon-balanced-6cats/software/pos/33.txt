I upgraded from Version 5. I don't use very many of the features. But the big difference I see is, files sizes seem to be greatly reduced. Something I would scan and be 10mb, now might be 2mb. This is just opinion, nothing scientific. The interface takes some getting used to, a bit different. Overall for the price ($99 - Less $20 Rebate), a great deal
