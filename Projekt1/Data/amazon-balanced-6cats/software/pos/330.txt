I previously had Nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me. I upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when I upgraded my computer to Vista premium, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I have tried so far has been flawless.
It seems that different systems have different results with Nero. For example some people say Nero 6 works best for them, but on my old system it was horrible (running on win2k).
It's complicated software though, so people should give Nero a break.
Overall they do a great job. Just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system.
