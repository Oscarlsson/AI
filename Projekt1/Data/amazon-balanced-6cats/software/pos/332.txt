I used this unit to calibrate my Mitsubishi WD65732 DLP HD TV and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment. I first went through the tv manual to make sure I understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so I could study them and make sure I knew how the language related to the SpyderTV adjustment language. Once I did that and marked down the adjustment ranges, it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments. It even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons. Some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising, but the bottom line is that the picture looks great
