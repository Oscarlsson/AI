After going insane with the new version of Norton Systemworks 2005, which doesn't even install, I decided to finally swear off all Symantec products. 

I have used Zone Alarm Pro for some time. It's not perfect, but it certainly will protect your computer. I took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week, and I've been relatively happy.

On the plus side, the software works really well. The personal firewall is better than any you can find, and the virus protection found a phishing app that Norton had not (before I had unstalled it).

On the minus side, the firewall can be problematic. I've had page load issues on Ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked (bandwidth theft). When I visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script, the images simply won't come up. Ebay gets all messed up as well. I haven't been able to figure out a setting that works, so I have to turn off the firewall on Ebay and a few other sites, which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall. This doesn't happen a lot though, so it's not annoying enough to get my dander up.

All in all it's been a far better investment than Symantec products, so despite its limitations I would recommend this program. It does have a lot of options to set, but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate.

If you decide to go with this program and you currently have Norton Antivirus, you will need to uninstall Norton before this program will run.

If you were to ask me if I preferred Symantec Systemworks or Zone Alarm Security Suite, there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending Zone Alarm.
