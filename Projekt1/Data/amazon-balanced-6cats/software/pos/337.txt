Between high school and college I have studied French for three years and I had been convinced that I would starve to death in Paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood.  Much of that has changed not that I am half way through the Rosetta Stone program.  My ear is now tuned to the language. I have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses.  My vocabulary still needs to get stronger, but now that I can distinguish individual words in a stream of French, that is only a matter of practice with the language.  As advertised, this program is painless and progress is rapid.  Try the demo, you'll see.
