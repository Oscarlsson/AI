The immersion process is the only one that works, and this product is a first rate immerser, making the study painless, even immensely pleasurable as one realizes he/she is coming to "own" a new language and perspective. In working with students it is the best "head start" method that I know of, comparable to one-on-one study for at least a year with an accomplished tutor. Unlike less effective methods, it quickly achieves the essential purpose of deeply internalizing the language if one does each of the processes thoroughly. Of course continued study, especially in acquiring vocabulary, is necessary, just as it is for those acquiring a native language - the study of any language is ongoing.

I would give this program 50 stars if that option were available.
