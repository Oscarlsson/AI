Overall I would highly recommend the Rosetta Stone software even though it's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method.  Rosetta Stone *combined* with Pimsleur is a great method for languages that are similar to your native language.  The disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the CD in the drive any time you are going to use it and you can't use a backup copy for safety.

The Rosetta Stone lessons are quick, easy and fun to do, thus encouraging usage.  If you can afford it I would definitely recommend combining Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone.  Both are excellent products and far better than less expensive products commonly available.  But neither alone is sufficient for effective learning of a language.

Could Rosetta Stone be improved?  Certainly.  More diverse and better graphics would help.  The graphics they use are very good but occasionally a picture isn't quite clear as to meaning.  For example if you are supposed to select "a boy on a horse" you may not realize it is a boy on the horse.

If you are questioning if you should get Rosetta Stone or not, just get a free demo CD from their website and try it yourself.  As far as I can tell the full product is exactly the same as the demo but obviously you have access to more lessons
