I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking. 
The only negative is that the CD has to be used to run the program. Even with an accelerated CD-Rom, the starting/stopping of the CD is distracting. If that feature were corrected, it would be perfect
