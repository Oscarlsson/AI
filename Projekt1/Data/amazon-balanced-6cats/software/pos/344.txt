Overall I was pleased with ease of installation. This was an upgrade from Office 2003. I backed up all files before upgrade, and always do this, but it was not necessary for this upgrade. My overall disappointment is Outlook's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers (yahoo, gmail, etc.). The shift appears to favor msn products only (hotmail and msn). No wonder Thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application
