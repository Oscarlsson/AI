It seems the last few Office releases I have purchased haven't really offered anything different, but this one does.  The interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to.  I would suggest upgrading to Office 2007 when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project.  The new toolbars seem to be really thought out and are very user friendly.  If you aren't into change and prefer the status quo of the standard, File Edit Tools...layout, then this product is not for you.  If you are willing to spend a couple hours getting used the new layout (it's quite easy) you won't be sorry because it's well worth it.
