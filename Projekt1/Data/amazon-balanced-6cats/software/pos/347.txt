Office 2007 is a nice step up from Office 2003 (and earlier) as it has better visuals on the toolbar. e.g. Instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands, i.e. File, Tools, Edit, etc, you'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar. When clicking on the tabs, it sets up across the toolbar, all of the functions of that particular tab. Once viewed, you not only see the words of the functions, but also, small example graphs and images of what that functions does. This only applies to all the applications other than Outlook, which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003

The load times seem to be much quicker than what I had in the 2003 version. In Outlook, setting up accounts, maintaining names and addresses is much easier too. The only annoying part of Office 2007 that comes to mind is, one can only choose from 3 color schemes. The three are "Black" which really looks more like a dark taupe or slate color, "Blue" which looks more like a light powder blue and "Silver", which looks like a light gray. In my honest opinion, I like having the standard color look like previous versions and as my taste goes with this, I only like the black setup only
