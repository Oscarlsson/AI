I bought this for my god-daughter after buying Mia's Science Adventure. I have never been so impressed with a companies product before. You can learn both Spanish AND French on the same CD. The graphics are amazing, the adventure is stupendous and now Lily (my god-daughter) is learning Spanish. Her level is above all her classmates and she's even started conversing with a Mexican girl in our neighbourhood. Well worth your money
