This game is great!  After buying Mia Reading I thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning Spanish since we live in a global village. They game was easy to load, easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners. The high quality 3D animation will blow you away. Even my husband who learned 3D animation at the Vancouver Film School was blown away. The best part is, that they love playing it as they think it is a game. They forget they're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences. Well recommended
