I have had this only a couple of days and have learned it quickly thanks to the training CD that is included with the program.

Very easy to learn. Great item.

I have used this program every day and must say I love it. I have used other photo editing software and did not like them much. This is so easy to use, the training CD gets you started and after compleing it (7 chapters) you are ready to fix all the photos you like but are over or under exposed. A powerful program. You can look like a pro using this. 10 stars if I could
