Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one.  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down!  While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons.  I was impressed!  The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed.   I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results.  So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.
