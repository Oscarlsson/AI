This photo editing software package is unreal.  It has more features and functions than you can shake a stick at.  Right out of the box I began some serious photo editing and got outstanding results.  Beats any other software in it's price range.  I have yet to read the manual or instructions as it intuitive.  Two things - don't even bother with the free version of Snapfire, which is included.  It is redundant with Pro Photo and rather simplistic without much value.  It is included as a teaser to get you to spend more money with Corel by way of an upgraded version.  And unfortunately the software is NOT well behaved and crashes to frequently.  If it were not for this stability issue I would have given it a (5) star rating.  Corel - nice job but get it working better
