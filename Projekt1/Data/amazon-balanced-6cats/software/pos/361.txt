I used Paint Shop Pro to help build my website. I really like it and I'm glad I bought it. My favorite part about it is the animation software. You can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects. Because of PSP 9 my website now has animation, buttons and a banner with bright colors and images! I love it! And anyone can use it! I had no experience with PSP or computer art and graphics, but this is pretty simple to use.

Also you can use PSP for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs. This is great software for doing all this stuff and it's so much cheaper than Photoshop. If you're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work, then maybe you want to check out Paint Shop Pro
