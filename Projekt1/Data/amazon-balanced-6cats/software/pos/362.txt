This is truly the killer application for comic book collectors.  You get the comic's whole run from its auspicious origins in 1961 to its current incarnation at the end of 2004, in a tiny DVD that you can carry anywhere.  The thrill of reading classical issues in all their colored glory is not to be missed, particularly for those not reprinted so far.  I especially enjoyed the Impossible Man and Molecule Man origin stories.  Seeing how particular adventures ended is also great fun, since I owned some comics from the generally undistinguished 1980s, but didn't know how things turned out.  Being able to read the entire John Byrne run of the mid-eighties was spectacular.  It's even better than his work at the X-Men, and almost as cool as the Lee-Kirby years.  This is so much better than the Essentials, since it's in color and so much cheaper, plus it includes the original ads and letter pages.  It also beats the Masterworks series not only on account of price, but also because it has the original colors.  It's as good as owning the complete collection, but it will take up less space and hence will generate less nagging from mothers or wives.  This is a must have item, with perhaps the best price/quality ratio I have ever seen.  Can it be improved?  Sure.  Why not take advantage of the possibilities of computers and create an index of all characters that would allow the reader to see all appearances of a character over the years? Why not create an index of writers and artists, so that one may quickly get a view of their work?  Cross-referencing is the next step the good people at Marvel must be working on.  But there's no reason to wait for that.  Even as it is, this DVD is not just good enough.  It is great, like the Fantastic Four themselves
