It is user friendly, transparent, and more robust than Trendmicro's or CA's products, both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working.  For Windows OSes, Onecare is best in my experience.  However, I have not used OneCare's backup feature enough to make  a judgement.  The $49.99 for 3 computers may be okay, but it would be even better if Microsoft offers it for one computer at  1/3 the rate, say at $17/computer per year
