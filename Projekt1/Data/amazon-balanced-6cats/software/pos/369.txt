wow, this really made a difference in my ability to create professional-looking comics. i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is  really good. i think my favorite feature is the tool for making Panels. Plus the tool for doing special effects lines, which is pretty sweet.

i just draw comics for fun, and for this price it is totally worth it. Manga Studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings.

I would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga
