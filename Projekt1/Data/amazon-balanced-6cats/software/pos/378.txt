I've used PaperPort 9 for about 3 years, currently running under Win XP. I love it, my wife loves it, I have bought it for my kids, and recommend it to others. A lawyer friend of mine raves about it. I've had no problems with it. (I had to  downlaod and install an upgrade, but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated.) I download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the Internet; I store faxed documents in it; I scan checks before I deposit them; I use it to convert documents to pdf so I can e-mail them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things; maybe V. 10 adds those features, but for the money, V.9 is a bargain. I just wish I had a faster scanner (what do you expect for $60?) so I could get rid of more paper documents. Highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office
