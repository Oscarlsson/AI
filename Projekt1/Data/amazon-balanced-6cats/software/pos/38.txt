&#65279;Sandra; hope you get to read this before giving up on this great little program.
Check your printer drivers and spooler.  I'm as close to a computer guru as you'd want having
played with computers in general and PC's in particular since the heady early days of Sinclair,
Kildall, and Adam Osborne.  Installed Hallmark Card Studio on my beloved's machine several
years back.  Was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner - my
lady took to it immediately - and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user (only wish
could import export data to other address books, and wouldn't it be great to have a Palm
conduit?!-)(I digress!-).
Every new version just gets better to the point 2004 has close to two gigs of cards and imagery.
In short, Sandra Hallmark Card Studio 2004 IS A KEEPER.

Now, approve of your using 98SE, I recommend to my students (yes I teach computing) not to go
beyond 98SE and certainly not to connect anything from MS to the InterNet beyond 98SE (little
thing code name of Palladium!-(
There can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool32.  Try removing your
printer under START &#62;SETTINGS &#62;PRINTERS, restart your computer with the printer on and
reinstall.  Hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program.  HB
