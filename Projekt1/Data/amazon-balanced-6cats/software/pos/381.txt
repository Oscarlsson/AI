It's amazing having the entire history of a comic series at your disposal.  In print format, it would be impossible for most people to own, let alone store, this much comic book history.  You have to adjust to looking at the comics on the screen, rather than holding it in your hands (a large monitor helps), but other than that I highly recommend this entire series of digitized comics.

To be able to go back in time and see how the comics reflect the times, whether they be in the 60's, 70's or more recent years, really shows you how closely comic books reflect pop culture
