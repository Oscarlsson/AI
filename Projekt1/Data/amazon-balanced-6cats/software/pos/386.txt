Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them . I do have them on my laptop so I guess that kinda works. Whats great about it is the price. 30 bucks for 40 years of comics.....get real!!! I did have some install problems at first like others have but when I took the disc out and reloaded it it fixed itself. I think it was a Adobe update but it did it for me so no biggie. My only problem now is when am I going to find time to read all of the issues. Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics
