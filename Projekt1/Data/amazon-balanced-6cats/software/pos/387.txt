We bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year's old sun to learn how to play because I didn't know how to play and I couldn't teach him. As a result of this purchase 

1) My sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that I couldn't imagine

2) I (his mom) learned how to play too.
It is so much fun to learn it that I would recommend it to anybody. It worth it every penny I spent. I like everything about this game. Kids will love it 100%.
