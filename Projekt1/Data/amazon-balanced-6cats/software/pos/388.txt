We purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months.  While I have been able to get them started, I find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow.

Both kids enjoy using this software and, if I would let them, would spend hours at a time using the software.

My biggest issue with the software is the  sound and animation.  We continually have issues with the sound/animation not being in sync or the audio cutting in and out.  We run this on a computer with plenty of processing power, memory, disk space, etc.  It does not bother this kids too much, but I find it annoying.

All in all, a great tool to help my children learn the game.
