This is my first review but I just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program. I bought this game when my children were in Kindergarten and second grade. Fritz and Chester's program is so engaging. There are rhymes and chants for each piece's moves as well as for some other "strategy-type" moves. For example, "A knight on the rim is ugly and dim." What a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play! This program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies. I would recommend getting Fritz and Chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play! My boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade. Their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments. Fritz and Chester 2 is also great and my boys, now in third and sixth grade, still play it
