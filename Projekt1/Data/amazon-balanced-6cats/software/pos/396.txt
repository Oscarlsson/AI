I bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great! My screen broke on my nokia 6102, and i ended up buying a razor. I had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me. Transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes. Also, the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone.
