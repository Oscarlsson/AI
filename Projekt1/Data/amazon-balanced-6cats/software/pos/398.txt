The software is easy to install and easy to use.  The "import prior year's return" feature saved time in completing multiple returns .  I completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature. I also discovered the "save as PDF" feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom I prepare returns.  I have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year. The premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules
