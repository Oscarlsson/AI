This Bible is wonderful! It's written in language that is easy to understand. Many people give up on trying to study the Bible because the language is so different from the way we speak now. You won't have that problem with the New Living Translation, and the notes are so helpful. Whenever I'm unclear about a verse or the context, I check the notes, and usually they help me to understand the meaning. They also help me to understand traditions of the time and meanings that were implied to the readers of the time. Whether you've been a Christian for 50 years, or you're only thinking of trying to read the Bible for the first time, or you're anywhere in between, this Bible is a great choice
