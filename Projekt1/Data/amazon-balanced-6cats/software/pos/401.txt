I'm just learning, and this bible is wonderful. It's written in language I can understand (much easier than the King James version), and the commentary brings everything into focus. 
There is so much extra information in this book and the commenters really took care to try to explain so a newbie like me could understand.
The book comes with a concordence also, which is a God-send (sorry about the pun). I've been so engrossed in reading that I haven't even looked at the CD-ROM yet, but I'm sure it will have great information also.
If you want an easy-to-read bible that comes with fantastic study material, this is the right book for you
