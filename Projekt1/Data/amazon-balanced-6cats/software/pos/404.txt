This is a well done operating system I use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems. All my hardware has 64bit drivers. Overall this is a good product and I would buy it again. Because I went from a 32bit O/S to a 64bit O/S I had to boot from the DVD to install it, but I was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did I have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do
