I use Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime I'm traveling to a destination where I'm not absolutely certain how to get there.  In general, I'm pleased with it's performance.  It has saved me from wrong turns many times.  However, the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions.  GPS tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant "Off Route" - "Back on Route" messages as you navigate twists and turns.  I suspect, in that case,  the map data is just not that accurate
