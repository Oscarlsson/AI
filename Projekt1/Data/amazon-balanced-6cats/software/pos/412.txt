Don't listen to the whinnier. If you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills, this helps. You must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money. It is worth the effort! I noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work. I also purchased the music CD's produced by the same company. They are helpful as well. I use them at work, at home, and in the car. The Brain Builder Booklet mentions the CD's. If you want to stop looking stupid because you can't remember information or you're tired of getting lost while driving, this will help you
