I don't write reviews often but this product is so great I had to share my thoughts on it.  I bought this product because I was going back to graduate school(mechanical engineering so please excuse my grammar) and I wanted an extra boost in brain power.  I have been using this product just about everyday for weeks now and the results are very apparent.  I have noticed two obvious improvements in myself.  

First, I can now navigate a city with ease.  I always knew my short term memory was the limiting factor in my navigation abilities.  Before I'd always forget where I came from, left or right,what street Im on, etc.  I always had people correct me.  Now I am the one leading and its not because I am paying more attention.  Without directly thinking of my orientation I just know where to orient myself(My gf would always correct me, but now Im correcting her).   

The second obvious improvement is my improved speech and listening abilities.  I'd always have trouble fumbling in my speech and understanding people.  But now I feel I can think of what to say more quickly and clearly.  

I have been doing many puzzles this past summer and the combination of that and brain builder really changed my life.  I think more clearly and I can think "better" now. Hard to explain but the "fog has been lifted".  Everything is easier now whether its putting something together or understanding the environment around me.  Also my IQ scores appear to shoot up really high but thats up to debate.   

I just want to say what a great product this is and I highly recommend it to anyone.  Im sure when I start school this fall I'll see a leap in my abilities.
