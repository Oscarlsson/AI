Brain Builder is a series of visual and auditory exercises aimed at improving attention, concentration and memory. This consists of seven exercises, one involving visual reaction speed and accuracy and six memorizing a sting of randomly generated numbers presented audiably or visually in one of three modes--BASE (straightforward) REVERSE (you must give back the string in reverse the order given) and FLASH (visual numbers presented one at a time instead of all at once like BASE) or RANDOM (auditory where you cope with numbers being read at an uneven pace). You are then immediately tested by having to type in what those were. There is no time limit on response. You progress to higher levels--which means memorizing more numbers faster during the viewing or listening--from an initially determined baseline test taken when first starting. Different voices--men, women, adults, and children--read the auditory presentations.  All and all, I found it to be fairly sophisticated and the exercises do seem help even beyond matters of number memorization. The primary shortcoming seemed to be the lack of feedback or coaching other than telling you not to get discouraged and to keep working hard.  Also, the progress summeraries (bar graphs) fail to take into account the higher levels for scoring purposes so day to day comparison of results seems too flat. Overall, I have enjoyed the program and have stuck with it although there are some days I wish for more variety and to do something else than just repeat numbers. What they say about only having to practice about 10 minutes a day--well--I've had to spend more like 30 minutes or more to do enough exercises to feel satisfied with my progress
