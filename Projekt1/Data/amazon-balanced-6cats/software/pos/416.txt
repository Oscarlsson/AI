I've been a Photoshop user since Version 3 and this upgrade is worth every penny.  I upgraded from version 7 and CS2 is clearly a step up.  Upgrading was a no-brainer.  The only negative is Adobe Bridge - I prefer the file browser that PS 7 had but I can live with it.

The floating image windows is also a nice touch - you are no longer confined to the PS main window.

All of my add-ons worked perfectly including FITS Liberator and the PTLENS suite
