I seriously don't get why people are having problems installing and using Windows Vista. I had no problems installing it and no problems using it. It runs smoothly and responsively. No problems. Current specs:
   3.0GHz Intel Pentium 4 HT 800FSB 1MB L2 Cache
   1.5GB DDR PC3200 667MHz RAM
   200GB SATA 7200rpm 8MB CACHE
   256MB ATI Radeon X600
   Realtek Integrated HD Audio
   Intel 915G Motherboard
   22" Viewsonic VX2235wm HD Digital Monitor   1680x1050
   Optical Drive 1: DVD+/- RW DL
   Optical Drive 2: DVD-ROM
No problemo.
