This is a very good racing simulator!  But it's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you!

It will take you time to perfect the driving skills and learn the handling characteristics of the various cars.  You're going to need a good wheel and pedal combo to get the most of this game.

Graphics are very good, but the race car physics and handling are exceptional.

Highly recommended for racing sim fans, not recommended for the casual race game player
