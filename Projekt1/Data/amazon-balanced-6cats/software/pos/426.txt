This is the most technically excellent racing sim I have played. The physics are perfect, the graphics are pleasing, and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars. The learning curve can be very steep, but you can adjust the AI to suit your needs. You can also turn on traction control, steering aids, etc., which will get you into the game faster. After a couple months, you'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven. There is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing. If you want a realistic racer, buy this game
