Bought this after thoroughly enjoying GT Legends.  If you want to experience the best driving SIM on the market, buy GTR2.  While I love rally, sprints, NASCAR and most other driving games, this one sits on the pole.  Complexity level and your own personal motivation to get better keeps it from getting mundane. Graphics rock.  Get your system up to speed as all these other review suggest and that means a good wheel/pedal combo as well. How good is it?  I've had it several months and I still say it is the best there is.  Semper Fi
