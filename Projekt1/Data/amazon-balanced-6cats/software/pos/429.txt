This 'game' is awesome, if you like SIMs...  

Do not buy this if your goal is to enjoy a leisurely drive once in 
a while.  'Playing' it is hard work and requires your full concentration.
Great tutorials to teach you how to drive on a track (it is *very*
different from taking the family car for a spin).

I got it with my Logitech G25 (an AWESOME FFB wheel).  I think these
two were made for each other.
