I wish the reviewer had stated whether MS Office 2003 Small Business Edition satisfies the requirement. Pending clarification, I'll stick with Encarta 2006 despite its less (than 2005 version) user friendly search page.
Encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and I'm more than willing to predict that 2007 is worthy of 5 stars
