This product is a masterpiece.  It's a testimony to early 21st century thinking about the world, the earth, learning, and software.  It's a Swiss-Army knife of information with a kind of practical beauty that we associate with tools that work. Check out the map tool, and the view of the Earth at night.  It's delight and a gift to an active mind.

Somebody has thought long and hard about what students need on their computer to succeed.  What they've come up with is an awesome collection of innovative productivity tools for kids.

Take math. The math tool alone is worth the price of admission. This is where algebra class should start.  Math lovers will eat it up. For the less than loving, Student includes really excellent tutorials on math concepts.  It even links homework help for many of the major math books.  You put in the textbook, the assignment, and it steps the student through the problems.

Homeschooling? Read no further.  Just buy it.  

Geography? The map tool, especially the statistical mapper lets you view the world from outer space, with or without political boundaries, and compares the performance of countries on a zillion measures.  Literature?  It's got summaries and readers guides for a huge list of required reading, and not just the stuffy Victorian novels, but Ursula LeGuin and even some titles that I didn't think were worth reading.  The language tools -- you can hear a word pronounced in a surprising array of foreign languages,plus dictionaries and translators, and even plugins for MS Word that make it easy to write in French or Spanish.  No more funny key combos to get a cedilla.

Plus Encarta encyclopedia -- which is safer and way more effective at leading kids to track down related ideas than a web search. 

I'm sure I'm leaving something out.

The only problem is, it takes gigabytes of memory and really ought to be partnered with MS Office.  That said, if you take education seriously, you ought to have this on your computer
