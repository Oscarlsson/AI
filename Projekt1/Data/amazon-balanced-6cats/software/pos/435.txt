I initially purchased Creator 9 to do the same thing this software does, but the only thing is it didnt hang my computer when it came down to burn the DVD.  This software is pretty much easy to use, comes with two (Bibles) manuals, plenty of information in there to creat some good videos.  I recommend buying this or you can always buy Creator 9 have it crash your system and then spend a few days trying to review other products out there that have gotten good reviews such as this one. You will be happy with the videos you make. You can make a video containing still images (pictures), video from camcorder camera or from your computer, add text in the movies, add background music, its awesome.  I must say again it wont hang your system. Please get it, your family and yourself wont be disappointed.
