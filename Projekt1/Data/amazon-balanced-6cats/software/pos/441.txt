H&R Block 2006 works well like it always has. I've used and liked H&R since the Turbotax activation debacle, to the extent that I can like doing income tax! What is great is the media the software comes on. Install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere. Maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday, with piles of used drives in a box, but for now it's a super handy way to store and move a few files. 256 megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive. No matter--the price it right
