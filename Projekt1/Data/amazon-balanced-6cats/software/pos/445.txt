I bought this for my four girls.  they all love it, ad are learning lots.  but the quality of the graphics, characters, and even theme (or story) seem to be low budget.  We have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch (and play).  The overall quality in our other games is much higher.  It is a lot like comparing Disney cartoons to Speed Racer.
BUT...my oldest, who is 11, still enjoys this program and has not complained about anything I write about here
