I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews.  I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding.  He has always had a terrible time with handwriting.  I knew I needed really easy, slow-paced typing instruction for him, or he wouldn't get it.

Well, it's 6 months later and he can now type!  We did it with nothing but this software.  I made him practice about 10 min/day 5 - 7 days/week.  All in all, he found it to be work to learn this new skill, but still rather enjoyable.

There are 11 games included and several of them are very good -- meaning they are really fun AND build typing skills at the same time.  There is also a series of drills, lessons, and typing tests to teach the keyboard.  The keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time, and then you repeat the related drills, lessons, tests, and games until those keys are learned fairly well.  I had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section.  This is what the software recommends, but I had to learn it the hard way.  At first, I let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed.  I ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section.

I would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11.  The cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that.  However, for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons, this would be an excellent way to learn to type too.  I found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software.
