I just bought this thru Best Buy - could have got a better deal thru Amazon - oh well.  This product is amazing and very user friendly.  I really love the fact that it comes with its very own manual not a help guide you can print out yourself wasting all your paper.  It does everything - the props are very realistic, the shapes & edges so cool.  I have filled in very dark pictures using the watercolor feauture and made poor pictures look like works of art.  Not to mention that I can create my own photomontages, collages, & very unique artistic scrapbook pages.  It took me an hour to scrapbook an amazing page including fixing up photos. I will never spend money on scrapbook pages again!   So much fun!!
