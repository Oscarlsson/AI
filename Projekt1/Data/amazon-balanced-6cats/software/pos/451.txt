I really enjoy using this program, much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when I last worked on genealogy.  I love the Ancestry.com feature, it is wonderful to go find your grandparents, great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the US Census.  I have found out a few things that I didn't know, unfortunately my Mother recently passed away, and I have no one to verify some of it with.  I would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now, and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find.  I also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live.  She has traced her family back to the 1500's in Germany...and it appears that they are related to us.  It was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my Great Grandparents headstone.  It was just another branch of the family.  Buy it
