This recommended software is easy to load, except for online requirements to update the files due to changes in the documents from the time of publication/software release.  The files for download was large and took a long time on a dialup internet connection.  

The software was easy to use, without documentation, though documentation would have been much desired.  The time to fill in the data was not too long.  It took about 4-6 hours given that I had been filing all the tax info in a folder with all the references required.  The help in the software was great and insightful.  I preferred using a CPA in the past, but since my taxes has gotten significantly easier, this has been a definite cost savings.

E-filing was easy, but make sure not to lose the cd-sleeve after downloading the software. Otherwise, it costs extra to e-file.  Overall, it appears to be a great software package with great info and help.  I plan to use it next year, Lord willing!
