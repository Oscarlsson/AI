If you don't have an overly complicated tax return I found that TaxCut is great to use.  The thing I like most is the interview.  Even if you don't think you qualify for what it is asking, say "yes".  It will ask more questions.  If indeed you don't qualify you have lost nothing and can proceed with the interview.  In tax year 2005 it uncovered something I had missed and I filed ammended returns for 2004 & 2005 and pocketed $300.  I also was excited about e-filing and direct deposit.  I filed in early February and had both my Federal and State refunds in my account in three weeks.  It comes with Deduction Pro which makes keeping track of things very simple and it all imports for next year.

Amazon had the best price at $49 and free shipping for the February timeframe
