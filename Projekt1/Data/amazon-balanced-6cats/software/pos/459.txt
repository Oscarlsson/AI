Everything I need to file my Fed and State taxes. I did not expect the Deduction pro to be included; pleasely surprised. I have used Taxcut for a few years now. I like the import of previous year tax data (less typing).

It seems H&R has an online version. It would be nice if their online version can import data from my purchased version. Oh well, maybe next year
