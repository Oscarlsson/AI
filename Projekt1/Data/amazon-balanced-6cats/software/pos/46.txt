I have been running Windows XP SP2 and would "never" want to go back to Windows ME or Windows 98. With the XP, I rarely need to re-boot my system, and my PC no longer freezes up. There is a built-in Windows Firewall plus a pop-up blocker which are both awesome. The system is much safer, and I have NEVER had a virus, worm, or trojan horse while running the Windows XP Home with a good internet security/virus program.

One thing: Make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your PC before starting to download, as this does require at least that.

Get it! You won't be disappointed
