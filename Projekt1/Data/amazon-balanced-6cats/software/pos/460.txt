I am a computer repair tech and I can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs. You should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your OS. Most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that, double installs. PLEASE PLEASE ..remove/uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls. then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like CCleaner to remove leftover registry keys, then reboot again and then and only then install your new Antivirus/Security program. I have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system, it works great. A very good product at a very good price. I can't comment on it's tech support, I have never used it
