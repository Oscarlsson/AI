Having a study bible on my palm pilot has been very helpful. Whenever I had some down time I always wished I had my bible. Now I do at all times. It is easy to navigate. Takes up a good amount of memory so just be prepared, but if you have enough memory on a card in your palm, it works great. I have used the memorize help feature a lot as well for memorizing verses. Great product!
