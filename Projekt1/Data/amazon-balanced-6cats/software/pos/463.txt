I purchased this Bible study set to use with my Palm LifeDrive.  It works perfectly on this device.  Truly, it is exactly what I wanted.  

It should be noted that the NIV Bible - and the other translations in the set - obscure God's name (YHWH).  This makes it easy for mainstream nominal Christians to attribute Jesus as being the almighty God - instead of being simply the only begotten son of the almighty God.

But the translations are otherwise rather good - and the tools offered in this software set make it well worth the money.  After all, God is a judge of hearts and intentions rather than the technical errors of man trying to understand Him.  Jesus preached love of even our enemies rather than legalistic jargon.

It would have been great if the set included an interlinear (word for word translation) of both Old and New Testaments.  That would have been a very great addition; but it would have doubled the cost.  If such becomes available I will gladly pay the price
