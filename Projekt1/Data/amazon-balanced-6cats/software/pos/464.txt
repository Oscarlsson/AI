I bought this NIV study bible and really enjoy the options it provides:  Daily memorization.  Morning and Evening Meditation and Many different ways to "Read the whole bible in a year... read "OT NT PS and Pr. in a year".  N.T. in six months".  "Daily light on a daily path".  Etc.  There are many ways to approach your daily study.   Easy to navigate and can even highlight in colors.   I would recommend this for anyone who wants to take the bible with them on the road or to work or wherever you take your Palm Pilot.
