I've been using TurboTax since 1999. We run two small companies and my background is in accounting. Hence, I have a VERY hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do, since I really have a hard time letting go of the control! (I've really got to get over that!!) Each year, it seems that TurboTax does nothing but improve! I typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on April 14, and if it wasn't for the simplicity fo this software, I'd be filing extentions every year. Really, gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part. This software does everything else for you.
