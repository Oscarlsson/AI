I was a Norton user for a long time.  I think this is a better program -- lighter, leaner, easier to use.  It automatically updates frequently.  I've never had a virus.  I use wireless and I can always tell if someone is trying to use my system (which is never, but I've tried to break in myself just to check.)  Nice program
