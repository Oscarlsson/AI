I have always used Norton Products for antivirus.  For the previous 12 months I had problems getting the auto update feature to work and as a result had to download new definitions every time I turned on my computer.  (a royal pain!)  At renewal time, I looked around and found PC-cillin software was highly recommended.  I bought it and loaded it easily.  Since I'm not very computer savy, it took me a little extra time to figure out some of the settings.  It works well.  I miss a couple of Norton features like adding an email sender to the blocked list with one click - but updates load by themselves and I've had no problems.
