I found the product to work very well for antivirus, spyware and spam.  It is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance.  I had been using Norton 2004, but it only did a good job on viruses.  Although it would detect spyware after the fact, it did a poor job of removing them.  I had also used the MS beta, which although detected more spyware than Norton, would not block it.  I had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware.  Since I installed PC-Cillin, I've had no problems.  I've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well, catching about 80% of the spam.  I had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook, that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam, so this is a big improvement. 
My only complaint is the rebate- I sent in the required info and it was rejected due to "invalid/missing UPS."  I then sent a copy of the UPS they indicated that was missing, but never got anything back.
