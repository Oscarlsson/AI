I became a committed user of OneNote in its orginal version in 2003. The new 2007 version seems to improve somewhat on this product's functionality. I use OneNote as a depository for research information collection. I can create any number of notebooks and subdivide each into any number of sections and subsections, which allows me to put information where I want it. I recommend that people who collect information in one form or another give OneNote a try.
