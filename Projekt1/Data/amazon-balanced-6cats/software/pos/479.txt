I've been using OneNote since it was first released.  The 2007 release is the most effective writing/note-taking/information-organizing tool I've ever seen.  Data can be exchanged with other MS Office programs easily.  It can be used with tablet p.c.s, desktops and laptops. 

Information can be organized by Notebook, Section and Page (great for students to keep their notes organized efficiently).  It is a great way to keep research notes, cut-and-paste exerpts, etc.  

This is, quite possibly, the most useful piece of software on the market
