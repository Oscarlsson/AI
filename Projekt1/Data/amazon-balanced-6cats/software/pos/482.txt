I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on.

Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun. 

Here are some of the beneficial features:

-Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like.

-You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze.

-Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time.

-It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature.

-As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool.

Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.
