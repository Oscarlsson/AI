I have used OneNote 2003 for a couple of years now, and it is a fantastic program.  OneNote 2007 is a very nice upgrade.  It is extremely versatile and works with a variety of organizational styles.  I have gone nearly paperless for my projects.  I can pull in emails, web pages, graphics, scanned documents, MS Office (and other) documents, screen clippings (a OneNote feature), Excel tables, links to files and web sites, etc. OneNote 2007 adds a a better, more intuitive interface, and integrates better with Outlook (e.g., the tasks work together better) and other Office programs.  (Note:  I sue Outlook 2003 at work and Outlook 2007 at home, and OneNote seems to work fine with both).  It also integrates better with Windows Mobile Smartphones and PDAs.  OneNote2007 has a Mobile OneNote component that allows you to take notes on your PDA/Smratphone, and sync them with "Unfiled Notes" tab in OneNote.

A great program that is sure to catch major traction in the coming years
