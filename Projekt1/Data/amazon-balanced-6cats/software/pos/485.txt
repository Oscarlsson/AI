I enjoy using Encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information. I use it in conjunction with Britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information. I do prefer the interface and ease to Britannica 2007 but the quality of information on Britannica is always to be trusted. 

My advice you need to buy both
