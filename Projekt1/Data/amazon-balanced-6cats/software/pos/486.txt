Kudos Microsoft. My last go around with Encare was with the 2004 version. At that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface. The various modules weren't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore, confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly. The new interface is quite simple but very powerful. It is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating. Perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics. If you have not tried Encarta in a while, check it out, there is much to like.
