I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.

An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.

In Response to Linux Users-
Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.

For Mac Users-
Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's
