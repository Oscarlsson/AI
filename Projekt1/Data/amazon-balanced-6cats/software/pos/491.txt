Purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday.

Reason? My computer was moving much slower than it used to. Mcafee scans my computer everyday, and doesn't find anything, yet it was fully updated. I had a feeling it wasn't working.

When I installed this thing, I scanned it right away. This is what it found:

Viruses: 67

Spyware: 312

Adware: 51

After the scan, everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again. I am very pleased with Panda's software and will purchase again if needed
