If you don't need outlook but do need powerpoint, this is a great value.  Before, you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price (full retail $150 now).  Office 2003 standard even on eBay is still going for $175 plus.  This does not offer anything much beyond Office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn.  Also, don't worry about file formats.  You can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of Microsoft Office.
