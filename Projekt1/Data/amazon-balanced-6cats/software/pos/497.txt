All in all a fine product.  Has gotten excellent reviews from PC MAG.

Norton slowed my machine to a crawl.  This has not.

Suggest NEVER paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to.  I've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up.

It does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web.  For a non techie, this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage
