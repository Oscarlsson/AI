This is what you need if you want a suite of protection for you pc.
I've used mcafee. It drove me nuts. I've used norton. Also drove me nuts. ZoneAlarm worked nearly flawlessly (as well as windows can.) It is a very stable and intuitive program that is what I have been looking for. All I can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you're using now, especially if it's Mcafee or norton. Just a sidenote: I run AVG free antivirus alongside this and I also ran it alongside norton and mcafee. AVG would catch things that neither Norton nor mcafee would. Never have had that problem with ZoneAlarm
