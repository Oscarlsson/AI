I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.

Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.

I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.

Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars
