I had to put this review in because of the unfair one previously given. 
  Before I purchased this software, I checked out 5-6 of the major fish screensavers out their and this one is by far the most realistic, (movement, background, lighting, and noise).  I have two computers, one 800 mHz the other 1.4 gHz processor and the program runs perfect on both.  The goldfish screensaver is just as impressive, if you're into that kind of fish.  Don't let other marine/freshwater screen savers fool you by advertising more fish and backgrounds, the quality in all aspects, especially 3d-graphics and color (which are a must if your looking for realism), are poor.  I personally thought I'd like the extra fish and backgrounds (turtles in particular) in a competitors screen saver, so I purchased it instead of this one.  After trying it, I was very disapointed and luckily I was able to receive a refund.  I purchased Marine Aquariun and have never regretted it since.  What's great is they have a demo on their website your can try out too
