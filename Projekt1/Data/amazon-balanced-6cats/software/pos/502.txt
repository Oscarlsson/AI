I got Tiger to improve the working of my Powerbook G4 1.5.  My Jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with Tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer.  Before Tiger, my computer would hang when playing large DV files (such as the ones I made in iMovie) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same.  This Tiger upgrade doesn't include some of the apps (games, Quicken, etc.) that my wife has on her new MacBook, but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iWorks which has come in handy
