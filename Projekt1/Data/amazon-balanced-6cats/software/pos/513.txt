I have used Quickbooks Basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business.  I have kept QB 2004 Basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me.

I chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance, etc. so again I chose the most basic product offered - "Simple Start".  I received it just fine and it installed perfectly.

However, it does not upgrade any previous QB files.  As I investigated, Intuit says that it won't upgrade files from previous QB versions on their web site (albeit in small print) and on the product box itself, but that was not ever mentioned in the Amazon listing.

So then I had to upgrade to the next higher version - an additional $80.  QB Pro also works very well; it's just a shame that Intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels.  The Intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me $20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when I pointed out their error a second time.
