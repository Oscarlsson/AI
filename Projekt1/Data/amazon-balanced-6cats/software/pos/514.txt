Great backup solution. I install a second hard drive into someones computer and then let the software run and then forget about it. Never fails. Have not done a restore yet, but I would imagine it would be easy since I have an image of the hard drive and then the data that is up to date. Also, bought the software from a vendor that Amazon recommends, I don't no why they do this, but the software listed on Amazon is $49.99 which is the right price. I bought two from a vendor for $15.00 each. WOW what a savings and a great markup for me
