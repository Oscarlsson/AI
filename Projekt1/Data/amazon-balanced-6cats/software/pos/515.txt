All I needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my Dell laptop, so I got Acronis True Image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10.

I put the new hard drive (right off the sealed box) into a USB caddy that I got on eBay for $6, plugged it into the USB port, and ran Acronis 9.  Selected the "Clone Drive" wizard, and less than an hour later it was done.

No need to cross my fingers... the new drive booted right up, and I'm using it now to write this review.  What could be easier
