I recently purchased Microsoft office, and so far, I have had the chance to use Microsoft word.  I am familiar with the product as I have had the older version before, with my old computer.  
I was pleased to find that I had no trouble with using my old files with this new software.  I also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use.  I was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning.  
I am also glad that it isn't very much different from the old version, so I was able to use the program easily, without much adjustment.
