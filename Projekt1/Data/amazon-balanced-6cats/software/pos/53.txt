Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.

I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.

This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.

I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).

If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again
