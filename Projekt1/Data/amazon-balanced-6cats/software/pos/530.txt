Don't think about video capture cards, going into the operating system, or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power, plug Dazzle's USB plug into your usb port, and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on Dazzle, install the software, and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting.

EXCELLENT quality, and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like, say, if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r. The test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes, and your work is DONE.

I REALLY like the fact that the software is so stable, I recorded a SIX HOUR VCR tape using a 512 meg XP machine - not a moment's problem.

They also included software that makes editing these video files real easy, if you want. That is just icing on the cake.

Strong, solid, silent - the John Wayne of VCR to computer file translator tools.

As an aside, I have held onto some VCR tapes for years, one for more than a decade, hoping something like Dazzle would come along.

Prayers answered.

Just shut up and BUY it
