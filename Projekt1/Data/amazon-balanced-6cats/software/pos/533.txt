I did not think that introduction to the game was going to end.  I thought that I may be able to skip it but no luck.  Once into the game I believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills.  Lastly, you have to hit the "F" keys and "Esc" to save and exit the game, not many program make you do that today.

Overall, I feel that this was a good purchase and I would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program
