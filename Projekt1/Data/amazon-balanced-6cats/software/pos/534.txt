the mia series are great for our family.  the kids always look forward to playing their mia games.  they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy.  the two disc thing is confusing...but really doesn't interrupt play.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes...mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond.  we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart.  so it's not too big a deal.
