I've been a Corel user since ver 5 or so. It's always been a decent graphics application, but Ver 12 and now 3X are the best I've ever seen. This program is SO INTUITIVE compared to others in this category. It;s particularly easier than Quarkxpress. I know Quark's a page layout app, but you can do the exact same stuff 95% of the time in Corel. Much better PDF's and a HUGE price advantage make this their best version yet. Indesign is also very good but pure useability gives Corel an edge.
