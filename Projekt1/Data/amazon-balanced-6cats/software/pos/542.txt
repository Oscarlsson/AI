Every once in a while a product comes along that does one thing, and does it really well. The only question is "do you need it" With modern LCD screens and sleep/energy save modes, screen savers are virtually unnecessary. That's really the point of Aquazone, it has no practical value, but it is very cool.

Before we got our little dog Tova, we had a fish tank for a number of years. I do miss some of the relaxing aspects of watching fish swim around and interact. Fish are generally low maintance and considered by many a key stress reducer. I think of this screen saver program as a virtual tamagotchi or a aquatic version of the Sims. You can do everything you would do with a normal fish tank: add and remove fish, feed them, tap on the glass (or the keyboard in this case). Even better, you can mix fresh water and salt water, no worries about two male Betas in the same tank Fortunately you don't have to clean the tank and you don't get algae. If you want fish not included in the tank, you can buy some more online
If you ( or someone you know) enjoys fish and want to buy something fun and rather frivolous, this is a great program. If you aren't into fish, probably not worth buying

Pros: Does exactly what is says, creates a virtual fish tank
Cons: Probably a productivity waster at the office, gotta love fish to enjoy the program
