Well its definetly improved version since the last one, but they still have a lot of things to do.  The biggest problem is Pages.  If text has specific symbols, like Greek letters and u try to export your file to doc, forget it.  u'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago, either funky symbols or underline dashes.  Keynote is much better.  But if u r a scientist and not a sales man, both packages still have a lot of room for improvement.  However, I'm still happy with this purchase, because it's Apple soft and looks much nicer than any MS software will get in the future
