Abobe hits one out of the park. I find Adobe software clunky and hard to use. While I understand that the more flexibility you want the more complex the program but Photoshop and InDesign have learning curves that are steeper than Mount Everest. I expected Lightroom to be the same - an excellent program with a huge learning curve. Well it is and it isn't which it why Lightroom is such a pleasure to use. I don't know what Adobe is thinking in creating this gem of a program but the team who designed it are collective geniuses. For they have taken a complex and sometimes frustrating chore and for lack of better words made it gentle and pleasing. The program makes spending time with your photographs actually enjoyable.

Lightroom is fabulous from look and feel to functionality. The strength is not only in the photo management portion of the program but also in the strong photo developing functions that can turn an OK photo into an amazing one.

If you do anything with photographs buy this program. You won't regret it
