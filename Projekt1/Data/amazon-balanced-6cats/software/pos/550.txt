This is a great software for Photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images. I gave it a four because I would hope that ADOBE would still find ways to improve this product. The functionality is superb, and for such a great program, it doesn't eat too much memory on your computer (I have a 4 year old PC with 768 MB of RAM). And because of this I'm shooting more pictures in RAW format and not worry about the time I spend in front of the computer.

I'll definitely be buying the next upgrade
