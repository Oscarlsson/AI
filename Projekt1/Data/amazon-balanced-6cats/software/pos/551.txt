Within a couple days after installing Dragon, it showed a high degree of accuracy. The accuracy depends on how late at night you dictate.  It was installed on a 2.7 Celeron with 512 of memory.  The program generally keeps up quite well. The program works with Comcast and AOL free ride but seem to have a lot of glitches with aol.com
