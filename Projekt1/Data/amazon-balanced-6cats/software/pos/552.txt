This is probably one of the most outstanding and rewarding software programs that I can ever remember purchasing. I never learned how to type, so I reserved myself from many computer projects/reports, email responses and business related aspects due to this 'achilles heel'.

Well, I researched this software and found that it has come a long way from earlier versions and decided it's time to give it a try. I even bought a Plantronics CS55 - USB wireless headset from the get go to give this software a real workout. Let me tell you, my pessimism was definitely challenged because the software worked extremely good about 20 minutes after opening the box and browsing the tutorial. I was talking sentences and watched it appear on my monitor within seconds. I speeded up my speach as if talking in a normal conversation with someone and this software just kept spitting it on-screen. AMAZING!!!! Don't get me wrong. There are occasional misspellings to deal with but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it and prevents the same mistakes from occuring the next time. It begins to gain more and more accuracy.

Salvation has been found as far as I'm concerned.

P.S. I began running the program with WIN XP - 512MB Ram and it performed very well. I just upped to 2 gigs ram. Most everyone in forums recommends at least 1 gig Ram.

I did this review in about 1 min. and had only two misspells.
