I really enjoy this product, and am sure that voice-recognition will be standard techology for all computers one day.  It is very easy to load, set up and use....  everything that I needed was in the box. I speak with a slight accent, and it still works so smoothly. This is an invaluable tool for people at risk from carpal tunnel syndrome, for those who have difficulty using a keyboard efficiently, or for avoiding the fatigue of preparing large reports. It is so simple that you can speak out ideas and visualize them in print before deciding what to do next.  Great for doing e-mail...  all this and you can continue using the keyboard as you wish. I love it!
