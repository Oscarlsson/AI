i really like my new windows vista upgrade.the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly.infact, i liked vista business so much, i upgraded to the ultimate version.both versions are very easy to install;many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but, honestly, the bugs aren't a problem.it is important to run the advisor about -is your system ready for vista before you install- to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista;other than that everything else is a breeze. Use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it, you'll have lots of fun!
