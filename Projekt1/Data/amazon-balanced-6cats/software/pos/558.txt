I just upgraded SD v4 to SD5 and could not be happier. Release 5 has had a very rocky start to say the least. I do believe they released it a bit early. Fortunately I read the SD forums daily and only downloaded version 5 when it seemed the big bugs had been dealt with.
I have always found this product to be the best in it's class. Best detection and moreover removal. Easy to use. I've also had the product that is typically rated number 1 and for me it is no contest which I will stick with. This is my main, real time anti spyware product. 
I think one big plus is their customer service availability. This is important.  They are very responsive. Their forums on their website are also extremely helpful. Customer service is also free.  This application is fast and is not a resource hog. I have a lot of confidence in it. Also recently just downloaded their PC Tools Plus firewall...it's another great product and it is free!
Basically a good company to deal with.  I believe when the dust settles from this new (albeit too early) release of version 5, you will see Spyware Doctor attain 1st place on many tech lists
