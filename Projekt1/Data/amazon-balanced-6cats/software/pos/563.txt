I am very pleased with the new 2007 Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe.  I have owned previous versions of this product and for my needs, I am well satisfied.  I especially like the ability to use suggested greetings and clip art to enhance my rubber stamped cards and scrapbooking projects.  I have used this software to print banners and business flyers as well.  It would be nice if multiple images could be contained in a text box.  Maybe in the future there will be more enhancements to this product for easiser use.  I am pleased with the card selection, verses and graphics.  For non professionals, I believe you get more than a fair value for the price
