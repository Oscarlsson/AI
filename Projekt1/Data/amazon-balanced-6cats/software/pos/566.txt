I bought this program for my daughter for her birthday.  She wanted it because she's used it at school (1st grade).  

I was impressed by how easy it was to install - I installed it as admin, and she had no issues running it under her limited account (XP PRO).

I've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program.  She even made Valentine's day cards for her whole class with it.

Just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink
