Essential for Microsoft Office 2007 users running Windows Vista. Office 2007 already provides a PDF converter; however, it does not allow for security, editing, or markup. PDF Converter does--and without the Tech Support hassles at Adobe. Since my new HP computer came with Adobe Reader already installed in the Vista environment, I kept it as the default pdf reader, and I use PDF Converter Professional for actual, stand alone conversion or editing of pdf documents. PDF Converter had a very easy Custom Install feature. I disabled all Microft Office, Internet Explorer, and Outlook add-ins, and I installed the product. It all works together extremely well.
