Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem.  As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great.  You do get a variety of photos of objects.  For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries.  For $17 this is definitely worth the money.

I've found it is best to export the image to a graphic editor.  Then from there, make it transparent, resize it, and compress it to your wishes.  There's a fair amount of "People" graphic, but not as much as I'd like.  I don't have the 100K collection so don't know if there's any image overlapse between this and that collection.

Quality is pretty nice for small prints and great for web.  Especially superb for smaller projects like christmas cards and so forth, but not good if you want to print high resolution photographs on large paper.

For $17 this is the best collection I've ever bought, Photo Objects II is still in shipping, so can't compare quality with that collection yet.
