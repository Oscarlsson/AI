I have not used this product for very long, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase another brand besides Adobe who seem to dominate in this softward category, but I have, so far, been plaesantly surprised with the performance & features.  The ScanSoft PDF Converter Pro 4 software seems to do all Adobe can do (and a little more), at a fraction of the exhorbitant cost of Adobe Pro 8!.  I'm happy with my purchase thus far!
