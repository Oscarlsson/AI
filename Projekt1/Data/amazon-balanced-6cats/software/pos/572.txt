After looking at the other reviews, I was a bit puzzled.  I haven't had any of the problems other folks mention. PDF Converter Professional 4 doesn't do everything that programs costing FIVE TIMES as much money.  But, WHO CARES?  Background colors in a business form?  WHY????  

Don't buy a Camry and say "gee... I liked my Lexus better."

Most of you are going to buy this program to do one - or both - of these two things: 
 
1)CONVERT PDF DOCUMENTS into completely editable Word docs, Excel Worksheets, or one of dozens of other formats...

2)COMBINE documents of various formats into a single pdf. Picture a CUSTOMER MANUAL that consists of Word, Excel, SolidWorks, Quicken, PowerPoint and Project documents.   You want to put them all together in ONE document complete with Table of Contents, Bookmarks and Thumbnails.  VOILA!  This is the proram for you! 

And for these purposes, PDF 4 Professional is SUPERB.  It is EASY to use. We have SEVERAL users, and not one has had to refer to a manual or on line support. 

To put PDF Converter to the test, we recently scanned, then saved-as-a-pdf a crooked, not highly legible fax.  We THEN converted it into a Word document, and roughly 90% of it came through perfectly.  AMAZING.
