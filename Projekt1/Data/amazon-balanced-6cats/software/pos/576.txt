I am average when it comes to design, but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it.  I like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background.  To get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already, and there's a lot I am missing.  I will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error
