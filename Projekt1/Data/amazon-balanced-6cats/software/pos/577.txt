I have been a Corel user for years.  This latest version is a great improvement.  Esp for Raster to Vector tracing.  I have always preferred to use Corel over our Illustrator even though I have both installed on my system.  Corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program.  Very powerful for anyone from Novice to Pro user
