I love this product. I had so many pictures that need to be in a scrapbook. This was so fast and easy, also it only took a couple of weeks to complete. I didn't over spend on paper,tape,glue, and etc. With three kids I don't have the time to sit down and cut, measure and more. with all my pages completed. I added a FEW things to go along with the theme of my page. I even used left over Christmas wrap to fill the 12X12 for Christmas pictures/theme
