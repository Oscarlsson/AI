I had a hard time putting this one down. I quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly. I would recommend this to any X-men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if I had the hardcopy versions. 
My only complaint is that it ends at the beginning of a new story. Ah well..
