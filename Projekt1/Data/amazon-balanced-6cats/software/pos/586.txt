This works fairly well for me.  It easily downloads the capital gains from Microsoft Money, the interviews are fairly straightforward.  However there are a few areas (like foreign tax credit) where it should be automated but isn't.  But on the whole it does a nice job, they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item.
