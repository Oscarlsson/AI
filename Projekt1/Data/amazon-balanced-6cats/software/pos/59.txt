Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics.  Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D. 

Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors, & hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive).  Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed.

Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design
