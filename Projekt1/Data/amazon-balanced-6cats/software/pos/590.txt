First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary
