Took a couple of attempts to load this program on my laptop but once installed, it's more than I expected.  This is my first experience with GPS and I'm impressed with how quickly and accurately the GPS system locates my position and tracks my movement.  Full featured mapping software and plenty of GPS options make this an excellent value for my needs
