Would highly recommend. We attend dog show that are in the middle of no were... This product got us to EVERY SHOW  we have been to since we started using it in March 2007.We especially in enjoyed the feature of being able to find what kind of business were in the area were.We hate getting lost especially with a truck loaded down with dogs and conformation equiptment, this product has stopped that from happening.   It would be nice if the 2008 version: 1 - it spoke the name of the streets while it was giving you the next turn 2- it would get rid of that agreement screen everytime you use it, once should be enough and 3 - It would be nice if we could log on to the web and down load the latest addition of gas station, place to eat and etc...  while we were down loading the construction updates. This product is a good buy for the money..
