Just completed a 1600 mile trip from Ohio to Virginia Beach and the Microsoft Streets and Trips with GPS worked better than expected. Only lost the GPS in extremely hilly areas. No loss in towns. This thing is very precise for the low price paid. If you pull into a place such as a Gas Station, you have the address immediately. It can route you back to your mapped routing if you make a wrong turn. Pressing the space bar will get you the next turn in case you missed hearing the last prompt. This is a powerful program and should be an asset to any traveler. A co-pilot is good to have but not totally necessary. As mentioned above, it will route you back to your road if needed. A great buy. Would be nice if the prompt would name the street or route
