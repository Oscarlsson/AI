Purchased this to help navigate a trip from Northern Michigan to South-west Florida and back again. We took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go.  There were a couple of times that we went "off route" but were back on route in very little time.  It helped us decide where to stop for fuel, eat and sleep.  Up-to-date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map-viewing area was greatly appreciated.  Well worth the price.  Highly recommended to others
