I do a lot of work out of town and in other states, so I am constantly in unfamiliar or different places. This GPS has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its' self in saved mileage that I used to spend looking for places. I have recommended it to everyone that I have talked to. It's great, I will never have to Mapquest or ask for directions again. Another Great Microsoft Product
