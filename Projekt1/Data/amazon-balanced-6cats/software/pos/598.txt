Connecting the cables was so easy I was sure I must have missed something.
Recording the music is equally easy.  Removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap.  My only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms, I should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono, you can not remove the crackle and pop
