Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer.

It's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers I will point out its minor drawbacks. First, audacity, the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit.  However, I don't know if it will freeze up on your computer.  Second, if you are thinking about buying this product to turn LPs to CDs, into most LP players don't have RCA AUX plugs and you'll need to buy an addapter.  
(What they don't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky.) Finally, the manual could use more detail because some of the important features weren't mentioned.   

If you don't mind these drawbacks, you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product
