I bought this to transfer LPs to CD. It is simple to connect to the computer, and the software is easy to use. Just be sure when you download  the MP3 encoding program,  to put it in the same directory as the LP ripper.
The LP recorder works  well and is very easy to use. The LP Ripper, makes it easy to trim the tracks, and then encode them as MP3 files. 
When saving them as MP3's I can get approximately 20 LP's on one CD.
I am very satisfied with the product
