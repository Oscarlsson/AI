Product is excellent does what it says and then some.  Instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow (a winner in my book).  I had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo I was using in the fact that it didn't have outputs for audio so I was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the RCA cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product.  I converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software.  Used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks, actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off. I only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money, overall.  I then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3's with no problem. This is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp's and cassettes.  The sound is excellent on playback.
