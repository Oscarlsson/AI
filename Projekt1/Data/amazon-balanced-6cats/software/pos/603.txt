This product is very easy to install and use. In couple of minutes, I was able to set it up. I used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well. 
The reason I give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to DVD/CD/MP3 format
