INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.  

The quality of the transfer is very good (imo).  For example, I was playing back So. Central Rain (early REM) in ITunes and noticed that I had purchased the song on ITunes about a year ago.  Except for an opening click on the LP version, its very hard to tell the difference between the two.

My only minor negative (or really, feature request) would be for LPRipper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that I don't have to type them all in.
