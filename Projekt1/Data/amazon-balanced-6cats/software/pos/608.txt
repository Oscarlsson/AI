What I like about this software is that it does not come with too many "gadgets." At my age, I am "technically challenged." So this software worked out fine for me with my limited computer skills. I also like the fact that this software covers Castilian Spanish. It is probably the only course available that exclusively covers Castilian Spanish in such depth since Pimsleur and Learning Like Crazy only offer Latin American Spanish courses.  
The downside of this software is that you will not learn much Spanish grammar with it. If you want to learn the rules and mechanisms required to combine words and form sentences in Spanish, you will have to buy a good Spanish grammar book. For that I strongly recommend Spanish Grammar for Independent Learners by Avigail Azoulay, Arie Vicente. It is more expensive than other Spanish grammar books but it is well worth the money.
