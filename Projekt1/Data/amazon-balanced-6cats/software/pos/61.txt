There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.

It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.

I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.

The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system
