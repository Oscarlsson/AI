Streets and Trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans. We use it in conjunction with our Garmin 2720 GPS system and they are very complementary. The Garmin system doesn't use downloads from the laptop and Streets and Trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home. This is a very good program for trip planning
