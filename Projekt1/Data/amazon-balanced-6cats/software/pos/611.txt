Although I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com (...), I absolutely love it.  The GPS locator provided is amazing and better than I thought it was.  It is not one of those GPS that updates your position every 20 seconds or something, but when I zoomed in I could see my current location constantly moving on the map (so it is updating every second)...I have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the GPS provided to them isn't even this good.  I recommend this software and GPS to anyone
