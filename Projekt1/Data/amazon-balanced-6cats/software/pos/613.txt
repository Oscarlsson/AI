I travel a lot; this product saves me valuable time in unfamiliar surroundings.  I have my laptop open on the seat and plot my position and where I want to go - it's easy!  If I miss a turn, the "reroute from present position" feature is great!  It takes a little getting used to, but if you tend to be more visual, or you don't generally do well with maps, or maybe you just want to know where you are in relation to where you're going -- MS Streets and Trips is tops
