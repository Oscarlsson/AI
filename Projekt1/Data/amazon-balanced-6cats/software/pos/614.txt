Used this for a trip from NW of Chicago to Houghton, MI (in the U.P.) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections (lost signal a few times). This works best when you have two people (driver and navigator) as looking over at a laptop while driving isn't a good thing! Would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price I wouldn't expect it
