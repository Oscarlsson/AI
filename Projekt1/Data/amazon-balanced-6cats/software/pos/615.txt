This is a cool game in a lot of ways.  I was jazzed about it because of the era it represents.  But the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting.

The huge disapointment, however, is this:  The online registration code is missing.  Utterly missing.  And there is no resource available on the net to help.  The U.S.A. help number is disconnected.  You will not be able to play online.  Period.  The developer's forums are full of posts about this problem.  No resolution....  Beware.

Demand more of the makers of the products you purchase.  This is extremely bad
