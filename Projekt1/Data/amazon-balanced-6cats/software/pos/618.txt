Thats really my only complaint with this game , every time you buy a racing game the cars all seem to be the same . Being in Australia , we had our own fast cars , the Falcon GTHO Phase 111, the HK Monaro GTS and who could forget the Torana GTR/XU1 , Ok this might mean nothing to someone over in the USA or England . But they where supercars in their day ,that said its still a great game for all petrol heads old and young a lik
