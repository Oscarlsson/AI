I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions.  I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events.  I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD.  This program does it all and more.  It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD.  After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results.  I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems.  Looks great on TV.  I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD.  Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos.  For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.
