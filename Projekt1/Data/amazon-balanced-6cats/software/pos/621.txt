A great new interface including control layout, easier than ever to use, and complete. There is no other product in this class. It looks great in XP and even sharper in Vista.

Subject to some agreement with Adbobe, you'll have to download the free PDF writer from Microsoft (the beta came with it), but it works exactly the same and otherwise no suprises.

The product is pricey and you may want to purchase a smaller release (less applications in the suite) depending on your needs
