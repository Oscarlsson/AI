Excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives. You can format, partition, split, merge and a whole lot of other things. If you purchase a large backup hard drive I recommend this software and the Acronis True Image software. With both, you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c:\ drive in one partition and daily backups of My Documents in another. This way in case of a HD crash you have a bootable backup. (Note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive.) Thats why I recommend both Acronis software packages
