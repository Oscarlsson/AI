I am a Friends fan and I really enjoyed this game. The questions vary in difficulty, and the narration by the characters is a nice feature.

Regarding the issues with the keyboard, the keys for each player are indeed very close together. Also, when two players can answer the same question at the same time, it's easy to press the wrong key by mistake. But I guess in time you can get used to the keys.

I didn't have a problem installing the game, although I have a CD recorder and recording software installed. I didn't choose the full instalation, since the CD has to be in the drive anyway, but the game runs properly, it didn't seem to freeze when reading from the CD.

Compared to SceneIt, it's very different. This is a complete trivia game that keeps score and announces the winner. SceneIt is a board game, and the DVD is used to ask questions, and in order to play it as a trivia game you need to keep score with paper and pen
