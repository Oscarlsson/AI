This DVD-Rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that I don't know after watching every episode numerous times.  I highly recommend this for Friends fans of all ages, regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode.  Also, I love that the game can be played by only one person, for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few Friends to keep you company
