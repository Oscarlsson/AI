I have used this product for over a year now.  The reason I bought it was for the back up software.  Email was a secondary consideration.  Let me talk about the back up for a moment.  It is quick to download and about that easy to start using.  The set up can be done in two ways.  Either by default, or manual.  I chose the default version which covers my home folders and it automatically backs up everything to my external hard drive at a time of my choosing.  It will also set up a seperate version of a back up of vital stuff to an online storage for you that you get when you buy .mac as well.  Restoring a lost file couldn't be easier.  just click on restore and the locate the file (or files) you want to restore.  The program is set up so that everything is named exactly as you originally named it on your hard drive.  You don't have to look for your file name in a long string of code.  Just select it and click restore.  It will either put it in the exact place of your old file or in new location of your choosing.   I haven't really messed with the other features yet, but the email is spam free and has been my default email for over a year now with out any problems.  Hope you buy the service and will enjoy it as much as I have
