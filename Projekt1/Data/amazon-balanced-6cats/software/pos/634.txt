I have had .Mac for years and enjoyed using its functions.  I have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iWeb sites.  Plus I use it for syncing and backup, etc.  I am not a power user, however.  But it's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily.
