High Fives to PaperPort 11 Pro!  Being in a business where I am constantly told to print this and print that off of one website and another,  a product like PaperPort Professional 11 has really come to my rescue.   The product has given the opportunity to do something with a document, picture, or file other than printing 

Now when I  select the document or file and hit my print option button,  I now can print it to a multi-page PDF,  If I choose to do so. Files that I download, scan, save, or  archive are no longer just random clutter on my hard drive,  I can retrieve the information from  them effortlessly using the product's powerful search engine.

I was thrilled to find that its All-In-One Search Engine was able to work with files generated in many MS Office applications.  All I needed to do was remember some of the content text and the PP Pro 11 would find the file for me.

Now I'm stacking individual MS Office Files into logically-named PDF groups or using the product to search the web and retrieve information of interest, I find  PP Pro 11 to be well worth the money and my time to use it.
