I downloaded the demo of this program and although I am by no means a pro photographer I do have over 4,000 digital photographs of my family and I am taking new photos each day. In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos.  I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first
