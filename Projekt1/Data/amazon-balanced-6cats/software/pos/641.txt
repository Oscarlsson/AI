I read horror storied about 7.0 Nero so I upgraded to 6.6 from 5.5 by going to the Amazon new & used market.  This is a good program that does all you need for DVD's and CD's.  It gets good reviews.  I can't imagine what happened to 7.0 but they may have gotten carried away with "user friendly-ness" - I see a little of that in 6.6 compared to 5.5
