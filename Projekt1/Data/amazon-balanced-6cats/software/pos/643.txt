Nero 6 is a wonderful product, but you need to get a legal copy of the full retail version, not an OEM CD or a CD of questionable origin. At this time (April 2006) the best place to get it is from the Ahead Software website (the makers of Nero). (You can get a retail box of Nero 7 just about anywhere, but Nero 6.6 seems to be more stable and provides all the functionality most users will need.) You can download a demo, then purchase a serial number to unlock the full product. It's a smooth, easy transaction. After many headaches I discovered that the OEM version that came with my DVD burner would allow me to capture video from my camcorder, but wouldn't let me burn them to DVDs. My choice was to either buy a CD of questionable origin (and one that is almost certifiably illegal) on eBay, purchase a DVD burning plug-in from Ahead Software for $24.99, or purchase the whole suite for $80.00. I chose the latter. Using my installed OEM version, I purchased the serial number, entered it into the product (very easy to do), then downloaded the latest updates, and I was off and running. This software produces very high quality DVDs and can burn a disk in 15 to 20 minutes using an inexpensive 16x NEC DVD burner. I am now a happy consumer with a stack of DVDs containing transferred videos of great quality
