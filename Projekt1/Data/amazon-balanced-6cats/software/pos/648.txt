Look, notation software is notoriously expensive.  All musicians know that.  So, when you see SongWriter and its price, it's a relief.  Everything you need is in this program.  I only have one complaint.

When adding an expressive dynamic (p,mp,mf,f,ff,etc.) you have to add one to EACH note to insure proper playback.  That is a concern of mine since I use SongWriter to notate songs and export them in MIDI for recording purposes.  It leaves an ugly looking score.

Other than that, this is the best deal on the market for what it is
