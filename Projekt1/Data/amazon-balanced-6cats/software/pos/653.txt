I got a hold of a Windows Vista Ultimate disk.  It gave the choice to install Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, or Ultimate.  I installed Vista Home Basic, because I only have 512 MB of RAM. 

Likes:
I like the new wallpapers and the way it looks.  My Documents and My Music folder remind me of iTunes.

Dislikes:
Don't like that my less than 6 month old HP printer doesn't work with Vista and my USB net link cable doesn't work with Vista.  When you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it.  It's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue.  

Verdict:
I like it, but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with XP. I wouldn't buy Home Basic.  If you really want Vista, buy a new computer with Vista preinstalled or install a trial version of Vista to make sure everything works.  I'm going back to XP, until HP releases Vista drivers for my printer.

I'll write reviews on Home Premium, Business, and/or Ultimate if I ever get more RAM.
