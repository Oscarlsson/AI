At home, I've been a Mac user since 1991. I also have been something of a Linux fanatic too and have used several distros, mostly Red Hat and now Fedora Core. At work, however I have used MS-DOS, Windows 3.11, 95, 98 and XP. It's fair to say I have never liked Microsoft. But on a laptop I use at work (an older Gateway 400VTX with a 2.2GHz Intel Celeron), I just upgraded to Vista Home Basic. I also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1GB. And despite my years of eschewing Microsoft, guess what? I must say I really like the OS. It runs fine on my slower system and I had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers. 

I think Microsoft has really made a "cool" OS
