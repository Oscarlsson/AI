I was hesistant to upgrade to vista for a while but I decided to invest and see what the hype was all about. I have a P4 HT 3.0 Ghz with a good video card and after upgrading my current desktop to 2 GB of ram, I found that vista runs really well on my machine. I bought the home basic because microsoft advised it and I dont need any of the other features offered in premium. I love the graphic capabilities of vista and the functionality is really nice. I had no problems using any of my programs and had to only upgrade my video and sound drivers after installation. Vista installed all of my updated device drivers for me as well. This is definitely a solid OS and I would highly recommend upgrading to vista if you have the recommended hardware requirements
