I am an adult trying to learn Piano.  This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.
The lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play.  The feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length.  However, it does not track the strength of your key press.
I would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs.  Also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.
Overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher
