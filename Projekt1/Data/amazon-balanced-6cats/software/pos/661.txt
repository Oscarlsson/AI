I received my eMedia Piano and Keyboard Method today and it's not a bad program by any means, however I have two gripes with the software: 

First, either the "full screen" option in Preferences doesn't work or eMedia feels that 640x480 counts as a full screen, so if you have your monitor set at a higher resolution (and what Mac user doesn't?) you'll need to lower it in order to read the lessons' text, and since you most likely won't be sitting as close to your laptop/monitor during these lessons, this is kind of important. 

Second, You need to have the program CD in your computer to get the sound and video to play, and the whine of my optical drive is mildly annoying while trying to study/practice. There are workarounds to bypass this type of copyright protection silliness, but it makes me mad that I need to resort to doing this. If eMedia's so paranoid about theft of their product, why don't they just stream the program's media portion from their website?  At least it wouldn't be noisy that way.

Other than these two flaws, the program is excellent for self-starters like me. Plus it seems to be the only complete, low-cost piano/keyboard instruction software out there for Mac OSX. I would have wrote this review after a few weeks of lessons instead of my first day learning but the optical-drive issue really bothered me.
