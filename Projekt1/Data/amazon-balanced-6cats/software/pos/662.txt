I thought that I could never learn piano on my own. All the material that I ever looked into either didn't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good. Because of this software, I am constantly learning new things, and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist. If you are a beginner, you want to buy this software. It's done wonders for me
