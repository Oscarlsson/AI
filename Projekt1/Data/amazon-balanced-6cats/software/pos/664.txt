This CD is a MUST HAVE! You cannot afford to NOT buy it. The information is comprehensive and easy to follow. The format is perfectly set up... you can review a section many times if needed. Every family and individual in America should view this CD to know what to do when a terrorist attack occurs... not IF, but WHEN, it occurs. For instance, before watching this CD I had no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach to remove radioactive materials from your skin, but these items will make chemical burns worse. I feel much better having this knowledge from the CD, and this is just one example of the useful and critical information I learned. The preparation checklists on the CD are awesome for planning ahead. Knowledge will be powerful in protecting yourself and your family in the event of another attack
