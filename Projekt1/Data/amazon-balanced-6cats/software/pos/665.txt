I'm an amateur at website design/building, so understand that I'm not very "deep" in Dreamweaver's abilities. However, I got the program to switch from Adobe GoLive CS2 which had many quirks, bugs, and frustrations. (One example - while you upload your changed files to the web server in GoLive, you can't do anything else in the program. Single tasking!?!?!) After just 30 minutes or so of working with Dreamweaver to update my site, I'm already sure I've made the right decision! I have a long way to go in learning what it can do, but my first impressions of the product are excellent
