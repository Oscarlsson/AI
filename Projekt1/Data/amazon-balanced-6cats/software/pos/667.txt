I'm new to web design.  I've tried other products, including Frontpage, and found them too cumbersome to use and the results were not what I wanted.  Dreamweaver is the best. Easy to use, with more tools to make your web pages look great, even for a beginner.  And there is a lot of support and tutorials on the web to help you out
