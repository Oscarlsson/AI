I'm a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings. This program fits all of my basic needs. This is the first piece of audio software I've ever owned but I know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what I guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you've used Audition 1.5 or CoolEdit. However, as my introduction to music editing, the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and I like the endless options Adobe provides for organizing the workspace. One tip: if you are a student or teacher, don't spend $300; do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over $100.
