This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago
