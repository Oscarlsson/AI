I have been using Printmaster Platinun for several years and love it. I scrapbook constantly using all of the features. I have printed thousands of items with this program. If  people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer.  I have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook, photo programs and only use Printmaster. There is no better program.  Ann
