I've been using PrintMaster for years to create greeting cards, party invitations, banners and posters for my kids' school. This version has a lot of great new art and images and my son has even made personalized cover for his iPod. I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes PrintMaster or wants to create great-looking projects at home
