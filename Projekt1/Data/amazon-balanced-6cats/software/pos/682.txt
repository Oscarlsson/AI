I chose Office Ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything I could possibly need to run a business, but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues.

Ultimate 2007 certainly doesn't disappoint!  

- Set up was fairly easy:  two disks came with the package.  Disk One contains most of the software and Disk Two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the Accounting and key business functions.  

- Ribbon technology removes the old "hunt and find" menu method (although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up).  

- Integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless.

- Excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon.

- Accounting software is included.

- Ink and Crossword.  I'm not one for games on my business pc, but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords, ULTIMATE lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords.  

- OneNote.  I like post-its (perhaps a little too much *L*) and always used the Post-It Note software on my business computer to keep notes.  I used OneNote 2003 sparingly because I simply found the Post-It Note software easier to use on my desktop, BUT...with my Tablet PC One Note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that I feel will work well with my business:  the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality.  I may still use Post-It now and then for quick notes or perhaps the Windows "Stickys," but the long note pages, pasting of images and other web info, and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable.

- Word.  What can I say?  This is my primary software tool and I use it on a tablet pc.  The 2007 applications were made for my computer type.  I can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my Wacom pen and I don't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until I finish the document to then make my edits.

- PowerPoint, Publisher, Access, Groove, InfoPath et cetera (also included): I am still delving into these, but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs.

So, did I have any dislikes?  

1.  The INK program doesn't respond to my Wacom pen as well as the Windows journal or Microsoft OneNote.  It also doesn't have easy to use tools within the software. Since it was an "extra" and will not be my primary desktop publishing, design, or art tool - I'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet. 
2.  Microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program.  As a result, after installation of the first disk and Microsoft's statement that all of my programs were installed, I couldn't find my Accounting software, had no idea that the Accounting software was on the second disk (the second disk, when loaded, doesn't mention that the software is on the disk until AFTER the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications), and wasted over an hour trying to find it.  Also, I'm a "hands on" person and although I have access to the internet whenever I need it, I enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning.  Ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual isn't really necessary (i.e. most questions can be answered by the "Help" window), BUT...for the hefty price tag, I don't think it would have been too much to ask Microsoft to include a basic "this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect" booklet. Also note:  athough Microsoft, through their downloads e-mail updates, provided a "Getting Started" tab with a "how-to" for each major software applications, the tabs had to be added "after the fact" and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software.

Beside those few quirks, I fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through Amazon (i.e. Amazon's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors).
