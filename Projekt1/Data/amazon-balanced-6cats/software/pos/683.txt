For the first time in several versions Microsoft has changed the file format.  However, it is for the better.  The new files are all compressed using the ZIP compression format so files are MUCH smaller (old files are 3-4 times larger than new files).  The new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification (i.e. Linux geeks can open Office documents).

The new interface is RADICALLY different.  Do not install this if you have a large project to complete.  The interface is SO different you will not complete on time.  However, after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it
