I read the review centering on the box the DVD comes in and must admit that I was stumped as well.  It was "different" but I don't foresee this as being a problem overall.

The new Office Ultimate 2007 loaded quickly.  How quickly?  Well, I had to check my new Vista HP notebook because I couldn't believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time.  It asked for the Product Key and one or two other bits of data but that was it.  Out of all the Office suites I have owned, this one loaded so quickly I was sure there was a problem.  Nope.  Access, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, OneNote, Excel, Groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated (don't worry; you only do it once, not for each separate program.  Naturally, if you are like me and totally dependent upon email, you'll activate Outlook first).  

The new Office "feels" different.  The ribbons are OK but I would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the Classic (XP) view.  I rely quite a bit on the RESEARCH task pane and I don't mind telling you that it was difficult to find.  The menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion, at least for me.  Of course, finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if Microsoft had put a product manual in the box (yes, the online HELP is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out).

All in all you will find all of your old favorites.  And, true to the Office legacy, they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but I'm willing to bet that after all is said and done, Office Ultimatae 2007 will become the industry standard
