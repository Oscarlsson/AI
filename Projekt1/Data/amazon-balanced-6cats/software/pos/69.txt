I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program
