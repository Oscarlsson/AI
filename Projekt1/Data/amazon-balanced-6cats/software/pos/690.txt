Don't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package. It is the full version ready to be installed. Don't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start. So far, I have not noticed a dime's worth of difference from the Pro version. It is working great.

However, the Vista coupon shipped with my package expired on March 15, 2007. Additionally, the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between October 26, 2006 and March 15, 2007, so don't let the Vista thing induce you
