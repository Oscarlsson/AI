Don't listen to all that crap about how you should get Linux or buy a Mac instead of buying Windows. That will probably be the dumbest choice in your life. This is the full version of windows OEM software. Comes with activation code and Vista upgrade coupon to either Vista Home Basic or Home Premium. Bought from Tiger Direct through amazon.
