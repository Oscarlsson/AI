When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well.

While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks. 

This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien.
