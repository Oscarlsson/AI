There are several real advantages to using Quicken Willmaker software. 

1. The legal part of the software was done by Nolo. They publish an awful lot of do-it-yourself software, and are well respected (if you are not a lawyer). Nolos involvement helps to assure me of a quality product. 

2. The user interface, a fill in the blank approach with a lot of help screens, make the whole process quite easy and painless to go through. 

3. Besides the standard last will, the package includes a number of other documents that you may want decide you need. Among others this includes Living Trust, Living Will, Final Arrangements, Notice to Terminate Joint Credit Card Accounts, Child Care Agreement & instructions, and many more. 

Having said that, there are two problems with the software: 

1. If you live in Louisiana, your laws are based on the French system, not the English system and there is a caution on the box that says: 'Estate planning documents not valid in Louisiana.' 

2. There has been at least one law suit saying that if you fill out the will for another person, you may be practicing law without a license. Do a Google search on 'Heirs sue over will-making software' where someone apparently used this software to do a will for a lady.
