I was using other internet security programs in the past. All had their pros and cons. I decided to switch to PC-Cillin 2006 Home Security Pack and it is the best available!.  It has both virus and spyware protections built in. The scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get. Plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers, a bargain. All in all I am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product. I highly recommend this product to all! Amazon.com as usual had the best price
