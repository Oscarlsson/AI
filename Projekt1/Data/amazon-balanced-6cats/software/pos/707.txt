I've used several other protection packages over the years and am please to say that last year found trend micro.  Their internet protection is imho the best.  Easy to install, doesn't eat up system resources, updates regularly, doesn't conflict with other programs.

Currently installed on 6 systems and I have no complaints at all, only praise
