I had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7.  Even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs.  I can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes.  This reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document.  For these reasons I'm quite satisfied with the purchase
