Microsoft Office Pro 2003 edition is a good product. It installed easily over Office Pro 1997. I haven't had any problems with it (yet). It relies heavily on online links, you probably should have a fast DSL connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links.
Update:
I am using Windows XP with Office Pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the Help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions
