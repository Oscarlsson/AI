I was happy enough with the function of Office XP, and held off upgrading for a long time.  What pushed me over was when I switched to using Outlook as my email client, accessing quite a few POP3 email accounts for various websites.  Getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty: I spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working.

Well, Office 2003's Outlook comes with it's own spam filter.  It works, it's simple and it's unobtrusive.

The other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles, but the upgrades I appreciate most are in Outlook
