I love this especially for it's basic qualities.  I originally started with the version where it could be put on a 1.44 floppy that I got from my dentist, went to version 2001 a few years later. With version 2001 my bank no longer would support downloads for that it, and I knew I would have to upgrade some time.  I was comfortable with 2001 so I was glad to find this 2007 was easy to adapt to just a bit sleeker but adding my ability to download from my bank once again.  For someone who doesn't have the need for all the extras this is perfect
