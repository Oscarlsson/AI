(Review written by my wife, the user.)
I've happily used the Quicken Checkbook program for many years.  When we changed operating systems from Windows XP to Windows Vista, I was unable to get the Quicken 2002 version to work in Vista, so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program.  The only feature I use is the Checkbook program and as far as I'm concerned, it's perfect.  I've never used the download from bank option because I prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives. I use Edit Preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and I couldn't be happier.  The price is reasonable, too
