If you find iMovie complicated, this product is not for you.  If you prefer automatic quick solutions this product may not be for you.  

If you find that you would like more control of your video/audio than you find in iMovie but don't want to spend a lot of money, boy have you come to the right place.

I take quite a lot of home video (new baby and all) and found that iMovie would frustrate me when I couldn't do some more advanced tasks.

iMovie is a great intro product.  If you are new to video, use it until you find that you feel limited (many will never will get to that point).

When (and if) you find that you feel some constraints in iMovie, then move up to FCE.

A note for most, iMovie and FCE typically are not for DVD/Hard Drive camcorders.  They don't have the output necessary to directly connect.  You may want to check with your camcorder manufacturer to see what they have to convert the DVD/HD to content that is usuable in these products
