This was given to my son who is going to be living in China this summer and presently knows no Chinese.  He's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language.  A microphone is a must with this program.  Only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used, like "an old man driving a car"
