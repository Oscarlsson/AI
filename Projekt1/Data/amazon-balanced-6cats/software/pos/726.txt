The program is great.  Sometimes the GPS is slightly off though.  I'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that I'm off route for no reason.  Not really a big deal, just annoying.  Other than that I recommend it as a cheaper version of a GPS sysytem if you own a laptop
