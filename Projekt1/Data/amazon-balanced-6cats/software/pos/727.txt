This is the second generation of this software I have owned.  It is a great navagation tool, better than most online sites and can be used in the car.
I marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the Lexington, Kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth, with new streets and roads.
The software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map, so you don't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night. Major points of interest are also on the map
