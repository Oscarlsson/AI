I use my Microsoft Streets and Trips software to plan my route, intermediate stops, and destination for any travel via automobile or truck.  I am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which I may be unfamiliar.  This is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find.
I have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what Streets and Trips does, and I found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007
