This was the only place I could find Turbo Tax where I did not have to pay extra for state tax.  I live in Washington and we do not have state income tax.  I even asked Intuit how to get a version without the state tax, they said that was not possible.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I will buy from Amazon again next year.

Too bad some people can not read and then blame someone else for problems they caused.  Sound like a couple of 5 year olds.

The only down side for me I received an email from amazon saying shipment would be delayed 15 days.  2 days later the software arrivied, right on the day amazon originally said it should.  Don't know why they sent the 15 day delay email
