I find Turbo Tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program.  I really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version doesn't come with State tax features.  Well, if you are going to shop online, you'd better learn to read the specifications for products!  I came to Amazon precisely because I knew I'd be able to find what I needed, for less.  Texas has no State income tax, so I make sure that I buy Turbo Tax for Federal only.  

Thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest
