I bought Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Professional for home use after having used an older version at work.  The software was very easy to install, activate, and register; and I liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features.  Since I am active with three community service organizations, I welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media "binders." This program makes it easier to email formal reports, create handbills and pamphlets, and post them to my web page.
