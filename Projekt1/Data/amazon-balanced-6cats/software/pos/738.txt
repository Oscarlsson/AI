We found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve. The lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one's learning style.  The accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program. We appreciate the repetition and the spiraling effect used as one progresses through the lessons. So far, we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases.
