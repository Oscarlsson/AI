I had the same problem with Works Suite 2002 that I had with 2006.  The product key that came with the discs would not install Microsoft Word;  the message "invalid product key" came up.  After a computer problem, I reformatted the drive and did a reinstall from the original Works 2002 discs. The invalid key message showed up when I tried to install Word 2002.  After arguing with Microsoft people for three weeks I bought the new Works Suite 2006.  After running all the discs to a clean hard drive, everything worked except,again,the invalid key message came up and wouldn't activate Word. Highly irritating.  I got it going by to Microsoft Works, Programs, clicked Word Document, got an "activate product" and got Word installed and running. This seems to be a dumb glitch in the software
