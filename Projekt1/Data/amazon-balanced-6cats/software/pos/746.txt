Understand. I have a full MS New Office Suite that I got from work.   But choose to use this product for the many items included which can't be beat. If you just want to use Word and nothing else then get it alone. This is fine. But the other products are worth the discount and rebate also. Cost is the lowest I found. If you have a reward ceriticate using Amazon Credit card. That $25 more off the price. So in the end it cost me $30 for it. Shop smart and use any break you could get. Right?
