When I got a new computer at the end of 2001, the 2002 edition was installed on my computer by Gateway. Although I never used Streets and Trips (and barely used Encarta), I used Word and Picture It! quite heavily.

Well, my hard drive died a few weeks ago, and I had to get a new computer. I bought Microsoft Works Suite 2006 to go with it. 

I was a bit apprehensive because Picture It! was replaced with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 Editor. It took me a while to get fluent in Picture It!, and the idea of learning a new photo system was daunting. (I write mostly for the web, and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles--as well as for eBooks.)

I haven't done any extensive work with it yet, but it appears easy to use IF you have experience with Picture It! If you've never used any image program before, it may be a bit confusing. (I feel that Picture It! was more self-explanatory.)

However, for all that the Works Suite gives you, I feel it's a good buy. Word 2002 has advantages over the older version (for example, you can easily insert images), and Encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework (or curious adults wanting to learn more about something).

Updating Encarta is easy as clicking a mouse: just open up the program and click "Update Encarta". New articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer. 

Although I *still* don't use Streets and Trips (I go to MapQuest reflexively), I still think this is a great Suite for a great price
