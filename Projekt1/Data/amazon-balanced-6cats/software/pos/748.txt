I use MS Office at work, and at home, but for my daughter's computer this was perfect. 
Most people don't need the full version of office, and this package has so much for so little money.
The full version of Word is reason enough to spend this amount of money. Note: This is not the latest version, but who cares.
I would say this is one of the best software deals out there. Unless you need 100% office compatiblity, this is the package for you. If you do, buy the student and teacher version of MS Office. Read the fine print, it is for anyone not using it for business
