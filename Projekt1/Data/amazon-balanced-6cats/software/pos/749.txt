It seems no longer possible to buy MS Word as a stand-alone program so to get it one buys Microsoft Works Suite.  This way one gets Word one version back from the most current version - plus Encarta, Streets and Trips, etc.  When purchasing be sure to distinguish between the CD version and the DVD version.  The latter comes on a single disk; the former on about six.  Also, note this is not the same as Microsoft Works - a suite of programs often preloaded on a new computer.  It has its own "peculiar" word processor, spreadsheet, etc.  For more than Word, look for the Student and Teacher Edition of MS Office Suite
