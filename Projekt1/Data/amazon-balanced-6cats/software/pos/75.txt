I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old.  Wanted to update.  I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features.  Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing.  Otherwise it's a wonderful program.  Highly recommended!!
