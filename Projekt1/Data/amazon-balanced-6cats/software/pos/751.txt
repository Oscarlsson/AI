I am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of Excel, Word etc. Opening up files - it tends to be a bit sluggish.  On the plus side I found Word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents.  In Word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us.
