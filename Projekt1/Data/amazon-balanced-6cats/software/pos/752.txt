Office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions.  The program was stable, for me at least, and the new interface was very nice.  It may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface.  One thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default.  There is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option isn't compatible with earlier programs
