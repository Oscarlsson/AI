Wow! I must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003. It did take some time to get the hang of it because Microsoft changed around the icons and buttons. However, I do like it because now in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide. In the end, I think the 2007 is much more user-friendly than 2003. I recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the NEW 2007 Microsoft Office
