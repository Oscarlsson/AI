A quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running.  I've been able to do most of the things I've wanted to do with this program and it's delivered on most of its promises.  My wife loves it too.

I have to remind myself that I'm not an architect and this isn't a professional program, though.  It does most things really well but it has some short comings.

I'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and haven't had any luck yet.  Although I've net seen all tutorials, I'm doubtful the program can do it at all.  Foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best.

My planned home addition includes a home theater and I've had to use work-arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls.  (Which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator.)  But it has let me put in chairs, speakers, and a projector screen which makes the 3D views very close to what the finished product may look like.

The framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose.

So as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy.  Basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and I've had a blast planning our addition.  I can't imagine designing our addition/remodel without it.

I would buy it again
