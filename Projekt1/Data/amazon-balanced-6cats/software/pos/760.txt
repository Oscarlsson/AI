The engine behind this program is from Chief Architect, who, from what I understand, are developers of professional CAD software. It shows in this program. 

While this program has one of the best 3D walk around and capabilities, I tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses. And this one has some good usable tools. 

Like most consumer level landscaping programs, this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home. Unlike other programs, the BHG software allows you to import and mask your own plant images. This is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use. 

All the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there. For now, and with the choices I know of that are available to you, I find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there. 

This design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial CD. It was easy to install and start using right away. I think most folks would do quite well with this one.
