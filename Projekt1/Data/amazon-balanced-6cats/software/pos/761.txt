I'm 9 years old and play this game frequently. I love to play it. It's not frustrating at all and it's totally exciting with many adorable animals. I didn't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then I bought a dresser and changed her outfit. The Pigs are fun to treat!!!!! They're smart!! The rabbits are soft and adorable; having my favorite animal being rabbits. I play this game for at least a half an hour a day and can't wait for the next time playing it!!!!

Get this game and try it out!! It's the best!
