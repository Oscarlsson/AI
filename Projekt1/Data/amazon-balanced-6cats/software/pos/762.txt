I did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly, but it's a fantastic game. 

You get a building with your waiting room, exam room, living room, and bedroom. You build animal pens outside, buy medical equipment, buy books to learn about caring for each species, and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals, sleep, eat, and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed, care for, play with, and clean up after. 

It's a fun and well designed game
