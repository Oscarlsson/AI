I have my own ATI primium TV tuner card so I tried the trial version on this software. But I realized that once one software is using a TV Tuner Card, it is difficulty to use the same device for other applications.

So, I purchased the full version of MY-IPTV which came with a USB 2.0 external device. So, I can also use it on my laptop notebook. I like this a lot.

This company boasts the feature to watch TV away from home. But I was very happy that I can watch TV from any computer at home as long as I have MY-IPTV in one of my desktop or stationary PC.

I would recommend this to folks who wathc TV on their PC or want to watch on PC like other techy guys out there.
I guess this turns your LCD monitor into a LCD TV.
