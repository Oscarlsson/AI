I'm very impressed with how non intrusive this software is.  I used Norton for approximately 5 years before I changed to Bit Defender.  I didn't realize how bogged down my system was until I made the change.  The system scan is very quick (approx. 8-10 minutes in comparison to 20-25 minutes from Norton).  I don't even notice when the software is updating.  I'm very pleased with the program thus far and I highly recommend it
