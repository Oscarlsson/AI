When my virus protection was about to expire, I was in a quandary.  I wasn't at all happy with the Norton I had purchased last year.  And, I wasn't especially pleased with the McAfee I had used the year before that.  When I checked the local stores, there didn't seem to be anything else to choose from.  I checked Amazon and found more options, plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide.  My son told me that BitDefender had been given the highest rating by Consumer Reports.  That, together with other customer comments on Amazon, helped me decide to give it a try.  So far, I'm delighted with its performance.  In fact, when I first installed it, it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that Norton never caught.  It doesn't appear to be interferring with my system operations (unlike Norton and McAfee), it and doesn't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings.  The best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys
