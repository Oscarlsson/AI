The last reviewer didn't see any point to this software. Partially that's true---you don't need it to create your photostamp, you can do the same thing online. However, there is one big plus to the software product: buying a single sheet of PhotoStamps direct from their website costs $24.99 + $2.99 shipping, at this writing. In contrast, Amazon is selling this "boxed" version ---which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps---for seven bucks less than that. Do the math
