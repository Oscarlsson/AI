I own this program and for 20 bucks, it's outstanding.  Depending on what you want to do, you need to know that there are limits though.  If you want to just drop screenshots from your PC Game and make your own story, it's awesome.  If you want to drop your own photos or mess with the provided clipart, you can do that with ease as well.  If you want to make your own comic with your own pictures, that can get a bit tricky.  You need an art program like Photoshop, or scan your own drawings into the computer and put them in the clipart folder.  Then you can use them as inserts into the panels or as clipart, which allows you to overlap the panels a bit for a semi professional layout.  I have been working on a 24 page comic for a couple months (I have a wife and kid so there are limits to my time) and it's coming out quite nicely.  Now granted, this is not going to get you any contracts or deals with publishers but it's fun.  And anyone who loves comics and has wanted to make one of their own come to life, this is the key.
