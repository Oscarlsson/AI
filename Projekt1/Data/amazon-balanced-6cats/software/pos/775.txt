Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac. 
I used MYOB--a Mac accounting program--but found it to be tricky and didn't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that I expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours.  It could be that I didn't understand the program well enough, but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help, so no thanks MYOB.  In fact, I put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until January 2007 because I dreaded trying to figure out MYOB again.  
Then I broke down and bought Quickbooks for Mac.  It did everything I needed it to--a year's worth of accounting in a weekend and I never even cracked the manual.  It allowed me to save the year as a PC file to hand to my accountant on a CD.  A few days later he handed me back a CD with a Mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent.  
I can't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because I never got that deep into the program, but for my needs it's right on the money.
