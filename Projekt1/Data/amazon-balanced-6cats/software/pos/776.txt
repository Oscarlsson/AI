I'm currently learning how to use this product; however, one of the first things I noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a SERVICE.  Now of course, this SERVICE wasn't free and with only 4 employees, the last thing I wanted to do was expend $20 a month on a SERVICE.  Wasn't that the point of getting Quickbooks - so I could do it myself?

Now I can understand that tax codes, percentages, etc can vary from state to state, but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks.  See, I'm not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts.  Simple would have been fine with me.

As for the rest of the program, it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after I figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business.

I'm disappointed that a Business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll
