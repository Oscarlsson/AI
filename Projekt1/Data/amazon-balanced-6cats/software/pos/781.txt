I teach presentation skills, so I'm always on the lookout for things that make PowerPoint better.  I've tried and recommended other software in the past, but none of them have the power of Ovation.

This is an outstanding piece of software.  The visual effects are stunning, and it's so easy to use that a child could learn it in a few minutes.  PowerPoint is boring, and everyone's presentations look the same.  Not any more!  Full-motion backgrounds and effects really jazz up your presentations, and they have over 100 professional-looking business themes available.  See their website (seriousmagic dot com) for a demonstration of what it can do.  All you have to do is drag and drop your PowerPoint presentation on the Ovation icon, choose a theme and the effects, and voila! - a new presentation!

The current version 1.0 can not process embedded video or audio files, but they say that will be fixed with the first patch within the next month or two.  Despite that shortcoming, this is the best PowerPoint enhancement available - heads and shoulders above the competitors
