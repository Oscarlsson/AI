MS put Office 2007 on a DVD rather than a CD so there is only one disk, so they make the installation easier right off the bat. Unlike all previous versions of Office, you do not have to get into the details of what options you want. In previous versions, if you didn't make sure you installed all the features, when you went to do a function that wasn't installed, you had to dig out your Office disks and install the feature. A huge pain, but not anymore.

The installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of Office. You don't have to tell it manually where to find your files. You don't have to manually put in your favorite buttons. It's all done for you. Yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions, but once you figure them out, it is so nice and smooth. This version is light years better than all previous versions.

The most impressive part of the installation is Outlook 2007. In all previous versions, you had to EXPORT and IMPORT all your files and Contacts. Anyone who experienced this, knows that it never went that smooth. Sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and Contacts in the transfer, and the time it took to do this, was very painful. This is not the case with Outlook 2007. Just load the program and it does all the transfers  from your previous version of Outlook. You don't have to do a thing, and you're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading. You will be shocked how simple it is.

Anything new has it's growing pains to learn, but once you do, you will be very glad you made the change
