I've been using this since the first beta release, and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles.  The ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used, and my old keystroke commands are still there as well.  After changing my default save setting to 97-2003 I have run into no compatibility problems.  

As with most of the bad reviews on MS products, it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past.  My advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus...  They make sense, and once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to the old way again.  Everything is cleaner, smoother, faster, and easier to use than ever before, and I have been using Office for longer than I care to admit.  Let go of the past people!  This is the future of business productivity
