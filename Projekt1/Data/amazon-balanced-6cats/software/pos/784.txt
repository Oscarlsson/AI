The new office 2007 is completely revamped from older versions and is well worth the four year wait.

+'s
1.New Interface with improved accessibility to all features, you can reach all the features that were hidden away inside those menus and no need to memorize the menu contents/options.
2. If you are a developer you can write your own custom panes using Visual Studio.
3. Great Plug-ins (like the save as PDF/XPS thing available as a free dwnld), massive clip-art/template library.

-s
1.Overpriced by about 40%. Somwhere around 250-300 wud have been the right price for the Pro Edition.
2. Some backward compatability issues with the document formats and templates and doesn't work with Adobe Acrobat as of now
