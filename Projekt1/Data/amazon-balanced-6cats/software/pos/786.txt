I have a new Compaq PC - AMD Athlon 64, 1/2-gig ram, 200+GB HDD - and NIS-2005 came pre-installed. It worked and continues to work fine for me - and I am able to get all my updates regularly w/o any problems. However I am a single desktop user with normal needs - not a power user. That, and if you have a high-end PC - then this product should be quite adequat
