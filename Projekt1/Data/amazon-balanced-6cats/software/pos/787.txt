I am enjoying the Talk Now! Learn Bulgarian CD. Great images, repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words, numbers, time, etc. easy. Also, the games add interest. You can print out each section with photos and words in Bulgarian. However, I would have liked to see the program come with the Cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide.
