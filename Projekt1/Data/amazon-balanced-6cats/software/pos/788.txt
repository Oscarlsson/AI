I purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal (nonbusiness) matter, so the noncommercial license was fine for my "home" use.  Good thing I checked with Corel after buying it and seeing the "Home Edition" captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the "WordPerfect" and "Quattro Pro" components (inside front box folding cover with velcro).  Corel ultimately confirmed to me that "certain components that are designed for the business customer, such as Legal Tools, MetaData Removal, Document Compare, Quickfinder to name a few are not included in the Home Edition version."  Corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the "Home Edition."  I focused on the word processing application, but the Quattro Pro application is also captioned as "Home Edition" so it may be missing some features available in the Quattro Pro included in other Suite versions (Standard, Pro, Student/Teacher, etc.).  The Home Edition may still be suitable for some users, but I'm a strong believer in "full disclosure."  WordPerfect itself is a great program.  Try setting point sizes with decimals in Word -- you can't.  Try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in Word -- there's no direct control of it (the Microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get Word to adjust the font size) [but remember, you need any WordPerfect version other than Home Edition to get Legal Tools]
