This was my second purchase of a product like this and I loved it. The first one I tried was difficult to use. It was so easy to use. My husband and I were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed. It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage
