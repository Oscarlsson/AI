Looked at them all and then bought this software... it can do a lot of things so, yes, it might take a bit to learn and get fast with. 

There is a reason it has been voted best for several years now. It does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying,
"Garbage IN...Garbage OUT" 8-)  

My wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she's working on.

Anything this complete, is worth the learning curve
