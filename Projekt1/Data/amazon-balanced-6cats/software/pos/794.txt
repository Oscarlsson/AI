I recently  purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom.  Compared to other products that I have evaluated, Punch! Interior Design Suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility, stability, and 3D.  It includes many precision, dimension, and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs.  Using the split 2D/3D mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors.  After I completed the drawings I showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as I had envisioned them.  Like most software I have used, this package does contains a learning curve.  I by no means consider myself a computer guru and I had to put in a little practice time.  You will find, however, a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual/tutorials to assist you with your project
