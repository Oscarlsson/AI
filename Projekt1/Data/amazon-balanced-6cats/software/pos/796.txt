It installed without any problems.  It runs without any problems. I am very happy with it. 

I am a convert from Microsoft Money.  I am self employed and have one employee.  My wife is also self-employed.  We have twenty different financial accounts (investment accounts, retirement accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, a mortgage, a home equity line of credit and credit cards).  We often pay business expenses with our personal credit card, as the credit card gives us frequent flyer miles for every purchase.  Quicken 2007 Home and Business allows us to do our personal accounting and business accounting all in one program, which makes it much easier.  

The one step update (automatic downloading of our transactions and balances from financial institutions) works with 17 of our 20 accounts.  Downloading data from the other 3 accounts requires some manual steps, but is still fairly painless.

I like the online backup feature. It is inexpensive (you pay a small annual charge) and easy to use.

I am not very impressed with the investment analysis features, although I have not yet fully explored them.  I would like to be able to compute realized and unrealized annualized rates of return for individual positions or groups of positions, and it doesn't seem like I can do that in this program.
