I believe it is important to say that I am a QuickBooks ProAdvisor. As a technical consultant to small businesses, I began supporting QuickBooks several years ago after I saw how it benefited my clients.

I began useing QuickBooks myself in 1999 for my business. This version is one of the best advances I have seen. The new home page shows the various work-flows in an easy to understand format, making it easy to get to the form I need with one click. I really like the new "Centers" for customers, vendors and employees. Most of the information I need when looking for history with a customer or vendor is available when I click on the customer or vendor name. With one more click I can easily see the original transaction. I used to have to go through several screens to get to the information I needed.

The industry customization in the Premier Edition is a great addition and well worth the additional investment. I have a client using the Contractor Edition. The Contractor Center provides a quick glance at how the business is doing. The Job Cost reporting is an excellent tool to help better manage the business by comparing actual to estimated costs. They have been able to improve their estimates based on the information QuickBooks makes available to them.

The key to having the information you need is to make sure you get it setup properly in the beginning. Spend some time reviewing the excellent on-line training and help before you setup your company files. If you don't like reading the instructions, another option would be to get the help of a local QuickBooks ProAdvisor for assistance.

I highly recommend it.
