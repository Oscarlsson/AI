I am a solo family medicine physician and have been using the Quickbooks Pro series since 2003.  At first, I was a little upset with being forced to upgrade my QB Pro 2003, however once I installed the new Premium 2006, I must say I am very pleased.

From the beginning, everything has changed just a small bit, however in a very good way.  In my past version of QB Pro 2003, I had to toggle between different screens in order to move from deposits to writing checks, etc.  In Premium 2006 this is no longer the case.  A very easy to use and intuitive home page shows everything you need to use.  Each different tool is one simple click away.  I very much like the new enhanced payroll option in that I can now print out my state tax forms along with my federal forms.  In the past, it would take an hour or two out of my family time in order to fill in those little boxes and double check each figure with my CPA.  Now I print out each form and am finished in less than 10 minutes.

I would highly recommend this product to any solo or small group practice.  The versatility and power found in Quickbooks Premium allows me to keep track of my finances personally.  The added convenience of the payroll services just makes this product an even better buy.  Yes, there are enough subtle differences between the Pro and Premium version to justify spending a few extra dollars.  I would definitely buy this software title again
