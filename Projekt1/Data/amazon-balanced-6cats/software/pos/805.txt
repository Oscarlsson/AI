For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual.

I've seen Acronis True Image recommended by some both here and elsewhere. I've tried Acronis and find it lacking in one major respect: It simply is not reliable. During trials, I made backups with Acronis. Acronis indicated that the backups were successful but, when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later, Acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used. The backups were worthless.

When purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles don't count for anything. The only thing that counts is reliability. It must be able to reliably restore your system. Norton Ghost passes that test with flying colors.
