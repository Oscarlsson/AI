I have every single (that I know of) Math Blaster game out there. My kids love them all. I saw this one and couldn't resist buying it. My 12, 10, and 7 year-olds all play this version. (It's too simple for the 12 year old, but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so I'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills.) My thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs, and that's ususally right where they're at. Yes, there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and cannot move around (I don't play them myself to know well) but I would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much. I think every family should have Math Blaster Geometry, Algebra, and all grade levels. If you can make math fun, and use it as a POSITIVE REWARD...that is called a "win win"! :
