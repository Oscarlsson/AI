I have tried other systems before and they took the "long way around" about getting to the Rock and Roll stuff I wanted. This one however jumps straight into what I wanted to know about ROCK guitar. The teaching method is fantastic. The program shows not only where notes would fall but includes a "virtual fret board" so I can see exactly what to play. This feature includes a "slow" version to start with then a normal speed version that (in almost every case) is exactly like the song being heard. I have played guitar (that is fooled with guitar) for about twenty years this program got me playing and learning every day for a couple hours. Now I have much more fun jamming and playing songs I have heard. I recommend this for anyone beginners to intermediate
