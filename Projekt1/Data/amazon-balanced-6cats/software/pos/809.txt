I have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now. I decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar I recieved as a gift. It's a pretty good method. Sometimes a bit difficult to work with, but you do learn some things. I stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when I realized that I had a bass amp. So make sure you have all the right equipment, and I would have to say that this might be easier for someone who's taken guitar lessons.
