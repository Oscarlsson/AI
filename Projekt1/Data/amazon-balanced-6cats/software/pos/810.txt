I picked this up for my twelve year old son.  He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks.  The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it.   It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.    

Great Product!  I reccomend it
