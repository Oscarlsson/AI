Though I've odered many times with Amazon, this is the first time I have been excited enough to review a product!  I'm an adult who wants to learn guitar for fun and didn't want to play "Mary had a little lamb" and scales for months.  I have only used the software for about an hour, and have already been playing parts of songs I actually like!  I have been playing guitar for a total of one week prior to receiving this (without any instruction).This is perfect if you don't have the patience or desire to learn the traditional way.  I wish I had this when I was 14, I would have loved it.

I can't vouch for the whole thing yet, since I've only played with it for an hour, so I give it 4 stars instead of five.  From what I've seen I have no reason to expect that it will let me down and highly recommend it
