This is a good computer Bible, but for the money, I prefer a program like AMG Bible Essentials which has the Libronix Library System built-in and can be integrated with other Bible study software.  For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc.  The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above.  Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV
