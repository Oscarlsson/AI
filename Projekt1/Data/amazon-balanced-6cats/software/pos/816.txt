I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime.

I normally do not like Bibles that do not have the words of Christ in red but this Bible is sensational.  I love it!!!! I like the way it gives an overview of each book of the Bible.  The colorful maps and illustrations make this Bible beautiful.  At the end of the Bible there are 365 memory verses to be learned each day.  So not only is studying emphasized but learning scriptures is also emphasized.

This Bible is wonderful for individuals who are new to reading the Bible.  I would highly recommend geting this Bible as a gift for a new convert or seasoned veteran in the Gospel who is interested in in depth study.  Reading this Bible is fun.
