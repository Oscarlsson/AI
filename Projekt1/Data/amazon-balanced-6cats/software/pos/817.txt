ISBN-1581700296 Black Leather Non-Indexed KJV

This is a beautiful bible. Every verse is colored and each color stands for something such as Love, Family, Faith, Salvation, etc. It also has the center column reference, a one year bible reading schedule, a daily verse lisiting with, of course, 365 verses, one for each day of the year, various maps and pictures, outlines of each book, and a list of 100 popular bible verses, 50 from the old testament and 50 from the new. There is also a section in the front of the book that explains the color system and gives examples as well. It is also available in NIV as well as KJV. 

I'd highly suggest this bible to anyone, but shop around. The one I bought listed at amazon for $77.99 but I bought it at a local bookstore for $39.99 plus tax. Same book, same ISBN exactly.
