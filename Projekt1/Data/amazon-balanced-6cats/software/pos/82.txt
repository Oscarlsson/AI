I am teaching myself Japanese. I want to learn more languages. I learned German, French, and Korean. I want to learn Korean. Because I have a friend who speaks Korean. This software is very awesome!!! This can really help students who are taking French or Spanish to get a good review. 

If you find a language you want to learn from this software... good luck with your studies and have fun
