Photoshop CS 2 is in a league of it's own. It can be used to do professional photo retouching and correcting but it is also probably the best painting package out there. It's not perfect however. There are some features that high end compositing and color grading programs like Inferno and DaVinci have that Photoshop could use, and the warper is just bare bones but then we're talking big bucks and no doubt Photoshop will eventually have something like them. Except for a few filters, it can function in 16 bits per channel which was a long time coming but now it's here, making it a professional product. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate paint program has yet to be written
