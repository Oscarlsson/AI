I was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program.  Setting up the query parameters is easy & the amount of info concerning places of interest (services, banks, transportation) is substantial.  About the only drawback I found was the quality of the help contents, which was not very user friendly.  Most of the time I was unable to find solutions to my question/problem because the data was way too complicated (displaying data in technical equations) or was not listed at all.  However, calls to technical support usually resolved the questions.  Finally, I was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map (ie: a listing of addresses for your push pin locations).  Other than that, the program is very handy, loaded with tons of great data & the quality of the maps is superior.
