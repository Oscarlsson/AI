Absolutely love this program. I'd been using Norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch. Its not as user friendly as Norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted. On the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity, making it an exceptionally good security program.
