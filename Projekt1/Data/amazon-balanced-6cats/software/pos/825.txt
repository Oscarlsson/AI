Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like.
