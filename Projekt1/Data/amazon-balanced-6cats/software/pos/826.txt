I've been using this for several years without ever having a problem. I like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before. It uses less system resources than Norton plus I know people that have gotten viruses using Norton & McAfee. Kaspersky always rates in the top three. The only drawback is there is no anti spyware but I don't feel that is an issue. Let them worry about viruses & such & I'll continue using Webroot's Spysweeper to control spyware. Together, they make a great combo to keep my computer clean
