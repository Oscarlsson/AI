I have used MS WORKS from about the time it was born, when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable. But I have continued to use it, primarily for databases, because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use.  These are not all small and simple databases--many include several thousand items, each with 20 to 30 fields of data.  It is easy to &quot;find&quot; single items or to assemble groups of items (&quot;filter&quot;), and to print customized reports.  So if you don't need (or want) the super sophistication of ACCESS, I have found WORKS to be a friendly and helpful--and inexpensive--alternative
