This is really good software.  I own CAD software, but it doesn't do what Punch Home Design can do.  It has a bit of a learning curve, but if you take the "step by step" tutorials, you'll find it much easier to learn.  I did a module of the tutorial (there are several), then I saved that drawing as "test" and loaded my own and did the appropriate things to it.  By going back and forth, I got to use the steps being taught several times which made it easier to remember "how" to do that thing.  If you're planning to remodel (that's what I'm doing) or building from scratch, this software will give you a real good idea of what your completed remodel or construction will be like.  It will more than pay for itself by saving you from making a costly mistake
