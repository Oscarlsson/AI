It is the coolest game about horses. It teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses. It is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from Mom or Dad should be welcome, even though my daughter found things that I did not, it's a team effort at the beginning. After that it's just very pleasurable, and can go on for ever. According to my daughter it is very addictive (!!) and she has already Dreamer and Lets ride. OK it's not high visual 3D as the others, but let's face it, a lot more entertaining.
In all it is a real cool game, and worth the 5 stars. Perfect gift, and good for Mom and Dad also...
