At first I didnt like this game because of the graphics but once I learned how to play I really thought it was fun one time I was so interested that I woke up at 8:00am and played the whole game to 11:00pm
If you are a horse lover and know some amount about horses you will love this game if you do NOT like horses you might still like it but I dont know because I am a major horse lover so here are some things in the game-

-feed and groom your horse every day.

-keep practicing your riding skills you could make it to the championships

-they will giveyou tasks to do for instance "breed a horse".

- you can go to the breeders office to breed a horse or you can own a stallion and a mare and buy the breeding pasture and breed them yourselves

          If you buy this item I hope you have fun with it and hope my review was helpful to you.
