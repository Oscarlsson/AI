Every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to.  The Snapstream remote is one of them.

I just recently built a home theater pc through which I play music and movies. However, the HTPC is in a different room than my projector and I needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room.  I chose the Snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased.

I also highly recommend the Snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the Beyond TV PVR solution.  I record all my favorite TV programs on my HTPC in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the Snapstream remote.

This is one product that I can recommend with no reservations
