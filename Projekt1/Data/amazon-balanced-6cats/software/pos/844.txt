This remote works really well and it's easy to create your own profiles for whatever application you use, or to customize it however you want.  There is a good user community that is doing a lot of cool things with the Firefly.  Set up is simple and the range is good.  It "just works."  

The only suggestion is that the buttons are not backlit so it's hard to use in the dark.  Adding to that problem is that the remote is pretty much symmetrical so you can be holding it upside down and not really realize it.  If it weren't for that I'd give it five stars, and if they came out with a version that had backlit buttons I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade
