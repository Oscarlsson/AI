I've had this PC remove for 1 year and I have used it everyday that I am home and I have not yet changed the remote batteries.  My PC has suddenly become more entertaining and useful.  With this remote, the time I spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced.

In my 860 sq ft APT, the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft.  The remote has always worked from anywhere in the APT thru 2 walls. I was surprised to get this much range. I have not yet found a spot from which it doesn't work.  To get the best range BE SURE to position the USB RF receiver near the computer as directed.

With my PC, I'm always playing music.  I also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the Internet.  I have a good graphics card with S-Video TV out.  I got a 50 ft S-Video/Out cable; this connects my PC and TV which are in different rooms.  

With this remote, I now can play (and control) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo (which is connected to the TV) without being at my PC or be in the same room as my PC.  Also, with this remote, any video that can be played on my PC, (online streaming or local) I can watch and control it (pause, rewind, slow motion, next, FWD) on my TV.  

My PC/TV has effectively become a powerful media center--Media center PC not needed.   

There is so much more...  with the remote, I use the mouse from far away (lying in bed or on the couch); there a numerous ways to get creative with this.

I wish the remote was lighted. Still, the keys are arranged for "touch typing" so to speak.  Another negative, I've noticed that Windows Media Player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote.
