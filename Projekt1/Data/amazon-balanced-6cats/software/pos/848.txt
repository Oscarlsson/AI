I purchased this Firefly remote a month ago to work with my PC-PVR (I have got a Hauppauge PVR-250 card and BeyondTV 3).  As my computer and TV set are in different rooms, I thought it would be convenient to have an RF remote control so that I can still control video recording/playback while sitting in front of my TV. RF signals can usually travel a longer distance, and most importantly, they can penetrate walls.

However, my first installation with the Firefly remote was not a totally success.  It functioned well, but I have only measured a 6-foot of workable distance - with full battery power, and no blocking objects or interference sources nearby.  I thought either I had a defective item, or the product was not as good as they said.

I contacted Snapstream for support, and they suggested to try a different USB port or use a powered USB hub for plugging receiver.  My computer has 6 USB ports - 4 in back and 2 in front, all built on the motherboard.  I was using a front USB for the measurement.  After I switched to an USB port in back, everything becomes perfect.  I have learned that even all being built on the same motherboard, USB ports can be different, which may provide different power levels for external devices.

Now my Firefly works great for my application, which is about 13 feet of transmission distance and with a wall (and some blocking objects as well) inbetween.  Firefly remote can even perform the job of a mouse.  Although it may not be as fast and convenient as a real mouse, it comes in handy for quick-and-easy controls. For the convenience the Firefly remote brings, I give it 5 stars!
