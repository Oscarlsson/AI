have been using acrobat since v3,v4,v6.  v8 is in line. seems a bit faster, smoother etc.  have tried imitations on other machines.  from a purely subjective view, acrobat is best.  a bit pricey, but the best. with the usual caveats, can be installed on a desktop and a notebook, but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth
