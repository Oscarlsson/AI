Installed on Windows XP with no problem and have already done an e-file before the "mid-Feburary" update mentioned by others.  No problems with either.  Having used TurboTax for 6+ years, I had been led to believe that TaxCut was inferior to TurboTax.  I was pleased to discover that TaxCut is just as good as TurboTax and it's cheaper too!  It also includes a rebate for a free Federal e-file, something that Intuit quietly has removed from this year's TurboTax.  I plan to use TaxCut from now on
