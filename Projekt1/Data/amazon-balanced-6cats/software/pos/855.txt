I think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning. However, it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program. In order to get the most out of the program I feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level/lesson.
