I fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version.  When Ancestry updated this year I decided I had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on Ancestry so purchased this version.  I was very pleasantly surprised and happy.  I am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info I have entered incorrectly but I would certainly recommend it.  The online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome
