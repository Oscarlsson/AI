I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit. The maps look good although i havn't noticed much change from version 2005. There are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated. A little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going. It has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use. The phonebook is very nice!
