I am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru, but based on my experience with this product I am very satisfied.  I love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease.  I have only used it for a month now and I still have to use some of the applications yet.  If you have the money and will love to have a new Office Suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day, go for it
