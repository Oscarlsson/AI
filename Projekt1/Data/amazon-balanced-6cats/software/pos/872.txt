Excellent product.  The 'over $450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value.  During installation, the 1 year free trial to [...] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support.  Ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their US Deluxe product over the phone and didn't ask for a credit card number for renewal.  To me, that's a sign that they're a reputable company.  Some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation CD but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the GenSmart software.
