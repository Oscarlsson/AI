The product of Windows XP- Professional is just what I was looking for with many updated features and I am looking forward in using it daily.  It was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it.  But most of all, Service was "top knotch".  I could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems I may have had. Customer service is a plus. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller
