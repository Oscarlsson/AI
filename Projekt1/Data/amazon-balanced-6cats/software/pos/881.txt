First off, for people who are complaining  about installing Windows 2000, it only took my approx. 6 1/2 hours! I love it because every time I launch Internet Explorer it freezes! I also love that theres 42 spyware programs and 78 tojans on my harddrive before I even hooked up my internet. The one thing I love the most though is that I can download any movie I want. Like the recently video game adapted film Mortal Kombat! It was at full quality on my 28.8k modem and it took about 3 minutes. The blue sceen of death happens so often i just went ahead and set it as my desktop and my screensaver. I also bought the separate Ctrl Alt Del accesory pad, ive had it for about 2 days and i cant even tell what key is what anymore because i've used it so much. But all in all DOS has been a blessing, and i hope everyone embraces Windows 95 into their homes.
