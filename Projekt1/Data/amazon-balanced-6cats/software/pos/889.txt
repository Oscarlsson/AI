CorelDraw X3 is a fine product.  It has added some nice features from V-11.  CorelDraw came with a rebate and I must say Amazon failed big time in helping me apply for it...on line was a joke replied by e-mail 3 time never got a reponse...talked to reps 2 times they did not help....yes I got the product in 5 days....but if you have a small problem....Amazon aint gunna get R done
