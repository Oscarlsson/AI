I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8 & didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11. 

So now here we are on X3.  Let me tell you, It has been 5 years since could say I love this program! It loads faster than 11 or 12 (and about a bizillion times faster than Adobe's Illustrator). 

It seems in this version, Corel has really given it's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of "I can harldy wait to work on a new project".

 Many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts. Some, like the improved trace work wonderfully and seamlessly. You can go to corel's website to learn of the other improvments. I think you'll be pleased.  

This is a designer's tool that you can purchase and use with confidence.
