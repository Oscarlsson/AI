I've been using System Mechanic 6 Professional, for about a month. I'd have to say that the overall performance of Windows XP has improved greatly since installation. Upon starting System Mechanic, a general report is given on the overall health of Windows. It fixes problems in the registry, defragments the hard-drives/ram, and boosts internet performance. All of this is done is done in a short period of time (under an hour).

I've also read all the negative reviews on Amazon. I'm not going to dispute any of them, since each user has his/her own experiences using the product. All I can say, is that I'm glad that the software worked for me.
