You likely won't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very "messy" system. But it does have a great antivirus and firewall, and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on "behind the scenes", it's an okay product. But be very careful with the cleanup tool. It will delete some important files if you are not careful!!
