The computer game version of The Number Devil closely follows the book, as kids progress through sections on prime numbers, the Fibonacci series, Pascal's triangle, and an infinite series approaching one.  Nine of the ten games worked well for us, but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth, the arrow game.  We understood the math, but couldn't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows.  This was disappointing, because we could never reach the bonus section.  All in all, though, this is a good investment for a child, 8 or up, who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers
