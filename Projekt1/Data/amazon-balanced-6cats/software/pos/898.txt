I purchased Fix-It primarily to correct a registry problem. It was rated very highly on the PCWorld website. It did a great job. I had over 850 registry errors, corrected them and did a reorg on the registry. My computer is running beter now. The other utilities included work as advertised. I have been using Norton Systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price
