I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.

I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor X 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway.
