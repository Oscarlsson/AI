I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant
