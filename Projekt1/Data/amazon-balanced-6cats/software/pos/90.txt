I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.  

If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)
