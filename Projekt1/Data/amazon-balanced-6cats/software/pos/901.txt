This software was easy to install.  The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated.  I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me.  The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..
