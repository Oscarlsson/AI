Maybe it's because I was upgrading from an older version -- 2002 -- but I found the new features to be very good.

For example... the junk mail feature works better than any other I have used.  It was catching junk from the very beginning, and has missed very few things.  I have only had one thing put in the Junk folder that was not junk email.

Also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version.  And the Calendar is more flexible and easier to use.

Installation was seemless.  I think it might be a little overpriced, but considering how long I will keep it, it's not too bad
