Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 2, continues where the first CD left off.  Like the first CD, this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do, and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game.  

This program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies.

The CD covers some popular opening moves, middle game tactics like pins, forks, skewers and deflection, and mating strategies in end game.  With practice on this CD, you can begin to win some games, and then move on to Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 3, which is out in German, and is supposed to be out soon in English
