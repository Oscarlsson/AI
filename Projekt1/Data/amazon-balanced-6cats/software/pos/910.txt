My kids (6 and 8) are learning so much from Fritz and Chesster 2!!  In fact, my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game (from Fritz and Chesster 1).  

Today I decided to play with them (since they don't like to play against each other - they're still working on that "good sportsmanship" thing), and I let them team up against me.  I was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead, predict moves, and protect their pieces.  

However, I was the one who learned!!  They surprised me again and again by reciting strategies (move your bishops and knights out, save your Queen for the real battle, don't move your pawns willy nilly, break your oponnent's wall, etc...) they had learned from this game.

They also knew the relative value of the pieces, but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes.  For example, they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall, which they later exploited to checkmate my  king.  This was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them.

Anyway, I defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics, dialogue, and strategies.  I am sure that at some point, my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer.  

But for now I couldn't be happier with the Chesster and Fritz games!  My kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just "computer chess", but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me.  

I think I'm going to go demand a rematch :)
