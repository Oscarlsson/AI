I bought this based on the Amazon reviews.  I am extremely new at this but the software is pretty good.  The teacher is somewhat annoying and as another reviewer said, he sings over his playing way too much.  I wish there was a way to turn him WAY down and the guitar up.  It touts having over 160 lessons, but that is somewhat misleading.  I don't doubt it has over 160 pages, but I covered 23 "lessons" in about an hour.  I do like the fact that the first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions of the chords so you don't feel hung up on doing the full chords when your fingers don't  want to move to strange new positions they aren't used to.  I am using this as well as Fender's DVD for acoustic with Keith Wyatt.  The DVD is a little more challenging for me, but Keith Wyatt is much better than the guy from the eMedia software (and he doesn't feel the need to sing!!!).  Overall, I would recommend this software
