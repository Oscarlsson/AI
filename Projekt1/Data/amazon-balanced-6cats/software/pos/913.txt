Well presented, easy to follow along, and easy to revisit previous lessons.  Videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played.  Not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students.  Some of the accompanyment/singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along. Some of the material/songs may not be to everyones liking, but again, these are okay for the beginner.  The singing can be a slight destraction sometimes. I probably wouldn't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar....and I don't think most people buying it would think it's all the will every need to become a great guitar player.  I'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique. I'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful.  
Bottom line;  This is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar.
