With 20 grandkids and 3 great grandkids, I have spent many hours with them playing games on the comptuer.  Almost all of them like all types of games, but the I Spy Series is one of the most played series that I have.  The I SPY TREASURE HUNT notes ages 6 to 10 and they must have done a lot of testing to be able to devlop a game that is actually challenging and interesting for adults,  and yet can actually be played by young kids as well.  The I Spy series has always had very hight quality games, and this is at the top of the list for me.  I will warn you though, that if you play with your kids, be prepaired to surprised. My usual play is for me to help the kids search, and not find items and tell them, but if they get stuck, point out an area to look at.  With this one, I have a seven year old that was finishing finding the last 4 or five items before I could find even one of them.  Great play for everyone.  Super recommended
