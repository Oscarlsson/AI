I purchased this game for my 3 year old who already reads a little and knows her numbers well. I hoped this game would help her learn addition. She loves to play it, but several of the games require hand coordination beyond her ability (the hand cart one in particular, as noted by another reviewer), and catching bubbles. It was frustrating to me because she knew the proper answer but could not "execute" because her movements were too slow. Over time, she has improved enough to play most of the games on level one. The game is very engaging ang the graphics well-done, but the educational part is under-emphasized. The game that "teaches" addition involves frogs jumping to lily-pads and my daughter is so focused on the frogs that the addition lesson is hardly noticed
