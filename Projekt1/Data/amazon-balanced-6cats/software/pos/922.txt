I was amazed how colorful the graphics are in this game.  My 6 year took right to it and played it for 2 hours the first sitting.  She mastered level 2 pretty easy and is on to level 3.  Our computer runs windows and we have had no problems.  This is a great game to buy for the summer to keep kids up to speed between K and 1st grade
