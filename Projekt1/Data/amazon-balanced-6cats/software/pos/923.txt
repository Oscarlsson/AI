Finally, fresh new characters which are adorable. I am a converted Kutoka buyer as I have now bought a 3rd item from them. I was so impressed with the Mia Reading and Mia Language that I wanted to try this multi-subject game for my twin girls in kindergarten. This game is a great compliment to mia reading as it reinforces literacy and other subjects like math and problem solving. We haven't played with the art part yet but I still think it's a great value for the other subjects. I'm really impressed how it helps to develop their cognitive skills and patience as one of my girls has a problem with concentration but found through the problem solving activities that she is overcoming these difficulties. Great product. Even my neighbours kids come over to play it!
