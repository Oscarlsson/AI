(Responding to Joel G's review below)

It's unfortunate that your child was unable to enjoy Didi & Ditto because of a technical problem you had with your computer. The majority of Didi & Ditto players are running Microsoft Windows and enjoying this great educational software.

If you send us an e-mail message at service@kutoka.com, I am sure that someone from our technical support team will be able to help you resolve the issue you seem to have experienced with your computer display.

Also note that all activites can be unlocked in the Activities menu by pressing the F6 key on your keyboard. A full list of the game's keyboard shortcuts can be found in the user's guide which is accessible from the Start menu.

Hope this helps
