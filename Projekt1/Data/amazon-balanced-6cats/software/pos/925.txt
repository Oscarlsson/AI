My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  He has really enjoyed playing it so far.  He can do most of the activities without help.  There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain).  There are many different learning activities:  matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did.  We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP
