Adobe Standard 8.0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions. If you do research and want a better interface, design and functions then you need this new version of Adobe. It is an incredible tool for gathering, sorting, copying and formatting information. It also is faster than older versions. See details (above) on Amazon. Recommended for all information-knowledge workers
