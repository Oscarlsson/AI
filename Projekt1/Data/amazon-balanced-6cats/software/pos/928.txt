The operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer.  But, obviously, if you want a computer with more security features or networking features, you should go with Windows XP Professional.  At the time that I am writing this, which is a long time from when I purchased Windows XP, it is a time where Windows Vista is emerging.  If you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer, I recommend Windows XP Home/Professional (based on your requirements).  But if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast, try Windows Vista.  But one word of warning about Vista, the User Account Control (UAC) is a pain in the butt
