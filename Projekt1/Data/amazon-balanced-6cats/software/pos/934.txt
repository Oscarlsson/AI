It was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade Word and Excel, and to get Virtual PC (for Access) as well. I used them a lot on my PC a few years ago, and when I first switched to Mac, couldn't find software that did what they did. I had no trouble installing the upgrade on my iMac G5, nor did I have trouble installing Virtual PC. The only thing that WAS disappointing was that I couldn't find out whether accessing the Internet from Virtual PC would open me up to PC-type viruses, or if Mac's Unix system would protect me there, too.  I continue to be disappointed that the Mac version of this software is not as rich as the PC version. But the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do
