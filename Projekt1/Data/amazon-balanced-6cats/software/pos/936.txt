The Rosetta Stone language software was a great investment. The product provides learning words together with listening, seeing, and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases. It provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace. The product has been worth it's hefty price. I do recommend purchasing a German/English dictionary to accompany the  software. I have also had in the past a basic German 101 course prior to using Rosetta Stone, so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the German language, such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings
