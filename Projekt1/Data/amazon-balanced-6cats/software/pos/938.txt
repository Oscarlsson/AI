I first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting LPs to CDs.  After a little research, I decided to try this product of the many that are out there.  This software is not expensive and for me, it does what I expected it to do.  It is easy to set up and use, and I am using it with an Audio-Technica PL120 turntable.  The first LP I converted was Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, and with this album in particular, the songs run together, i.e. there is no separation between the tracks.  This software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so I could access individual songs.  I also cleaned up some background noise with the "one click" noise reduction, and the music from this old album sounds great.  This is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately I cannot compare it to others.  What I can tell you is that it is inexpensive, easy to use, and it does what it says it will do
