I purchased this product to put 2 CDs together.  I had never attempted something like this and was a total novice.  Audio Cleaning Lab was terrific!

My one word to describe it--- simple....or maybe...effective...or maybe...straightforward...or maybe...uncomplicated...or maybe...useful...or maybe...valuable...or maybe..
