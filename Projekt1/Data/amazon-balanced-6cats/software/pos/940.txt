I came across Magix Audio Cleaning Lab about 4 years ago.  Once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.  However, I kept wondering if there were better programs out there.  I mean, really, how good can it be for $39, right?  I recently paid $75 for Sony's famed Sound Forge Studio (which is the Sound Forge program minus various some features).  I spent a lot of time with Sound Forge Studio, working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to CD.  I was happy with what I was able to accomplish with Sound Forge.  At least I thought I was happy.  I compared my work in Sound Forge Studio to the same cassette transfer I did with Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 10 (the previous iteration of this software).  Guess what?  I liked the Magix work much better.  So, I immediately purchased Audio Cleaning Lab 11 and unintalled Sony's Sound Forge Studeio from my computer.  Magix could charge $150 for this software and I would buy it in a second.  Your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software - but it is worth the effort.  

This program does the work of software costing 3 times as much.
