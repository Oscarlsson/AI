The main reason for negative reviews in the past was the extra charge for the MP3 encoder. With this version, the MP3 encoder is included. Magix has been pretty clever in designing an interface that can used quickly yet has several more advanced features you can use as you become more proficient. These include a full featured waveform editor and a very powerful sonagram (spectral) editor. Also, somewhat hidden is the ability to record 78rpm records on a 33 1/3 turntable. If you use the full set of features almost any record can be made totally free of pops and clicks. I have two very minor negatives; the amplitude scale on the track display is somewhat truncated, the declicker has so few artifacts  that I recommend always using it at the maximum setting (as opposed to the wizard and manual recommendations.) As far as PC requirements, I believe any program that does a lot of number crunching needs a fairly up-to-date processor. This one particularly so because it leaves the original audio files intact. I don't believe this is a negative as in some prior reviews. In short, I have been totally satisfied with this program's ability to make clean transfers of both 78rpm and 33 1/3 rpm records.
