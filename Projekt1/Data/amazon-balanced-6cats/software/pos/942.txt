In my opionion, Act! is clearly still the best contact manager on the market. I am not talking about a complex CRM solution, but it is a fine contact manager. I am not using the Outlook and Palm interfaces and I don't have any complains other than it is slow if you are running many programs at the same time.

The built in email features are okay, seach features are excellent. Just give it a 30 day trial and compare to Goldmine, Maximizer and others
