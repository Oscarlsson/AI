I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money. 
I purhased a new PC with this OS and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to Ultimate for $150. 
Only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products. Not excatly sure why this is microsoft's problem though. 
Regardless, this OS is the smart choice for a new PC for home use. Accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new OS. Then upgrade. Otherwise, wait till you need a new PC
