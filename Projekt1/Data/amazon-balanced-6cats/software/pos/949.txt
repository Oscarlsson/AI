I am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the Dragon software over the last eight to 10 years.  I was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product.  However, I now own version 9 and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product.  If I were still practicing law, I would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice.  Because I did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable, I purchased a wireless microphone (by Nady - which I have also reviewed) which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program.  The program required less than one-half hour of setup although I have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns.  This dictation is much more accurate than my typing, and I have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well.  My only regret is that I purchased the basic program, rather than an advanced program.  Now that I see how well the product works, I wish that I had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just English as I am fluent in Spanish and have a growing acquaintance with French.  Incidentally, I dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send e-mails, as well as dictate letters, memoranda and outlines in Microsoft word.  It may be relevant to note that I am not using an underpowered computer system.  I have an AMD dual core system with 2 MB of RAM.  I am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional
