Voice recognition software continues to improve.  I've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period.

Before investing in this software, though, check carefully the specifications of your PC.  The faster the processor and the more RAM you have, the better the results.  The software will run on the minimum specification identified, but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us.

This software is useful in many circumstances.  Many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type.  The software can be used with a range of eMail clients as well as in word processing and other software.  

You can, as it claims, obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training.  But for optimal use, and the best return on investment, consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software.  This takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits.

I'll be buying a new PC before I look at upgrading this software.

Highly recommended.
