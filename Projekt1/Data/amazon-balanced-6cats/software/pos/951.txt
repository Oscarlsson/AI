I have been aware of NaturallySpeaking for over 15 years.  We initially utilized this software to assist people with severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy to be able to have basic commands understood.  More recently five years ago I bought edition 4.0.  I found it to be frustrating when ever there was any background noise so I basically quit using it.  When I saw the 8.0 being advertised as the voice recognition software specifically for a small business atmosphere, I thought I would try it one more time.  Being a slow typist it has truly changed my life for the better.  Only 45 minutes were required to set up the speech-recognition files when the occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those and change those right at that time, I never see that same misunderstanding happening again.  I have recommended it to two friends who are buying it.  It really does allow you to sit back in your chair relax, drink your coffee and dictate reports, answer e-mail or whenever it is you might need to do.  I can't think of any $70 expenditure that has given me so much back in such a short time.  I almost always have my headset on when I'm in front of the computer because anything that involves typing or entering data I used the DragonDictate to do
