I checked the reviews on many types of dictation software before selecting Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 standard.  I recently had my wrist operated on and knew that I would be unable to write utilizing my hand for quite a while.  As an online student going to college I had to be able to participate in discussion boards and research papers daily.  This software was unbelievably easy to learn.  I followed the directions on setting it up so that the computer would recognize my voice.  I spent approximately 5 hours learning to program, and practicing before I was operated on.  I found that if I talked at my own natural speed the computer utilizing this software did an excellent job of deciphering my words.  I found the instructions very simple to follow.  Yes there were times that the computer displayed what I said incorrectly, but correcting it was extremely easy.
I was able to keep up with my class throughout the six weeks I was in a cast.  My arm is still in a brace and I'm still using the software on a daily basis.  I'm actually using the software to write this review.  I highly recommend this software to anyone that needs to write research papers or that does a lot of computer typing on a daily basis.
I am such a strong believer in the software that I know I will continue to use it even when my brace comes off.
I found the software very compatible and easy to use even to answer my e-mails quickly and efficiently.
This might be the perfect software to get for any college student.  To be able to look at research books and talk into the computer as you're looking up reference material is truly beneficial.  It was also very easy to stop Dragon software when you needed to to take a break think what you needed to write next.  All I needed to say was "go to sleep" and the microphone shuts off until you wake it out.
To sum it all up the software was very easy to use and easy to set up.  I recommend it highly.
