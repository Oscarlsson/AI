We ordered this program only two weeks before moving to Bogota, Columbia for a two year tour.  However, the Spanish Rosetta Stone taught was much higher level than the survival Spanish we needed when we arrived.  Overall we are learning the language and it is a GREAT program.  Wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing
