I have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review.  Having now had a chance to use the software, I can only say that I am almost 100% satisfied with it.  Some times, it's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons, you still can't quite grasp the concept of the word you're being taught, but other than that...

Yes, it is repetitious.  For those who want to learn another language, this is to be expected.  No, it's not a magic pill.

However, in as little as three weeks I found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about, even if my understanding of it was imperfect.

Repetition (as they say) is key, but even if it were not, dedication is absolutely required.  You can only learn if you stick with the program, and even I have been rather lax about that much.  Still, I am wholly satisfied with my purchase.  It is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though, and I really ought to be more dedicated to following it
