As the editor of the Learning Spanish Products Reviews (LearningSpanishProductsReviews) site, one of my responsibilities is to review learning-Spanish software products that are listed on Amazon. I am also a native Spanish speaker and a professional Spanish instructor. 

Rosetta Stone Spanish is a great Learning Spanish product for a child or pre-teenager that wants to learn Spanish. This software features native speakers, real-life images, and a speech recognition feature. Your child or pre-teenager will find that this software is lots of fun. But the photographs do appear to be from at least two decades ago. 

I'd actually give this product 5 stars as a tool for teaching a child or pre-teenager Spanish. But as a learning-Spanish product for an adult the effectiveness of the product really depends on whether the adult is a visual learner or not. 

My advice is for you to also experiment with some of the auditory or auditory/text based comprehensive Spanish courses sold on Amazon, and decide if you are primarily a visual or auditory (or auditory/text) learner. Even if you determine that you learn better with or an auditory Spanish course you can still get good results with Rosetta Stone Spanish, by using it to complement your main auditory home-study Spanish course. You may also find the Rosetta Stone software helpful if you're an adult that has one or more of the major comprehensive auditory courses under your belt, and now you are merely seeking to expand your vocabulary.
