I don't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it.  It is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select "test" at the beginning.  Also, it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also ...... not just the regular exercises.  Other than these two things, the program is very good
