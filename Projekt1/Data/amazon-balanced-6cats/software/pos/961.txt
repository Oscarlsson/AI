I recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the
pro version, which costs 150 more and gives more functionality.

This is a fully functioning animation software, with lots of 
interesting features. I can see no reason that a novice
animator such as I am would not be happy with this software.

I would like to see more energy put into a manual, but you 
can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers, or
google other places.  With a more robust manual, this would
be 5 stars, not 4.  It is really the reason I am reluctant
to upgrade to Pro, because I would want more lessons and
tutorials to go along with the upgrade. 

If you have an interest in animating, this is the software 
for you.
