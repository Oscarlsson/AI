Turbo Tax Deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item.
Also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return. It's very annoying to find and adjust the State Return once you have gone back into your Federal Return.
I think it is a very good product BUT they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas ESPECIALLY for the STATE RETURN
