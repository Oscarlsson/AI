This product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes.  This is the first time we've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete.  You can go back and change things or review them, it gives you a way to e-file, you can print out all the copies that you may need.  I was surprised how easy it was to use.  However it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer.  I was very happy with it
