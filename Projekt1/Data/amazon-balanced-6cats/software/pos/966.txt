My legal ofice bought this product specifically for making unfillable PDF forms fillable.  This feature works much better than we expected.  I anticipated we would have to do a lot of clean-up to make the forms useable.  That is not the case.  About 80% of the forms we run through it come out perfectly.  It seems to have trouble with forms that are really crowded with fields or have embedded fonts that we don't have access to.  Designing fillable forms from scratch used to take us hours for a simple form.  I could see most of the forms we use taking 6-8 hours each.  Running it through the FormTyper takes a few seconds.  The amount of time we save on this one task is tremendous.  We have also begin using the OCR capabilites to create digitial documents from our paper files.  The OCR seems to work really well, even with multi-generation copies.  We are very pleased with the performance of this product.
