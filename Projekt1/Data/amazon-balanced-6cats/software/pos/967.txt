This software came with a scanner I recently purchased and I decided to upgrade from the "SE"(striped edition?)that was bundled with the device. Considering the cost and what the software can do it is an amazing value. By simply using this software to re-create documents instead of retyping them is saving me more an hour or two a day. I was hesitant to puchse it based upon all the recent negative reviews, but decided with the 30 day refund policy I could try it risk free. I'm glad I did. The software worked flawlessly for me - even on 5th and 6th generation copies that were hard to read with my naked eye 
(and I don't need or wear glasses). I'm not sure what those people that were scanning books were trying to accomplish, but when I scanned some pages from an encyclopedia for my son the OCR worked great!  Try it and if it doesn't work then return it.
