I have been using OmniPage for several years at my law office and found that the OCR with this version is impeccable.  I frequently scan and OCR newspaper and magazine articles.  They are multi-column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts.  When i convert them into Word documents I seldom get any formating errors.  In fact, because the OCR is so good I have set up a batch process to run at night to OCR all the day's work so my computer resoiurces aren't being taxed when I am in the office working.  Way to go Nuance
