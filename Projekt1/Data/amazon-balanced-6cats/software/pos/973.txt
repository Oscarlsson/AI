I give the DB Pro 5 stars, but I am totally disappointed in Amazon.com and The Gamecreaters, heres why

The first thing I noticed is my box is different than that shown here... http://darkbasicpro.thegamecreators.com

I didnt recieve any of the free software stated in the link above

I cant find the 
Over 45 Demo's
Over 25 Tutorials
Over 600 Textures
Over 120 Sound Effects
900 3D Models 
That is stated here...
http://darkbasic.thegamecreators.com/

I applied the .59 upgrade patch and now my program wont start. It says its missing MSVCR71.dll file.

The original version was 1.05

I cant believe the darkbasic.com is advertising this product, yet Amazon.com is shipping some ancient version. Hopefully I will be able to resolve this issue..
