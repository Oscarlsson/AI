Purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one.  I put the new drive in a USB external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software.  In about 20 minutes and 3 mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly.  I have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup.  

The menus are easy to use making all available tasks straight forward
