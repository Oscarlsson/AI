Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.

To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.

Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
