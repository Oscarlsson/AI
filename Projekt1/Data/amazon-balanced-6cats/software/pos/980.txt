**things i liked about the program

it supports importing ojb files, that i make in different modeling programs

the walking path editor works not too bad for simulated walking

and the rigs have good looking emontions when you moves there face features


**what i found to be not so good

the tabs such as the library and keyframe bar are kind of hidden on the side because of his small they are.  

I find the slection tool in the hair room to be alittle bit annoying when trying to grow dynamic hair groups. i most of the time end up growing hair on too many facets.  

the control points are too senative, they end up twisting the body in un-natrual forms. 

the rendering takes a very long, and the rendering shader doesent always save my settings. i end up transporting the animation to another program to render faster. 

some of the cloths i cant set them up to be childern to the body parts so they end up not being connected to anything. 


i'm sure there more on my mind by i dont have much time to write up an review. just keep in mind 3d animation isnt perfectly easy. a good modeling programs to make OBJ files will go a long way.
