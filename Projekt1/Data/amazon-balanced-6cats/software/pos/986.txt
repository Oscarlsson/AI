Purchased this edition of TaxCut last week.  On WIN XP2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues.  I imported last year's data in less than a minute and I had my return completed in less than 1 hour.  This includes capital gains/losses, dividends, and AMT calculations.  It doesn't get much easier than this.
Yes, you have to download updates.  The IRS is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores.  The alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it, but wouldn't that take at least as long
