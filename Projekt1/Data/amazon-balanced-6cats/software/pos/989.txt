It is a little bit clumsey. When I go to it, instead of my cursor being in the space where I write the word for a definition, I have to place it there and that takes time. The first one of these electronic dictionaries I had (about 5 years ago) was fabulous, it was called "deluxe" and had everything, but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again.
