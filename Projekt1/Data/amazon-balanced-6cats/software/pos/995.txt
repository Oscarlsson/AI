Given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt FrontPage was a a really big help. I was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering. I didn't realize though that Frontpage isn't the cureall for making a website really. Primarily only for WEB DESIGN i.e. if you want to make a website with E-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like, you're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in ASP or PHP. But as far as Web Design goes Frontpage can take a novice a long way.
