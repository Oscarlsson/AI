I trust the information I find from Britannica and so invested in the 2007 Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.

It has something for everyone.

I use it side by side with Microsoft Encarta and together I get a more complete subject review.

I prefer the content of Britannica but for ease of use Encarta is still superior.


I look forward to Britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why I am only able to award 4 stars
