The KNN algorithm was implemented by interpret each feature, or in this case
every document, as a dimension and the feature values corresponds to the term
occurrence frequencies. Calculations of the nearest neighbors is
implemented in a non deterministic way. This because of that a point $x$ in a plane
may have neighbours with the property that they have equal distances to
$x$. If this is the case a nearest neighbor is chosen at random. Several choices
for key was tested in different runs of the algorithm to find the best $k$ for
the classification.

The pseudocode below described the implemented matlab code.
