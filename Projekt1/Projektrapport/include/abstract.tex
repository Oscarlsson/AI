\begin{abstract}
This project concerns the machine learning task text classification.	 In-domain sentimental analysis, Out-of-domain sentimental analysis and text categorization is performed and compared using five different classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, Average Perceptron, K-nearest neighbors and Support Vector Machines. The question of issue is weather there is a correlation between Out-of-domain sentimental analysis and text categorization. A slight correlation is found and discussed using Amazon data.
