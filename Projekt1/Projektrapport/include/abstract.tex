\begin{abstract}
We process a large corpus of product review articles from Amazon users and investigate correlations between the tasks of text classification and in/out-of domain sentiment analysis using five different algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, Averaged Perceptron, K-nearest neighbours and Support Vector Machines. We show that out of 6 categories, there are clear correlations between \textit{Health}, \textit{Software} and \textit{Camera} that we also motivate by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The algorithms are configured by investigating their individual dependencies on feature set size, including algorithm-specific settings for KNN and the Perceptron algorithms.
