This project concerns the machine learning task text classification.	 In-domain sentimental analysis, Out-of-domain sentimental analysis and text categorization is performed and compared using five different classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, Average Perceptron, K-nearest neighbors and Support Vector Machines. A correlation between Out-of-domain sentimental analysis and text categorization is found and discussed.
