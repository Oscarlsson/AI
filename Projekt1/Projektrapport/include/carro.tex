\textbf{Individual Page - Caroline Strandberg} \\\\
Much of the works we have done has been done together in the group. 
I have mainly been responsibly for the report and the latex design of it. This has a involved making a structure for references and building a beginning structure for the report.   
\\\\
When it comes to the implementation parts I have mainly been involved in writing the Perceptron algorithm and the Averaged Perceptron. This started from my and Oscars Perceptron algorithm from a previous course in machine learning, which I rewrote. I have also set up a some test files to calculate an appropriate choice of k-value for KNN and an appropriate choice of number of iterations for the Perceptron algorithm and the Averaged Perceptron. I was also involved in writing code to perform the classification tasks (in-domain sentiment, out-of-domain sentiment and text categorization).
\\\\
I the report I have mainly been writing the chapters about the Perceptron algorithm, Problem description, Features and the beginning text at Introduction. I have also wrote most of the Reference list and added the plots in the appendix. But everyone in the group have read the whole report and been making small changes in every chapter.
