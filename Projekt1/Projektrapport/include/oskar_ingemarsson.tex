I have been trying get involved in as much as possible in the project.
Very much have been done together in the group. This have been working
splendid and I think that this working style have benefited the project most
greatly. Since every one have touched almost every thing the credit should go to
the group. I will however try to write something about what especially I have
done in the project.

I mainly been involved in processing the raw data from Amazon and work
concerning the implementation of perceptron. When it comes to the report I
mainly been writing the problem description, representing text, feature vectors,
KNN. Every body have been proofreading each others texts and re-regulated the
structure of the report under writing part of the project.

... and much more to write
