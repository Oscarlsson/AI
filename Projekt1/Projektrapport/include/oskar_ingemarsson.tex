I have been trying get involved in as much as possible in the project.
Very much have been done together in the group. This have been working
splendid and I think that this working style have benefited the project most
greatly. Since every one have touched almost everything the credit should go to
the group. I will however try to write something about what especially I have
done in the project.
\\\\
I mainly been involved in the processing the raw data from Amazon and work
concerning the implementation of perceptron. When it comes to the report I
mainly been writing the problem description, representing text, feature vectors
and KNN. Every body have been proofreading each others texts and re-regulated the
structure of the report under writing part of the project.
\\\\
The project benefited much from the fact that all members of the group have
already taken a course in machine learning. This means that the concepts of
machine learning were already clear before the project started. This
gave rise to that we could focused the work on how we should process the data
and how we should interpret the results between different algorithms and
distinguished input.
\\\\
I think the above facts resulted in an interesting project and much fun to be a
part of the group.
