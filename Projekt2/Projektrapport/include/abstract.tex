\begin{abstract}
This project is inspired by a Phd project called SHRDLU and concerned implementing a dialogue system for a robot in a two-dimentional blocks world. The system involved a parser to translate the input into a goal state and a planner to make a planning of how to reach the specified goal state. The robot is then able to move the blocks in the world, according to the planning. The planner is an implementation of the search algorithm A*.

We are able to parse four example inputs with an effecient planning.
