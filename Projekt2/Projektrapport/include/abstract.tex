\begin{abstract}
This project is an implementation of a dialogue system for a robot in a two-dimentional blocks world, inspired by a PhD thesis called SHRDLU. The system consists of a parser to translate the input into a goal state and a planner to make a planning of how to reach the specified goal state. The robot is then able to move the blocks in the world, according to the planning. The planner is an implementation of the search algorithm A*. Our ambition was to parse and to make and perform a planning for a preselected amount of input strings, which we managed to do.
