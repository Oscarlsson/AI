\section*{Caroline Strandberg}
Much of the work we have done has been done together in the group and everyone have contributed with something to every part in both the implementation and the report. However, I will try to state which parts I have mainly been working with in project. 
\\\\
I have mainly been responsibly for the report and the Latex design of it. This has a involved making a structure for references and building a beginning structure for the report.
\\\\
When it comes to the implementation parts I have mainly been involved in writing the parser, used for the interpretation of the input string, together with Oskar. I have also been involved in writing the backend and blocks structure. 
\\\\
In the report I have mainly been writing the introduction chapter, i.e. Problem description and the Theory section involving The blocks world, SHRDLU, Grammatical Framework and A*. I have also been writing Programs and tools, Backend structure and Parser in the chapter Architecture. Furthermore, I have written the result, discussion, conclusion and future work. 
\\\\
I have also written the Reference list and format the documentation, given by the Haddock documentation for the code. But everyone in the group have read the whole report and been making small changes in every chapter.
