\chapter{Conclusions}
Natural languages are very complex since there is many different 	
interpretations. We had long discussions about the meaning of ''Above'' and ''Ontop'' and about the difference of these.  
\\\\
During the project we have learned the importance of having a good heuristic function in A* and the importance of avoiding overestimation. 
Several times when we overestimated the heuristic function our A* algorithm ended up visiting more than 100 times the numbers of nodes. 
 
\section{Future work}
Simple future works we would have done if we had more time would be to optimize the time it take to perform the instructions, restore all blocks that we move when reaching other blocks or positions. We would also have printed what the planner does such as ''I move the topmost block from stack X to stack Y'' and guarantee that the planner always move the block that should be move, instead of moving other blocks to reach the goal state.
\\\\
Another interesting work would be to add the possibility of moving a block inbetween two other blocks.
