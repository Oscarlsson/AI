I have mostly spent all of my time on the Planner and nearly all of it was done
by pair-programming with Oscar Carlsson. In the report, most of my contribution
went to the Planner chapter and also to proofread the report.

In this project, the group members focused more solely on their delegated tasks
and there was less of a mixture of topics per person than in the first project.
This was probably due to a good subdivision of the project into the Planner- and
Parser parts.

However, the group still needed to sit and work together at all times to get any
real work done, which is why we did so most of the time. The reasons have been
mentioned several times already, namely all the discussions and decisions
required to interpret the parse trees. This was actually one of the main
difficulties and we would have benefitted from even more discussions early on.
