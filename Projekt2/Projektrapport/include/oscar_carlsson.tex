I have mostly been involved in work concerning the planner, i.e. implementing A* and tweaking the heuristic. All of this work was done pair programming with John Karlsson. I'm also aware of the problem that Caroline and Oskar dealt with since most of the progress was done when the entire group sat together. \\\\
The planner and the parser was the two different parts of our programand there has been parts of the project which doesn't fit into either. E.g. Making the GUI work and setting up web servers. The group has divided this work equally and i have taken part in some of this work.\\\\
Besides the coding i've tried to call for regular meetings and having a overview of the project to ensure that we make all the deadlines. 
After each meeting we have set a sub-deadline for some funcionality and made a rough plan of how to achieve this goal. Each task was performed in time and the reason why we were short on time in the end was due to a will of learning more rather than bad planning.
