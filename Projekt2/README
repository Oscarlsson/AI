To run the server, first make sure that you have installed Python with
the included CGIHTTPServer script, GF 3.4 via Cabal, and also that the
.gf files are located at ~/.cabal/share/gf-3.4/lib/.

Then cd to Kod/ and run:
$./run_http_server.sh 
to access the server at http://localhost:8000/shrdlite.html

The supplied file planner.cgi can be recompiled using:
$ ghc --make -o www/cgi-bin/planner.cgi plannermove.hs

The program can also be tested using the methods for testing in Test.hs
by running:
$ ghci Test.hs
and then using for instance the command 'runTests', which will run
several test cases that were used during the development, and output
the number of nodes in the frontier at termination of each test case.
